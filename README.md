This repository contains the data for the sub-tasks of FAMuS along with the data preprocessing scripts that can be used to run various models.

FAMuS introduces two sub-tasks aimed at Cross-Document Event Extraction:

1. Source Validation: `data/source_validation/` contains the train/dev/test splits for this task
2. Cross Document Argument Extraction: `data/cross_doc_role_extraction` contains the train/dev/test splits for this task
