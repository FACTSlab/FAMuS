The line \" <event> Left <\/event> a good job in the city \" was written following Fogerty 's discharge from the National Guard , and the line \" rollin ' on the river \" was from a movie by Will Rogers . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> FORTUNATE SON John Fogerty - The 1993 Rolling Stone Interview - PART TWO of Three by Michael Goldberg |... How did you find your singing voice ? The difference between how you sounded on those Golliwogs singles and then on the first Creedence recording is startling . | I was very self - conscious about my voice . What happened was that me and some other guys went up to Portland , Oregon , of all places , during the summer of 1964 . We found a drummer and got a two - week engagement at a club called the Town Mart . At that point , this guy named Mike Burns was the singer . Well , one day I said , \" I 'm going to sing . \" And since I was out of my hometown , away from my parents and any of my friends , I kind of just told myself to go ahead and try it , do n't be shy . And I had taken a reel - to - reel tape recorder up there . I would record whole sets . Then I 'd stay up until sunrise listening to myself And I heard myself improve . I 'd try something like a scream or a hard - edged \" Well ! \" I 'd hear myself try to do it on the tape , and the next night I 'd go back and try something else . As I used to say , I developed a scream in Portland . The first record you made as Creedence Clearwater Revival was \" Suzie Q . \" Did n't you have a very specific purpose in recording that song ? This little underground San Francisco radio station , KMPX [ the first progressive - rock station in America ] , would play all kinds of weird things . I told the other guys that the quickest way we could get on the radio , therefore get more exposure and get this thing going was to specifically go in and record an arrangement of \" Suzie Q \" that could get played on that station . It 's been said that what we were doing seemed very far removed from the rest of San Francisco , but that 's not quite true . '' Suzie Q \" was designed to fit right in . The eight - minute opus . Feedback . Like [ the Paul Butterfield Blues Band's ] \" East - West . \" And especially the little effect , the little telephone - box [ vocal ] in the middle , which is the only part I regret now . It 's just funny sounding . But , lo and behold , it worked ! So the tape got played ? Yeah , they started playing it a lot . That broke the ground for the rest of the stuff . Creedence did n't seem to fit in with the psychedelic lifestyle in San Francisco . Were you guys pretty straight ? [ Laughs ] Well , I never inhaled . I was really Mr. Straight . I was scared to death of LSD or any kind of pill . Yeah , I 'd smoked some marijuana , and the other guy 's , I think , were certainly more experimental than me . But I did n't like it as an image . Since I was the leader , I was the guy with the whip saying , \" No , we 're not going to push this as an image thing . \" But at the same time , I did n't feel that made us the Osmond Brothers either . As Creedence was experiencing some of its first Top Forty success , the Band came along with its album Music From Big Pink ' and got a lot of media attention . They were one of the first bands on the cover of Time' Magazine . To be really honest , I 'd say I was a bit envious . There were a few songs they did that I really loved , like \" The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down \" and \" Up on Cripple Creek . \" But they got all this validation from the critics . Here I was , a competitive guy trying to make my band the biggest thing in the world , and here these guys [ are getting attention ] just ' cause they 're from New York or Woodstock or Big Pink or Bob Dylan or whatever . I was definitely envious of all that , which just shows my own pettiness . Because actually it was a great band , and they made good records . What did your brother Tom do in the band ? Did he actually play rhythm guitar on the records ? Yeah , pretty much . Probably ninety - nine percent of the tracks we did as a quartet are played live with all four guys playing at the same rime . I 've heard the rumor over the years that \" after they left the studio , John went in and re-recorded all the parts . \" No . I think the charm of what you hear on those records is four guys really playing . Let 's talk about some of your best-known songs . \" Proud Mary \" was the first of your original songs to become a hit . In the middle of July of ' 68 , I got my honorable discharge from the United States Army after much consternation . I was overjoyed . This envelope containing this little thing that 's like a diploma had been sitting on the stairs of my apartment building for a couple of days . It said , \" Official Business \" or something . Well , I did n't bother to look close at it . Finally , one day I was coming into my apartment , and I look on the stairs , and , \" Hey , that 's got my name on it ! \" Well , son of a bitch , I opened it up , and I 'm discharged from the army . Holy hallelujah ! I actually went out on the little apartment - building lawn and did a couple of cartwheels . At that one moment it was like \" Wow , all the troubles of the world have been lifted off my shoulders ! \" If it did n't happen within five minutes , certainly within a week and a half I had written \" Proud Mary . \" That one event that led to doing the cartwheels , that 's where \" Left a good job in the city \" comes from . I just felt real good . Although I did n't recall it at the time when I was doing \" Rollin ' on the river , \" there is an old Will Rogers movie about these old paddle wheelers , and I believe at one point they actually sing , \" Rolling on the river . \" I know that buried deep inside me are all these little bits and pieces of Americana . It 's deep in my heart , deep in my soul . As I learned in English 101 , write about what you know about . What inspired \" Born on the Bayou \" ? I would sit there , kind of look at the blank wall in my little apartment , and I just kind of pictured this story . Now around this same time , because of \" Suzie Q \" getting played on the underground radio station , we played the Avalon Ballroom , in San Francisco . We were onstage for a two -minute sound check . I started doing this thing with the guitar , and I started screaming into the microphone what would later become a refined melody but at that moment was just noise , and I had Doug and Stu just play along . I just wanted to hear this energy thing . Anyway , that mythical thing that I was dreaming up at night and that burst of energy on the stage at the Avalon came together . \" Born on the Bayou \" is almost the Gordian knot or the key to what happened later . As I was writing it , it occurred to me that there was more power than just this one song . If there was a way to tie it all together on one album , kind of cross-fertilize , cross - relate the songs , you would have a much more interesting and maybe more powerful image . So that 's what happened . \" Born on the Bayou \" sort of relates to \" Proud Mary . \" It certainly relates to \" Keep on Chooglin \" and \" Graveyard Train . \" \" Green River \" also fits right into what critics started calling bayou rock . \" Green River \" is really about this place where I used to go as a kid on Putah Creek , near Winters , California . I went there with my family every year until I was ten . Lot of happy memories there . I learned how to swim there . There was a rope hanging from the tree . Certainly dragonflies , bullfrogs . There was a little cabin we would stay in owned by a descendant of Buffalo Bill Cody . That 's the reference in the song to Cody Jr. The actual specific reference , \" Green River , \" I got from a soda pop-syrup label . You used to be able to go into a soda fountain , and they had these bottles of flavored syrup . My flavor was called Green River . It was green , lime flavored , and they would empty some out over some ice and pour some of that soda water on it , and you had yourself a Green River . \" Fortunate Son \" it one of your more political songs . It was written , of course , during the Nixon era , and well , let 's say I was very nonsupportive of Mr. Nixon . There just seemed to be this trickle down to the off - spring of people like him . I remember you would hear about Tricia Nixon and David Eisenhower . . . . You got the impression that these people got preferential treatment , and the whole idea of being born wealthy or being born powerful seemed to really be coming to the fore in the late - Sixties confrontation of cultures . How did you come up with \" Bad Moon Rising \" ? I got the imagery from an old movie called The Devil and Daniel Webster . Basically , Daniel Webster makes a deal with Mr. Scratch , the devil . It was supposed to be apocryphal . At one point in the movie , there was a huge hurricane . Everybody 's crops and houses are destroyed . Boom . Right next door is the guy 's field who made the deal with the devil , and his corn is still straight up , six feet . That image was in my mind . I went , \" Holy mackerel ! \" My song was n't about Mr. Scratch , and it was n't about the deal . It was about the apocalypse that was going to be visited upon us . It was n't until the band was learning the song that I realized the dichotomy . Here you got this song with all these hurricanes and blowing and raging ruin and all that , but it 's [ snaps fingers ] \" I see a bad moon rising . \" It 's a happy - sounding tune , right ? It did n't bother me at the time . \" Have You Ever Seen the Rain \" was the last bit the group had before your brother quit Creedence . That song is really about the impending breakup of Creedence . The imagery is , you can have a bright , beautiful , sunny day and it can be raining at the same time . The band was breaking up . I was reacting : \" Geez , this is all getting serious right at the time when we should be having a sunny day . \" PART ONE ( Back ) - PART THREE ( Next ) <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Agent\": [\"John Fogerty\"], \"Theme\": [\"a good job in the city\"], \"Place\": [\"in the city\"]}"}

A week before opening fire on an Orlando nightclub , Omar Mateen was on Facebook . Perhaps he was looking for inspiration : According to the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee , Mateen searched the site for a speech by Abu Bakr al - Baghdadi , the secretive ISIS leader . On the day of the shooting , he allegedly pledged allegiance to al - Baghdadi in a Facebook post . Once dependent on leaflets and videotapes , terrorist groups now use social media as a chief recruiting tool . Facebook , Twitter , and other social networks have responded by accelerating campaigns to shut down accounts that spew pro-ISIS messages on their platforms ; Twitter in particular has seen some success suspending ISIS - affiliated accounts by expanding its teams that watch for objectionable content . But it 's impossible to keep terrorist propaganda off of social networking platforms entirely . Each day , Twitter users tweet an average of 500 million times and more than a billion people log into Facebook . Instead of relying on humans to finger dangerous content , a computer - science professor at Dartmouth is proposing a system that proactively flags extremist photos , videos , and audio clips as they 're being posted online . But the software has been met with reluctance from the very social media companies that would use it , even before it was announced last week . The project 's leader is Hany Farid , the chair of Dartmouth 's computer - science department . Farid 's was the mind behind PhotoDNA , a Microsoft - backed system that detects child pornography as it 's posted online . That service relies on a stock of millions of pornographic images of children collected and maintained by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , or NCMEC . PhotoDNA creates a unique fingerprint of each image called a hash , which can identify the photo even if it 's been manipulated or cropped . It 's used by a long list of major organizations and companies \u2014 from social networks and cloud - storage services to governments and law enforcement agencies \u2014 to prevent images of juvenile sexual abuse from spreading . Microsoft has made the service free and easy for any new online services to deploy . When the service was introduced in 2008 , Farid says , the bulk of the child pornography traded on the internet was in the form of images \u2014 but today , child porn is largely in video form . To catch up , Farid has spent the last eight months updating PhotoDNA to be able to flag video and audio files as well as images . The expanded fingerprinting technology can help broaden the fight to suppress child pornography online \u2014 but Farid has long hoped to use it to attack another genre of offensive content . He teamed up with the Counter Extremism Project , a nonprofit led by a star-studded roster of former government officials , to propose a sister program to PhotoDNA that would help online platforms keep extremist content off the internet . Modeled off the child - porn detection system , the new program would establish a central clearinghouse that would maintain a database of extremist content and distribute unique fingerprints of each photo , video , and audio file to the platforms that want to filter for this content . The clearinghouse would be called the National Office for Reporting Extremism , or NOREX . Researchers at the Counter Extremism Project have been painstakingly collecting extremist content for years , even enlisting crowdsourced help from other social media users to point out offensive accounts . Mark Wallace , the organization 's CEO , proposes starting just by flagging the \u201c worst of the worst \u201d of extremist content : files like ISIS 's savage beheading videos , or audio and video footage of Anwar al - Awlaki 's propaganda speeches . Wallace has high hopes that impeding the spread will discourage terrorists from committing violent acts and hobble their propaganda machine . \u201c Imagine the circumstance if you are that ISIS propagandist , and you were thinking , ' Well , is it really worthwhile torturing this poor soul and killing them on video ? Because the moment I place that video online , it ca n't go viral . ' \u201d he said . \u201c I think that has the potential to be a quite consequential , perhaps game - changing effect on this recruitment and propagandizing . \u201d Wallace and Farid announced the program to a group of reporters last week , and indicated that it would be ready to deploy imminently . Farid said his software would be ready within months , and Wallace said that the project 's leaders had \u201c very collegial discussions \u201d with social - media companies about adopting the new software . \u201c I do n't want to get too over my skis here , but I think there 's a lot of interest , \u201d he said . But to hear those companies tell it , the proposal is far from the brink of adoption . Although there have been months of conversations among the platforms that are most likely to use the software , lingering questions and a history of resentment toward Wallace and his organization have thrown up roadblocks . The conversation began in earnest in late April , when Monika Bickert , Facebook 's head of global policy management , organized a conference call with social - media companies to discuss how to deal with terrorist material on their sites . According to company representatives familiar with the discussion , Bickert shared details about a handful of tools that would flag extremist content online . Although Bickert never mentioned CEP , Wallace , or Farid by name , one of the proposals she circulated was identical to the one CEP introduced Friday . That conversation was polite and productive , but in private discussions , some participants raised concerns about the plan \u2014 and about working with Mark Wallace , who has long been a gadfly circling social - media companies and pushing them to police their newsfeeds and timelines for extremism . The companies are mainly concerned about how to determine the terrorist content that would get flagged . While NCMEC 's database of child - porn hashes is made up of illegal images as defined by the law , it 's harder to establish exactly what constitutes extremist content . Many countries define it very broadly , using the label of \u201c terrorist \u201d to silence dissent or opposition . The job of deciding what counts as extremist and what does n't would fall to NOREX . The images , videos , and audio clips that NOREX determines are extremist would be flagged on participating social media sites , regardless of the context they were posted in . \u201c Unlike child pornography \u2014 which is itself illegal \u2014 identifying certain types of speech requires context and intent , \u201d said Lee Rowland , a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union . \u201c Algorithms are not good at determining context and tone like support or opposition , sarcasm or parody . \u201d ( Wallace says the proposed system would have some sort of appeals process , whereby a user notified that his or her post was flagged could submit a counterclaim for human review . Farid also proposed exempting some accounts \u2014 those operated by media companies , for example \u2014 that could post extremist content without repercussion for educational or news purposes . ) Farid says the pushback from social - media companies is reminiscent of the reaction to his original PhotoDNA proposal in 2008 . At the time , he said , a coalition of technology companies would \u201c dutifully meet and wring their hands \u201d on a monthly basis , but never acted .

Both were born in 1896 ; both came from families that were Austrian in origin but had lived in Prague for generations . And when they met in their first year of medical school they found other things they had in common : a love of research and an enthusiasm for mountain climbing . Yet their backgrounds were very dissimilar . Carl came from a Catholic family which had a history of university professors on both sides . As he wrote in his autobiographical article \" The Call of Science , \" \" It would have been unusual for me to go in a different direction . Rejection of the values of one 's parents was not as prevalent then as it is today , and family tradition was still a strong influence . \" When Carl was two years old , his family moved to Trieste , then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire , where his father was named director of the Marine Biological Station . Carl 's father had studied medicine , but later earned a Ph.D. in zoology . Cori later wrote that \" Trieste was a fascinating city in which to grow up . The early contact in school with different language groups developed in me an immunity against racial propaganda . \" Carl was educated at the classical gymnasium , whose syllabus still included rigorous training in Latin and Greek . Equally important in his education was experience at his father 's research institute . Carl often accompanied his father on field trips on a motor boat to collect marine samples . The elder Cori captained the boat and lectured on geology , botany and the history of the region , with side trips to visit Roman ruins . Summers were spent in the Tyrolean Alps with his extended family where the young Carl Cori developed a lifelong love of mountaineering . Less is known about the background of Gerty Radnitz . She was Jewish . Her father was a chemist who devised a method for refining sugar and became a successful manager of sugar refineries . Her mother , a cultured woman , was a friend of Franz Kafka , the influential novelist . The oldest of three sisters , Gerty was educated at home until ten , when she was sent to a private school . Carl Cori and Gerty Radnitz first met in 1914 \u2014 at the beginning of World War I \u2014 when they entered Carl Ferdinand University in Prague to study medicine . Carl described Gerty as \" a young woman who had charm , vitality , intelligence , a sense of humor , and love of the outdoors \u2014 qualities which immediately attracted me . A very pleasant period followed during which we would plan and study together , or go off on excursions to the countryside , or on a skiing expedition . \" The medical students studied inorganic and organic chemistry , physics and biology in the first year , adding biochemistry , physiology and pharmacology in the second year . This seemingly idyllic student environment ended abruptly when Carl was drafted into the Austrian army in 1916 , during the first World War . Like for so many young men who served in that conflict , the war had a profound affect on Carl 's view of human behavior . In addition , his experiences in the war and its immediate aftermath left him gloomy about the ability of doctors to control disease . In 1918 Carl was assigned to a barracks that served as a hospital for infectious diseases near the front lines on the Piave River in Italy . Disease was rampant , and \" the influenza epidemic with its high mortality rate among the poorly nourished soldiers and civilians and the inability to be of any help came as a great shock to me . \" After the war , Carl and Gerty were reunited . In 1920 they received their medical degrees and published their first joint research paper . That same year the young couple was married in Vienna , where they were pursuing postdoctoral studies . Carl split his time between the Internal Medicine Clinic and the Pharmacology Institute , both at the University of Vienna . He was able to conduct research , a rarity due to the economic deprivation of post - War Europe , because his father sent him a shipment of frogs . He used the animals to study the mechanism of the seasonal variation of the vagus action of the heart . Gerty Cori worked in pediatrics at the Karolinen Kinderspital ( children 's hospital ) , where she conducted research on temperature regulation before and following thyroid treatment and published several papers on blood disorders . Carl Cori wrote many years later that \" life in Vienna had its compensations , \" but in fact it also had its deprivations , and Gerty developed symptoms of xerophtalmia , a condition caused by vitamin A deficiency and which was cured only when she returned to Prague , where she ate a better diet . Because of the difficulty of life in Europe and because Gerty was Jewish and a woman , which made finding an academic position difficult , the Coris decided to investigate immigrating to the United States . In 1921 Carl interviewed for a position at the State Institute for the Study of Malignant Disease ( now Roswell Park Memorial Institute ) in Buffalo , New York . But when he heard nothing further , he accepted a position instead with Otto Loewi in the Pharmacology Department at the University of Graz . Gerty remained in Vienna at the Children 's Hospital . Carl Cori found working with Loewi , who discovered that acetylcholine was the substance that led to vagus stimulation of the heart , intellectually rewarding . It was also a period in his life when he planned for the future . It was while he was at Graz that Cori decided to study intestinal absorption and the metabolism of sugar in animals . Family tradition holds that Gerty 's interest in sugar metabolism stemmed from her father , who when be became diabetic , said to his daughter , who was a doctor , \" Find me a cure . \" But despite the joy of working with Loewi , Carl found the atmosphere at Graz disturbing . The living conditions were poor , and it had been necessary for him to prove his Aryan descent to obtain employment at the university . So determined were the Coris to leave Europe that they applied to the Dutch government to serve as doctors in Java . But the offer eventually came from Buffalo , and the Coris eagerly accepted . My grandfather , that is , my mother 's father , toward the end of his life became diabetic and he said to his daughter , who was a doctor , ' Find me a cure . ' \" \u2014 Tom Cori , Living St. Louis , a production of KETC in St. Louis , Missouri . Carl and Gerty Cori : A Truly Collaborative Relationship Carl Cori accepted a position as a biochemist at the State Institute for the Study of Malignant Disease in Buffalo , N.Y. , in 1922 . Gerty Cori joined him six months later , after taking a position as an assistant pathologist . The two were never apart again professionally . At the beginning of their tenure at the Institute , the Coris encountered opposition to their working together . Gerty Cori was told she would lose her job if she strayed from her laboratory in the pathology department . Soon , however , their colleagues came to understand and respect the Coris wish to work together , which they did until Gerty 's death in 1957 . In 1931 Carl Cori was offered the chairmanship of the pharmacology department at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis . The offer came as something of a surprise , since his only previous academic experience was as a one - year adjunct assistant professor at the University of Buffalo . As chairman , Cori had to run the department , equip a research laboratory , and teach medical students . Gerty Cori received a research position in the same department , with only a token salary . Years later , when she was ill , Gerty told Mildred Cohn : \" I do n't feel guilty about accepting my full salary [ now ] in spite of my frequent absence , because when Carl and I first came here , they paid me 10 percent of that they paid him . \" In his autobiography , Carl Cori related one other incident when the Coris encountered opposition to their working collaboratively . He was offered a position at a good university , with three stipulations : That he take speech lessons , that he cease working on insulin , and that he stop collaborating with his wife . He declined because the last two stipulations were unacceptable . On one visit to the university , Gerty was told that it was \" un - American \" for a husband and wife to work together . Eventually most opposition to their working together melted away , but Gerty Cori did run up against other forms of gender discrimination . When the Coris were hired at Washington University , she received one-tenth Carl 's salary , even though they were equal partners in the laboratory . Theirs was a truly collaborative relationship . Their son Tom says his mother had the ideas ; then they both would go into the laboratory to execute the idea or disprove it . Their closeness extended beyond their scientific endeavors ; as Mildred Cohn , who knew the Coris and has written about them , relates , they complemented each other intellectually : \" She would start a sentence , he would finish it . \" Carl Cori summed up the nature of their partnership in his remarks at the Nobel banquet in 1947 : \" Our collaboration began 30 years ago when we were still medical students at the University of Prague and has continued ever since . Our efforts have been largely complementary , and one with the other would not have gone as far as in combination . \" They were a remarkable pair . Gerty would have flights of fancy . She 'd come up with extraordinary ideas . Cori had the ability to put them into concrete questions to answer . And therefore as a team they were extraordinary . \" \u2014 David Kipnis , postdoctoral fellow in the Coris ' laboratory at Washington University The 1947 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology : Discovery of the \" Cori Cycle , \" \" Cori Ester \" and Glycogen Synthesis Carl and Gerty Cori spent more than three decades exploring how the human body metabolizes glucose . It was known in the 1920s that faulty sugar metabolism could lead to diabetes , and it was also known that insulin kept the disease in check . The effect of insulin on blood sugar levels had been observed , but scientists did not understand the biochemical mechanism behind insulin 's effect or how carbohydrates were metabolized .

As a result the club entered the 2009\u2013 10 season with a ten -point deduction imposed by The Football League . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Southampton have been effectively relegated after being docked 10 points by the Football League . The ruling comes after Saints ' parent company went into administration , though the club and administrators say they expect to launch an appeal . Four points off safety with two games to go , Saints will lose 10 points if they stay up in the Championship . And if they do not avoid finishing in the bottom three then the points penalty will take effect next season . The south coast outfit had hoped to avoid the punishment as they argued that it was their parent company Southampton Leisure Holdings plc ( SLH ) which had gone into administration on 2 April - not the football club . But a League investigation by \" independent forensic accountants \" found that the football club and SLH were \" inextricably linked as one economic entity \" and applied their mandatory penalty . The League also found that : \" The holding company has no income of its own ; all revenue and expenditure is derived from the operation of Southampton Football Club and the associated stadium company . \" The holding company is solvent in its own right . It only becomes insolvent when account is taken of the position of Southampton football club and the other group companies . \" The statement added that there was no alternative other than to invoke the 10 - point penalty . It was also revealed that the company commissioned to look into the matter reported that co-operation with them was withdrawn towards the end of their enquiries . However , Mark Fry , joint administrator of SLH , insisted he was \" shocked and extremely disappointed \" with the League 's decision to deduct points . Former chairman urges fans to back club \" The football club was not even aware that the investigation had been concluded , \" he told the BBC . \" We remain very firmly of the view that the rules do not apply , and that the Football League has stretched the rules to meet the circumstances . The football club is not in administration . \" The Football League is a members ' organisation , and with any such body of that nature , you run the risk that if there is any grey area , they can interpret the rules as they see fit . \" I think they 've interpreted the rules to suit the conclusion they wanted to reach . \" It is expected that an appeal will be launched . \" Leon Crouch , who has had two spells as chairman of the football club , hit out at the \" terrible timing \" of the League 's decision . He told BBC Five Live Sport : \" Southampton Leisure Holdings and Southampton Football Club are two separate companies . \" Mark Fry is the administrator for SLH , he 's not the administrator for the club . We 're not in administration , we 're paying our bills and I do n't see how they can take these points off us . \" Southampton Football Club was set up so that if this ever happened , we would not have these points deducted - it 's the way they have interpreted the rules . \" I think we have a very strong case , I hope we appeal and we now have to focus on winning against Burnley on Saturday , we need to safeguard our Championship status and then hopefully have this decision overturned - then we 'll be back where we belong next season . \" Responding to Crouch on Five Live Sport , Football League chairman Lord Mawhinney said : \" What he said that was of particular interest of me was when he said this structure was set up to avoid the football club having a penalty if it got into financial trouble . The board is acting on sound legal advice , implementing the rules the clubs themselves wanted put in place Football League chairman Lord Mawhinney \" We have looked carefully at the holding company 's annual accounts , which include the football club , we sent forensic accountants into the company - not Football League staff , but people whose expertise is to get to the bottom of relationships between companies - and we have taken external legal advice . \" It 's quite clear the holding company and the football club are inextricably linked as one economic entity . \" All of the evidence pointed us to the conclusion that an administrator has been appointed that covers the club or aspects of the club as well as the holding company , and that being the case , we had no flexibility under Football League regulations - we had to apply sporting sanctions . \" It 's worth pointing out that those sporting sanctions were agreed by all the clubs . This is not a runaway decision - the board is acting on sound legal advice , implementing the rules the clubs themselves wanted put in place . \" The 10 - point deduction for Football League clubs entering administration was introduced in 2004 , with Wrexham the first League team to suffer a deduction in the 2004\/05 season . In 2007 , the rule was amended so that clubs going into administration after the fourth Thursday in March would have the 10 - point deduction suspended , after Leeds United and Boston United both entered administration when they were all but relegated , just before the end of the 2006\/07 season . The 72 League clubs ' chairmen unanimously backed the measure , so that if a club entering administration after the deadline escaped relegation , the 10 points would be deducted that season - but if they were relegated anyway , 10 points would be taken off the following season . Mawhinney explained : \" The clubs decided the sporting sanctions would have effect - so if a club was already going to be relegated , it ought not to get an advantage by going into administration and taking a 10 - point hit when it was going to be relegated anyway . \" He also hit back at claims that the club were not given enough notice , adding : \" Towards the end of the process , the club withdrew its co-operation from the process , so we had to move to a conclusion one way or the other . \" Once the decision was made , the club were notified before any public statement was made . \" Southampton are the fifth Football League team to be deducted points this season - Darlington entered administration , while Luton , Bournemouth and Rotherham were all penalised for coming out of administration without a Company Voluntary Agreement in place , as per the League 's insolvency guidelines . The punishment means Southampton are looking at life in English football 's third tier for the first time in 50 years . The 1976 FA Cup winners enjoyed a 27 - year stay in the top flight before the club were relegated in 2005 . BBC South Today 's Tony Husband added : \" It 's been a blame game for the last four years at Southampton since they were relegated from the Premier League , with different sets of directors blaming each other for the ills of the club . \" Former chairman Rupert Lowe is deeply unpopular with many supporters and will undoubtedly shoulder much of the blame , but it would be unfair to say this is a mess totally of his making . \" For 30 years , Southampton were held up as one of the most well - run , friendly and organised clubs , a small - town team punching above its weight by virtue of good management , but this is now a club on its knees - it 's been a footballing catastrophe . \" <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Place\": [\"Football League\"], \"Activity\": [\"season\"], \"Agent\": [\"Southampton Football Club\"]}"}

The Economist cited its <event> reopening <\/event> as a mosque as an example of eradication of the Armenian cultural heritage in Turkey . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Two vast and ugly blocks of stone The prime minister looks on a city 's works , and despairs STATUES in Kars are not safe when Recep Tayyip Erdogan is around . When Turkey 's prime minister visited the city last year , the local mayor , who belongs to Mr Erdogan 's mildly Islamist Justice and Development ( AK ) party , sought to avoid his ire by ordering the removal of a public fountain featuring bare - breasted nymphs . Last week , during another trip to Kars , which lies about 45 km west of the border with Armenia , Mr Erdogan called for the demolition of a local monument designed to promote reconciliation between Turks and Armenians . The statue , of two 30 - metre - tall concrete figures reaching out to each other , was , he said , a \u201c freak \u201d . Mr Erdogan insisted that his distaste was purely aesthetic . Yet some suspect him of pandering to nationalist sentiment in the run - up to elections in June . Many Turks see the statue as an admission of Armenia 's charge that the slaughter of up to 1.5 m Armenians by Ottoman forces in 1915 amounted to genocide . In 2009 the then mayor of Kars , Naif Alibeyoglu , who had commissioned the statue , was forced out under pressure from Mr Erdogan and the city 's 20 % ethnic Azeri population ( egged on by Azerbaijan , which disliked Turkey 's efforts to make peace with Armenia ) . Mr Erdogan has backed away from a set of protocols signed with Armenia in 2009 that foresaw the establishment of diplomatic relations and the reopening of borders . These were sealed in 1993 after Armenia 's short war with Azerbaijan over the mainly Armenian enclave of Nagorno - Karabakh . Mr Erdogan insists that the protocols can only be ratified if Armenia withdraws from seven regions it occupies around the enclave . Armenia is threatening to scrap the deal altogether . But there is also a whiff of Islamic orthodoxy in the air . Mr Erdogan 's tirade against the Kars statue included references to Hasan Harakani , an ancient Muslim scholar buried nearby . \u201c They erected a strange thing next to his mausoleum \u2026 it is unthinkable , \u201d he complained . Many Muslim scholars consider statues to be idolatrous , and other AK officials have not disguised their aversion to them . Ankara 's mayor , Melih Gokcek , has systematically dismantled statues erected by his pro-secular predecessors . \u201c I spit on this kind of art , \u201d he once said . Mehmet Aksoy , the designer of the Kars monument , says that the government risks being seen as \u201c the Taliban \u201d if it presses its demands .

It has closed its New Zealand operations after many decades of publishing in this country . Bauer Media NZ publishes entertainment , lifestyle and current affairs titles including the New Zealand Listener , Woman 's Day , New Zealand Woman 's Weekly , North and South and Next , along with a digital network . All New Zealand Bauer staff were advised on Thursday morning that the business was no longer viable and that it intended to close . Staff said it had come as a complete shock and many were unprepared to offer comment as they digested the news . READ MORE : * Can this man save Woman 's Day ? Bauer 's new boss has a 2 - year plan * Restrictions on previously ' non-essential ' media eased just a fraction * Coronavirus : What are essential services ? * NZ Herald owner confirms closure of Radio Sport EY has been appointed to work alongside Bauer New Zealand to facilitate an orderly wind - down of the business . The media industry is suffering a drop in revenue as all sectors of the advertising market cut back on their marketing during the lockdown . NZME has closed Radio Sport with immediate effect and is understood to be consulting staff about redundancies . Ugh , I 'm heartbroken . Numb . Ca n't comprehend Bauer NZ closing . So many close friends who became wh\u0101nau . Almost my entire career history . Such iconic titles . Kia kaha to my former colleagues doing it tough today . Mag hags 4 lyf xxx \u2014 Seb van der Zwan ( @sebonsafari ) April 1 , 2020 Bauer chief executive Brendon Hill said : \" Magazine publishing in New Zealand is currently suspended as part of the New Zealand Government 's decision to move to the Covid - 19 level four restrictions . \" We understand the New Zealand Government 's decision to move to Covid - 19 level four , but it has put our business in an untenable position . Publishing in New Zealand is very dependent on advertising revenue and it is highly unlikely that demand will ever return to pre-crisis levels . I 've been made redundant , along with the rest of Bauer NZ . I 've absolutely loved my year at Metro , have loved working for @Henry__Oliver and with @jeaninprogress . Under no illusions as to how hard it will be to find more work in media right now , but you never know what 's next . x \u2014 the big gun herself ( @tnichss ) April 1 , 2020 \" In response to the situation , Bauer carried out an urgent review of its New Zealand operations and considered all options to keep part or all the business open , including engaging with the New Zealand Government . \" An active search is under way to find buyers for our New Zealand assets , including our many iconic titles , however , so far an alternative owner has not been found . \" Broadcasting , Communications and Digital Media Minister Kris Faafoi said the Government could have provided half - a-million dollars for Bauer through the wage subsidy scheme or the business finance guarantee but the company had not sought that . \" In recent conversations I had with Bauer , they indicated they were not interested in seeking any forms of Government assistance . I also note that Bauer had indicated for some time , as have other media organisations , that they were facing challenges around viability of their operations here in New Zealand before the Covid - 19 pandemic . Bauer 's management ruled out other options that may have kept at least some staff employed and some of their magazine assets available in New Zealand . \" I further note that Bauer is looking for buyers for its New Zealand assets and I do n't want to interfere in that process . Government is looking at the overall state of New Zealand media 's health and sustainability in light of COVID - 19 , and there will be more news to follow on this in due course . \" Ruth Cobb , general manager of PrintNZ , said the Bauer titles were a significant portion of New Zealand 's printing industry 's work . Many were the specialist sort of content that people wanted to read in print format and would not transfer well to online , she said . \" It 's a devastating blow for print in New Zealand overall but in particular for the Auckland market and the company that prints these magazines . \" The magazines are printed by Webstar . Bauer staff would get full redundancy pay and leave entitlements . \" I would like to recognise the impact that this decision will have on our suppliers , customers and the wider publishing industry . This is a very difficult time for the entire media industry , \" Hill said . Former Metro editor Bill Ralston said the decision was tragic . The killer blow had been the \" dumb \" Government ban on magazine sales during the lockdown period , he said . An exemption classifies media companies NZME and Stuff as essential businesses and allows them to publish their daily and Sunday newspapers . The Magazine Publishers Association had lobbied the Government to be allowed , too , but was refused . Only a \" very limited \" number of community newspapers in the more remote parts of the country would be allowed . Cobb said the sector would try to approach the Government again . Ralston said : \" It was bad enough they were fighting a recession in terms of advertising revenue ... for the Government to ban all weekly and monthly publications was the dumbest decision it ever made . \" He said it made little sense because the magazine staff were working from home and the publications were printed in the same facilities that produced daily newspapers . \" There 's unlikely to be additional risk . \" Ralston said it was also a morale blow to New Zealanders who were stuck at home , and wanted magazines to read . \" Eighty years of the Listener gone because some clod in Government decided to ban the publication . \" It would probably start of wave of closures of other magazines and community newspapers , he said . \" They were struggling to survive already - how many will reopen after the Government ban ? Very few , if any . \" A former Bauer employee who did not want to be named said she was not surprised . \" It was always coming - advertising has been grinding to a virtual halt for the past couple of years . There are some amazing journalists working at Bauer , but it struggled to move with the times , and find its niche in the online world . I 'm incredibly sad for them , and it shows very clearly how important it is for every business to remain forward - focused . \" The decision to close the business is effective as of April 2 . According to Roy Morgan research , between June 2018 and June 2019 , readership of the New Zealand Listener dropped by 1.1 per cent to 231,000 readers compared to the same time the previous year . Meanwhile Kia Ora , Air New Zealand 's inflight magazine had a readership 2.8 per cent decline to 112,000 . This would also have been heavily affected by the airline 's flight cuts in response to Covid - 19 . An Air New Zealand spokeswoman said the airline was \" saddned \" to hear of the closure and was working through next steps to determine its future . \" The publisher has been a great partner of the airline since 2006 and has printed more than 160 editions of Kia Ora Magazine in that time . \" Other popular magazines under the media organisation such as NZ Woman 's Day , Australian Women 's Weekly NZ and NZ Women 's Weekly also saw declining readership compared to the previous year . But Metro magazine had an increase in readership of 0.1 per cent to a readership of 57,000 .

Blayzbloo also has a multiplayer variant of Free Battle Mode , where players can compete with other people who have downloaded the game to their DSi , up to four people per match . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Blayz Bloo : Super Melee Action Battle Royale Review ( DSiWare ) A royale pain Version Reviewed : North American Arc System Works ' BlazBlue fighting games , with their unique anime- style visuals and enjoyable fighting engines , have become quite popular among fans of the genre . Of course , this makes it all the more confusing to see them take such a high - quality series and dumb it down for their DSiWare spinoff release Blayz Bloo : Super Melee Action Battle Royale . Now instead of one - on - one fighting action , you get a 4 player beat 'em up that feels like a far less playable version of Super Smash Bros . The basic gameplay premise of BlayzBloo is quite simple . Using a basic set of attack and jump moves , you must battle it out against the three other players on the field . While the simple attack will prove to be your most frequently used offensive weapon , you 'll also have a special Drive Move for times when you need to lay a little extra beat down . You 'll even find treasure chests popping up around the stage that contain specialty items to be picked up and used against your opponents . Of course , the lack of any type of block move means that you 'll also have to spend some of your time moving away from attacks in order to survive as well . When you take on the game as a solo experience , you can do so in one of several ways . The matches can be played by three different rule sets : a Life Match pits you in an all - out duel to be the last character standing whereas a Points Match can be won by the character with the most earned points at the end of the round . The game even offers up a Flag Match that allows all players to fight over a cute little Panda Flag , with the character left holding it at the end of the round being the winner . In the single player mode , you 'll take on the game 's five basic stages in order , each with their own unique set of rules . And if you 'd like to customise things a bit more , you can choose to play in Free Battle Mode where you can choose the sets of rules and the stage . If you 're feeling a bit competitive , the game also offers up a multiplayer Free Battle Mode , which basically plays exactly as it does in the Single Player \u2013 only this time , you can bring in other players who have DSi systems and a copy of the game . While this does n't add much in the way of playability , it 's still a nice feature for those who like to play with friends , although a download play function might have made it a bit more enticing . The controls themselves function fairly well , but it 's the serious lack of depth that ultimately hurts the playability the most . The simple attack system never feels like it offers up enough variety , and once you 've exhausted the minimal set of variations , there 's not much left to enjoy . Couple this together with a sometimes cheap AI system and you 've got a gameplay experience that 's not only overly rudimentary , but also somewhat frustrating to boot . The cel-shaded visuals are certainly easy on the eyes , but much like the control system , the visuals are fairly basic in design . You wo n't see a lot of flashy detail throughout the various stages , and even the silky smooth animation of the characters is n't enough to improve the overall experience too much . The same goes for the musical performance \u2013 there are a few interesting tracks to enjoy , but that 's if you can somehow ignore the rather annoying voice announcer and character sound effects that muddy up the audio . Conclusion As a general rule , when you start messing with a winning formula , bad things tend to follow . Blayz Bloo is n't a terrible game , it 's just terribly mediocre . When you factor in the extremely limited content with the very bland and shallow gameplay system , you get a fighting experience that you 'll likely be tired of within the first 15 minutes of playing it . Even diehard fans of the series might want to pass on this rather lacklustre spinoff and instead stick to the far more creative standard releases . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Agent\": [\"players\"], \"Place\": [\"Free Battle Mode\"], \"Part\": [\"the sets\"], \"Feature\": [\"of rules and the stage\"]}"}

Established in 1864 , it is one of the longest continually owned farms in New Zealand . The high - country sheep farm covers just over 2600 hectares at the head of the Tasman Valley in South Canterbury 's Mackenzie country , bordering Lake Pukaki and the Tasman River . The station was settled in 1864 by Scottish pioneering migrants Andrew and Catherine Burnett . Their son Thomas Burnett later took over the property and was MP for Temuka electorate until his death in 1941 . Thomas Burnett 's son , Donald Mt Cook Burnett , then actively ran the property for 69 years until 2010 , when he died aged 95 . During his long tenure , Burnett built one of New Zealand 's first private hydro-electric plants in 1953 , was one of the farmers behind the installation of the world - famous sheepdog statue at Lake Tekapo , and was named as the world 's leading merino woolgrower when he won the inaugural World Challenge Trophy in 2000 . His sister Catriona , who also lived on the farm , died last year at the age of 97 . Neither sibling had any children and the property was now owned by the Burnett estate . It was being sold through a tender process , with tenders closing mid-February . The farm stocked more than 1500 Saxon merino ewes , hoggets and rams , and grazed beef cattle in summer . It has 68 kilometres of fencing . Real estate sales agent Nick Young , from Bayleys , said the property was being offered for sale either as one unit , or broken down into the 1312ha Mt Cook Station block , the 1366ha Cox 's Downs block , and the 36ha House block . The property had a six-bedroom homestead , a farm manager 's three - bedroom home , plus sleepouts , shearers ' quarters , a barn , hayshed , stock shed , woolshed , tractor shed , and two - bay garage . Mt Cook Station 's terrain varied from flat on the lowlands , to steep hill country , and altitudes ranged from 540 metres to 1000 m above sea level . Young said the new owner could add tourism to the station 's revenue stream by catering for Alps to Ocean Cycle Trail riders or eco-tourists , and offering onsite activities such as deer , tahr and chamois hunting , fishing , and tramping . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Food\": [], \"Place\": [\"Mt Cook Station\"], \"Ground\": [\"just over 2600 hectares at the head of the Tasman Valley in South Canterbury 's Mackenzie country , bordering Lake Pukaki and the Tasman River\"], \"Agriculturist\": [\"Thomas Burnett\"], \"Time\": [\"until his death in 1941\"]}"}

What five ?

These , monks , are the five dangers of reciting the Dhamma with a musical intonation . ( A.iii.250 ) Comments The sacred discourses of the Buddha are full of meaning . When reciting and listening to them it is vital to reflect on the meaning as well as to listen with respect and devotion . Reciting suttas is the traditional method for preserving the sacred texts , and passing them on to future generations . It should not be allowed to degenerate into a form of entertainment . While listening to discourses , the devotees should sit with hands in a\u00f1jali , paying respectful attention . The way of chanting by many monks these days is incorrect , and contrary to the Vinaya rules , because they are striving to make a melodious sound rather than merely striving for clear pronunciation of the words . Buddhist monks should regularly teach the meaning of frequently recited suttas such as Metta Sutta , Mangala Sutta , Ratana Sutta . Every Buddhist devotee should be very familiar with these discourses , and most could probably recite them by heart . However , if the meaning is not understood , the excellent Dhamma teachings contained in these discourses will not be put into practice . \u00a9 You may print any of these books for your own use .

During a development interview , design director Jonathan Biddle discussed the concept in these terms : \" Water is so universal ... The basics of freezing water to make ice and <event> boiling <\/event> it to make steam are things that no one needs explaining to them . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Interviews : Curve Studios - Fluidity \/ Hydroventure Developers spill about Fluidity Fluidity was recently released on WiiWare in North America and we were very impressed with the game 's unique approach and fluid execution . With the game making its debut today on the European WiiWare service under its new moniker Hydroventure , we thought it might be a good time to sit down with developer Curve Studios to find out a little bit more about the rather unique physics - based adventure . Jonathan Biddle ( affectionately known as Bidds to his friends ) , the Design Director at Curve Studios and director of Fluidity \/ Hydroventure , was kind enough to take time out of his busy schedule to answer a few of our questions . You can find out what he had to say to us in the exclusive Nintendo Life interview below . Nintendo Life : Can you tell us a little bit about Curve Studios and what key games you have worked on in the past ? Bidds : Curve Studios was formed in 2005 by a number of industry veterans with the express intention of working on smaller games , such as digital download and handheld . We 'd been through the mill on larger , big - budget titles many times before and decided that , with Curve , we 'd like to instead create something that was small and perfectly formed . We 're best known for our work on Sony 's Buzz ! franchise on PSP , and while we 're proud of those games , it 's not really representational of who we are as a developer . We 're very creatively - driven , working hard on making inventive video games with a lot of heart . Although players are only now getting their hands on our first original titles , we 've been slaving away over these for years ; we created the Fluidity concept in 2006 , and started development in 2008 . Explodemon was first started in 2005 . NL : As an established PlayStation developer , why did you decide to develop a game for WiiWare ? Bidds : We 've always been platform- agnostic as a developer . We create original ideas and then target them towards the platform that we 're developing them for . The idea for a water game first came up in 2005 , but it was n't until we saw the Wii Remote that it really took shape . We knew that tilting a controller and having water react on - screen exactly as it would in real life would create an immediate and intuitive interface that people would n't need explaining to them . It was at this point that we knew we had a great WiiWare title . NL : Nintendo published your game on WiiWare - how did this come about ? Bidds : We met up with our eventual Nintendo producers , Masa Miyazaki and Azusa Tajima , at GDC in 2008 and pitched a couple of ideas to them , including Fluidity . After listening patiently , they were very complimentary and said that we 'd pitched some really fresh ideas . They got back shortly after to say that they liked to go forward with an experiment with Fluidity . NL : In North America we know your game as Fluidity , but this was changed to Hydroventure for Europe . What were the reasons behind the name change ? Bidds : This was simply for legal reasons . Fluidity did n't pass Nintendo 's legal and trademark checks in Europe . NL : How did you come up with the game concept for Fluidity ? Bidds : The idea of making a game based on water was originally discussed in 2005 . Water is so universal ; it 's used by everyone in all walks of life every day , and always in a positive way . We have fun in it , clean ourselves with it , drink it , cook with it , it 's even a part of our weather and strongly associated with life and the planet . We all learn about water 's basic properties in science class at school too . The basics of freezing water to make ice and boiling it to make steam are things that no one needs explaining to them . We thought that all of these elements could be brought together to make a great game with really unique mechanics , and when we saw the Wii Remote , we instantly saw how it could be done . NL : What difficulties did you face in developing a physics - based game , particularly with water which is notoriously tough to replicate ? Bidds : The game 's physics system was built organically over the course of the game . We started by creating the water physics and then layered the other elements over the top , for example , adding objects that the water could carry and making them interact with the world . As the game developed we added motors , joints , and the other elements , each time ensuring that they worked with what we had . This meant that the gameplay never outpaced the technology , instead growing together and supporting each other . Working with water as a main character was incredibly hard , however . In most video games , players control a single character that can only be in one place at once . The typical things that you use to control a game 's level design \u2013 such as triggers , switches , enemy AI \u2013 normally rely on a single player position . This was thrown out of the window for Fluidity , since the player could be in hundreds of places at once . We had to devise a system that catered for this in all circumstances , which took a lot of time to get right . NL : The controls handle very well for both newcomers and seasoned players . How did ensure the game handled well for everyone ? Bidds : The original concept we had for the game 's controls \u2013 tilt to move and lift to jump \u2013 went in from the beginning and just worked really well . However , because of the game 's water , we had to do a lot of work on the jump . Normally in a game , you let a character jump once and then not jump again until they have landed on the floor . This is n't possible with water , since we ca n't tell when the water has hit the ground , since it 's not a single entity - some of it might have , while some of it might not . The concept of the water being on the ground just does n't exist . Instead we allowed the player to jump whenever they wanted by lifting the world , even if they were in mid-air . We had to put a delay in after this however - otherwise they could repeatedly jump the water up and up , until it flew up into the sky ! We matched this style of jump control with level design to ensure that it worked well with the kind of challenges we were setting . We thought about putting the jump onto a button press but , aside from not having any buttons left , it did n't make any sense , nor feel right . Something was lost when the tactile , physical interface was removed . In Fluidity , you 're not making a character jump , but instead interacting with the world in a physical manner . We focused on ensuring that the jump worked well when instigated correctly and we 've found that \u2013 once players have got used to the lifting action and the kind of game Fluidity actually is \u2013 it works perfectly . We do have some tips to share though . During play testing , we noticed players holding the Wii Remote in certain positions that made it more difficult for them . In order to get the best out of the game , players should not tilt the Wii Remote past the vertical position , since the game does n't recognise angles past that point . While jumping , they should lift the Wii Remote perpendicular to its upwards face , not trying to ' scoop ' it around corners , for example . Also , players should ensure that the Wii Remote is facing upwards , in the position shown in the opening image of the game . If you follow these tips , you 'll get a perfect control experience . Interestingly , we did a lot of user testing , and found that the difference between those who played games a lot and those who did n't was n't as profound as you 'd normally find . We put this down to the intuitive interface and also because there had n't been a game about water before , so effectively everyone was a beginner . NL : Very few WiiWare titles features the degree of polish found in Fluidity . How were you able to squeeze so much detail and variety into such a small file size restriction ? Bidds : One of the benefits of having Nintendo as a publisher is that they commit to delivering a very polished game . They always pushed us just that bit further than we were used to , and were very supportive in helping us make the game everything it could be . Nintendo also really understands video games . They were always on hand to offer advice or a different way of looking at things , and we were able to collaborate really effectively on all development issues across the course of the game 's creation . It really was a great development experience working with Nintendo , and I think it shows in how well executed Fluidity is . NL : There would seem to be a lot of ideas left to explore with the gameplay scheme you 've created . Any chance we 'll see a sequel ? Bidds : Fluidity was , for us , a big , enjoyable gameplay experiment . We pushed the concept in so many directions , trying out lots of ideas and gradually refining it until we found the sweet spot . Now that we 've got a magic formula , we feel that there are lots of ways we can improve and build on it . Of course , given that Nintendo is the publisher , it 's really down to them . I 'm sure some great sales and positive comments from the game 's fans would really help ! NL : Given the tilt function of the upcoming 3DS system , do you think Fluidity would be a good fit for the system ? Bidds : We 're really excited for the 3DS - we were totally blown away when we saw the 3D effect in action . It 's clearly going to be an outstanding system , so we 'd love to be able to bring Fluidity to it . The gyro sensors in the 3DS would mean that our control scheme would carry across unchanged , so we do feel that it would work well . It 's up to Nintendo whether that becomes a reality though ! NL : The visuals are probably the most stand - out aspect of the game . What prompted the mix of detailed elements on abstract - like backdrops ? Bidds : The visual style of the game changed hugely from its initial concept . We originally wanted the game to look like an airline safety card that had come to life . When development started , we took this further when we began looking towards an educational presentational style , so that players would be learning about water and all of its properties by reading a futuristic interactive book . The book concept remained throughout development , but we found the educational style too plain and dry , so we evolved the style to become much more colourful and friendly . Since it is essential that the game objects can be seen at all times , they were designed to pop out of the background , but because <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Cook\": [], \"Heating_instrument\": [], \"Container\": [], \"Time\": [], \"Place\": [], \"Food\": [\"water\"], \"Temperature_setting\": [\"boiling\"]}"}

LONG ISLAND , NY \u2014 Law enforcement is on high alert \u2014 and has offered a hefty reward \u2014 after discovering \" credible \" information that the deadly MS - 13 street gang has issued chilling orders for members to assassinate police officers on Long Island . The MS - 13 gang has sent out a battle cry , stating it was time to \" take back streets ... and take out a cop . \" MS - 13 is a brutal street gang that has set up deadly cartels marked by indiscriminate killing in major cities and small towns across the United States \u2014 including an escalating stronghold on Long Island , where sleepy towns have been the scene of blood - soaked murders and machete violence . Find out what 's happening in Riverheadwith free , real - time updates from Patch . A $ 25,000 reward has been offered by Suffolk County Crime Stoppers for information that leads to an arrest in connection with threats to harm police officers . The Nassau County Police Department was laser- focused Friday with an intelligence bulletin in mind that was issued about the threat to law officers ; on Wednesday , the Hempstead Police Department reported receiving information from a credible informant stating that MS - 13 was \" looking to shoot a cop in the Hempstead area . \" Find out what 's happening in Riverheadwith free , real - time updates from Patch . Police said they were looking for a tall , light - skinned Hispanic man with tattoos of three dots next to his eye . He reportedly told the informant that police had been making too many arrests and it was time to \" take the streets back and take out ( shoot ) a cop like we do in El Salvador , \" police said . Any member of MS - 13 had permission to carry out the attack , the informant reportedly said . The Suffolk County Police Department said it was aware of \" credible threats of violence that MS - 13 is prepared to harm a police officer in retaliation for gang arrests . \" The department has taken necessary precautions to protect its officers , officials said in a release . \" While the Suffolk County Police Department takes this threat seriously , we will not be deterred in our mission by threats by gang members , \" the release said . \" Our commitment in bringing gang members and their associates who commit crimes to justice continues to be a top priority . \" Police were warned to safeguard personal information , especially on social media . \" It is imperative that members of the department take these threats seriously and adapt their work habits and lifestyles accordingly , \" the Nassau County Police 's bulletin said Thursday . Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder issued a statement on the potential violence : \" I will not tolerate any threats against my officers and the Nassau County Police Department will continue to protect our residents and communities . \" Residents , he said , should call 911 immediately if they see or hear anything suspicious regarding any threats . Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa \u2014 the red- beret wearing crime fighter who has fought violence in New York City for years with volunteers patrols who carry no weapons \u2014 was skeptical about the alleged threat . \" I highly doubt it , \" he said . \" The feds just arrested a key ' shot caller . ' \" On Thursday , the highest - ranking member of the East Coast cliques of MS- 13 was arraigned in Nassau County on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and trafficking drugs , authorities said . His arrest was a major blow to the gang , authorities say . Miguel Angel Corea Diaz , aka Reaper , 35 , of Laurel , Maryland , was arraigned in Nassau County on Thursday before Acting Supreme Court Justice Patricia Harrington on three counts of operating as a major trafficker and five counts of second -degree conspiracy . If convicted of the top charge against him , Diaz faces up to 25 years to life in prison . Sliwa said Diaz was brought him from the beltway outside of Washington , D.C. \" Feds ca n't have it both ways , \" Sliwa said . \" They said in court that MS - 13 gang members had to get permission from the ' Reaper ' to commit various crimes , including murder . All of a sudden , having no contact with the Reaper , they 're going to hunt down and shoot cops ? \" Instead , Sliwa said he believes law enforcement will \" use it as a reason to crack down on MS - 13 locally , so that they can justify those raids , \" he said . A Nationwide Spotlight On Gang Brutality After brutal murders of four teens shocked the nation and the world , President Donald Trump spoke in Brentwood last year about the insidious MS - 13 gang that 's been terrorizing local communities across Long Island in the county . And in his speech , he promised to rid the gang - ravaged communities of Long Island of the \" animals \" on their streets . Long Island has been hit hard , with 17 \" beautiful young lives \" murdered since Jan. 16 on Long Island alone , including two teen girls , he said during his speech . \" They butchered those little girls . They kidnap . They extort . They rape and they rob . They prey on children . They should n't be here , \" Trump said . MS - 13 beats with victims with clubs , slashes them with knives and machetes , he said . \" They 're Animals \" \" They have transformed peaceful parks and beautiful , quiet neighborhoods into blood - stained killing fields . They 're animals , Trump said . Days after the gruesome discovery of four bodies in Central Islip on Long Island \u2014 the four young men are believed to have been victims of the deadly MS - 13 street gang \u2014 the spotlight has been steadily shining on Suffolk County as lawmakers , educators and a horrified public try to unravel MS - 13 and seek answers on how to stem the tide of brutality . MS - 13 , which was formed in Los Angeles in the 1980s by immigrants fleeing El Salvador 's civil war , is known for its bloody violence , including machete attacks and home invasions . But for all the public outcry , for those directly impacted by the quadruple homicide in Central Islip , the heartbreak is deeply personal . The four young men found dead on the night of April 12 at Central Islip Recreation Village Park suffered trauma from a sharp- edged instrument . They were only 16 , 18 , 18 and 20 years - old ; their lives just beginning . One of the victims , Jorge Tigre , a Bellport High School honor student , was not a gang member and allegedly became a target after he refused to associate with gang members following the murder of two girls in Brentwood , Nisa Mickens and Kayla Cuevas , who were murdered in September , 2016 by MS - 13 gang members with machetes . Tigre 's sister Monica Tigre , in an interview with Patch , declined to discuss what may have led to her brother 's murder , but said she and her family are left with only memories . \" The only thing I can said he was a wonderful person . He was always smiling and helping my family and me . I will remember him \u2014 his smile and his kindness , \" Tigre said . One Former MS- 13 Member 's Story Trying to illuminate the dark reality of an MS - 13 member 's life , * Elmer \u2014 his real name was withheld to protect his identity \u2014 a former MS - 13 member who was able to escape the gang 's tentacles and is now a member of Council for Unity , a non-profit organization that works with schools and jails to help gang members find new lives , shared his story with Patch . Telling his story , Elmer said : \" I joined the MS - 13 gang right after my mom died . I was 8 - years -old . The gang was , for me , a new life , a new family . \" After an initiation when he was jumped , Elmer said , \" They showed me everything I needed to know and then I started a new life by busting gangs , robbing , beating our enemies , doing any type of drugs every day , every night , shooting people , drinking every day . \" When he was 13 , Elmer said he was shot three times and almost lost his leg . \" I've been shot , stabbed almost to the point of dying and still did n't come to my senses . I spent my young life mostly in jail because of the violent and criminal things that I did . I lost two of my best friends when I was 15 , \" he said . Elmer said he made the decision to leave the gang because he was tired of \" seeing young people on the street getting killed every day . I was tired of funerals . Tired of watching kids join gangs , doing drugs in their early age . I decide to change when I saw two friends get hit with a straight bullet . . I 've made too many mothers cry . I refuse to let another tear be shed because of me . \" Spread of MS-13 Across The Nation The recent murders have put the insidious gang violence on Long Island on the international canvas , with the world watching and wondering how such gruesome violence has come to infiltrate sleepy , suburban communities . Sliwa spoke to Patch about the path MS - 13 has taken to Long Island . \" There was a very violent civil war in El Salvador from 1980 to 1992 . In 12 years 75,000 people were killed . It created a refugee crisis and many El Salvadorians fled North to Los Angeles . They settled in Mexican neighborhoods and immediately were preyed upon by the largest Los Angeles street gang , the 18th Street gang , which got started in Los Angeles in 1965 , \" he said . \" In order to protect themselves from the 18th Street gang , the El Salvadorians formed MS - 13 and started to defend their turf . And even though they were outnumbered they proved to be durable and extremely vicious . \" The \" Mexican Mafia , \" which controlled the Latinos in the California prison system , had MS - 13 join their ranks , Sliwa said . Next , Sliwa said , as El Salvadorians migrated east , looking for work , they landed in large numbers , first in Fairfax County , Va , . which is right outside of Washington , D.C. \" They then followed the trail up into Nassau and Suffolk counties , where there was a lot of day laborer work , \" he said . \" In the early 90s they embedded themselves into Fairfax County and in the late 90s they began to spread into Long Island . Along the way , MS - 13 started to recruit Guatemalans and Hondurans who were also being picked on by the Mexican 18th Street gang . \" The machete is a hallmark of bloody MS - 13 crime , Sliwa said . \" Unlike other gangs , which prefer guns , Ms -13 uses the machete as a weapon of terror . They will slash their victims , slice off fingers and limbs and on occasion , behead their intended targets . It is done to silence any potential snitches . \" Enforcement Efforts To Reign In The Mayhem From the federal government to local law enforcement , officials appalled by <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [\"On Thursday\"], \"Place\": [\"in Nassau County\"], \"Defendant\": [\"Miguel Angel Corea Diaz\"], \"Judge\": [\"before Acting Supreme Court Justice Patricia Harrington\"], \"Charges\": [\"on three counts of operating as a major trafficker and five counts of second -degree conspiracy\"]}"}

Creating a nostalgic world peopled with silver - hammered Maxwells and Lovely Ritas entitled them to live amid Strawberry Fields forever . Britain 's Blur has done the exact opposite . Thrashed by the tabloids and tax - bracketed out of the indie cred they so desire , they have abandoned the clever and distinctive cast of snobs , blokes , madmen and rakes that starred in their five previous albums and turned the spotlight inward to cast light on their own woes . The result is a mundane work that not only fails to live up to the band 's spirited canon , but never manages to give its subjects ( heartbreak , fatigue , etc. ) fresh consideration . Blur has never had problems re-adapting . From the blithe posh boys of their first two LPs , they ascended to the high - concept reaches of \" Park Life , \" with its punters and small-timers , and the suburban archness of \" The Great Escape . \" By 1997's \" Blur , \" the group had opted away from their mock- xenophobia and turned to American indie rock to inspire the fuzz- pedal rush . The changes that arrive with \" 13 , \" however , are fitted around the well - worn theme of loss . A longtime lover departs and the band 's privacy is shredded . But is celebrity ennui a fitting topic for a concept album ? The British have a great word -- \" whinging \" -- to characterize the subject of Blur 's current fixation . A cross between whining and complaining , whinging aptly describes the endless cant of \" 13 . \" The album 's opener , \" Tender , \" is the grandiose signal of the band 's transition to downbeat . Tender is one thing that Blur is not and never has been . Sarcastic , glib , witty , mordant , eccentric ? Yes ! Tender ? No . And not even the song 's gospel choir can convince us otherwise . As the album continues , breaking down every synthetic pop structure in its path , Graham Coxon 's staticky , grease - splattering guitars rush far beyond the morose mutterings of singer Damon Albarn . Lovely interludes of warped ice-skating music pop up from time to time , but as the band veers from dub to prog rock to Casio -core , the album takes on a psych- ward dementia , finding anchor only in the echoes of their older , more confident songs . That said , a shitty Blur album is still better than a lot of bands ' best efforts . Coxon 's talent for composing bizarre melodies is uncanny , and when he is n't too busy spazzing out here , he comes up with some great guitar lines , especially on his own song , \" Coffee & TV . \" And Albarn 's despair at losing his girl makes for some interesting cracks in the accented vowels of his British drawl -- the screaming , unstable laugh he lets loose on \" Swamp Song \" is the record 's vivid high point . I truly hope that whatever solace there is for Blur to find in their cold and uninviting situation is swift in its arrival . I also hope that maybe someday they 'll follow a bread - crumb trail back home . Ladybug Transistor THE ALBEMARLE SOUND | MERGE BY DOUGLAS WOLK | Sometimes it takes a while for bands to find a voice . Ladybug Transistor 's first album , 1995 's \" Marlborough Farms , \" was a competent Pavement rip-off with some curious touches in its arrangements , like singer Gary Olson 's trumpet parts . In the intervening years and two subsequent albums , Olson has replaced the rest of the band , expanded it to a sextet and discovered the delights of Donovan and Zombies records . On \" The Albemarle Sound , \" he 's modulated his voice to a carefully enunciated purr and surrounded it with snatches of strings , horns and penny whistles , for an exquisite psychedelic - pastoral effect . The production pulls off tricks that nobody 's used much for 30 years ( arranger Joe McGinty , who puts together the \" Loser 's Lounge \" series of ' 60s \/ ' 70s pop tributes in New York , helped out ) -- most notably , almost every sound is doubled , from Olson 's baritone to the clean , jazzy guitar and bass tones to the stoner 's lope of the saxophones and snare . The piano is just old and tacky - sounding enough ; the apple-eating sound effects in the middle of \" The Swimmer \" recall the Beach Boys ' \" Vegetables . \" There 's a new and marvelous detail every few seconds , and they 're all balanced to feng shui perfection . In the middle of the album , though , there 's a luscious , concise song called \" Like A Summer Rain \" that outshines its surroundings -- and it 's a cover ( of a Jan & Dean obscurity ) . It points to the biggest weakness of \" The Albemarle Sound , \" which is that the band 's songs simply are n't up to the level of its arrangements . They 're non-obvious and inoffensive , and the calm stateliness of the instrumentation makes them sound like vintage AM - radio singles , but they 're also not that memorable on their own . Still , a few tracks here come close to the ideal Ladybug Transistor are aiming for , notably the acid fantasy \" Meadowport Arch \" and the instrumental mariachi-western theme \" Cienfuegos . \" The band 's got its style down fine ; it 's just still working on what to apply it to . Nixon 's Head GOURMET | GROOVE DISQUES BY DAEN EDEN | When a band kicks off its album with the intro of \" I Want to Hold Your Hand , \" and keeps pumping that riff throughout the number , the listener may make one of three assumptions . Either A ) the band is too lame to come up with an original idea , B ) they are record snobs , proud to wear their influences on their sleeves or C ) they are record snobs , proud to wear their influences on their sleeves -- and yet , amazingly , truly have something original to offer . In the case of Nixon 's Head , the answer is C. Their use of the Beatles riff in \" Saturate , \" the leadoff cut on \" Gourmet , \" is a statement of purpose . It heralds a 14 - course ear candy pig-out courtesy of some exceedingly choosy epicures of pure pop . \" Gourmet , \" the first full - length release from Nixon 's Head , marks the return of the Philadelphia - based group after an eight - year hiatus . In their original incarnation , they made the world safe for alternative rock with such releases as the lighthearted EP \" The Doug Factor . \" Since then , they have lightened their punk edge , moving on to songs that have greater melodic and musical depth . ( A good comparison would be \" English Settlement \" - era XTC , though that is due more to shared influences than actual homage . ) There is a refreshing lack of irony on \" Gourmet . \" Admittedly , the more humorous tracks , particularly \" The Loving Finger \" ( sung by guest vocalist Dorothy Haug ) , would in lesser hands be downright embarrassing . Somehow , in Nixon 's Head 's care , such songs seem positively wistful . ( It helps that Haug has the clear , unaffected voice of a Pennsylvanian Emmylou Harris . ) Although \" Gourmet \" may not be , as its cover boasts , \" five minutes ahead of its time , \" it can take its place among the sharpest and freshest pop albums since Stiff Records ruled the earth . Friends of Dean Martinez ATARDECER | KNITTING FACTORY BY DOUGLAS WOLK | The thing about secret weapons is that they 're only useful if they 're a secret . The first two Friends of Dean Martinez albums were mostly driven by Joey Burns and John Convertino , who were moonlighting from their main band Giant Sand . Steel guitarist Bill Elm brought elegance and spookiness to their instrumental drift -- essentially a homage to the ' 50s easy - listening guitarists Santo & Johnny , with elegant touches of modernity and pre-modernity . With \" Atardecer , \" though , Burns and Convertino are gone ( they 've started their own band , Calexico ) , and Elm is running the show -- the only other musician to appear on more than four tracks is keyboardist \/ percussionist Dave Lachance . ( Lachance gets a pretty inconsequential solo piece of his own , \" Coppertone . \" ) Elm has also given up the band 's sweet simplicity in favor of turbulent sound textures and spacey effects , turning the tints he used on the band 's black - and - white - photo sound into the entire picture . There 's a certain kinship between the suspended , drifting tones a steel guitar can generate and the idea of electromagnetic impulses from interstellar space , and it 's been reinforced in the popular imagination by the note-bending whines of sci-fi TV show themes . Elm 's playing on that association here , augmenting most of the album with spacy Moog doodles , giving his guitar the crinkling distortion of old Pink Floyd records , and drenching it in oh-wow - man reverb . But there 's very little on \" Atardecer \" that approaches the melodic savvy of the sun-baked retro-instrumentals that used to inspire the Friends . \" Spoonie ( Dark Side of the Spoon ) \" is a particular offender -- over five minutes of portentous tom-tom and chirruping noises run through a delay pedal , with no particular tune . Even when they try to play something that might have fit on the first album , like the organ simmer and samba beat of \" Otra Vez , \" Elm 's tone calls too much attention to itself , like a loud , tipsy guest at a party . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Configuration\": [\"a mundane work\"], \"Agent\": [\"Blur\"], \"Theme\": [\"13\"]}"}

Hossam al - Shurbagi and Kamel al - Shaarawi , members of the Doctors Syndicate 's committee for aid to Gaza and responsible for three warehouses that were raided in northern Sinai , were arrested , Shurbagi told AFP from in detention . A security official said that the two were accused of illegally storing goods . Shurbagi said the aid was being stored pending a reopening of the Rafah crossing , which Egypt closed on February 5 to all but exceptional cases after opening it to aid and wounded Palestinians during Israel 's war on Hamas . During the 22 - day conflict , which ended on January 18 , the Egyptian authorities several times prevented the Brotherhood -- of which Hamas is an offshoot -- from demonstrating and delivering aid to Gaza . More than 1,000 members of the banned movement were arrested during the Israeli offensive while trying to take part in demonstrations in support of Gaza , with most subsequently released . Egypt has refused to open Rafah permanently in the absence of EU monitors and representatives of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas after Hamas ousted his forces from the territory in deadly fighting 18 months ago . The Muslim Brotherhood is banned by the government but fielded independent candidates in 2005 parliamentary elections , winning a fifth of the seats despite fraud and police intervention . Arrests of its supporters have increased since the group 's success in the election , in which it contested a limited number of seats . Copyright \u00a9 2011 AFP . All rights reserved .

At Wimbledon , she <event> reached <\/event> her first grand slam singles final in three years but lost in straight sets to first time grand slam finalist , Petra Kvitov\u00e1 . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> The unstarry , unaffected Petra Kvitova , a 21 year - old from the Czech Republic who thinks of herself as a \" jeans and T-shirt \" kind of girl , and who could not even tell you who her favourite clothes designer is , played with a nerveless ease to defeat Sharapova on Centre Court for her first grand slam title . It had been widely supposed that this title - match would bring a comeback victory for the world 's highest - earning sportswoman , for the groomed and polished Sharapova , for the lady whose face has launched a thousand advertising campaigns , yet she was beaten by someone who does not appear to know how good she is . Kvitova , ranked eighth in the world , certainly does not have the look of an athlete who has spent much time considering her own worth . Had Sharapova won this match , kisses would have been blown to all corners of Centre Court ; in the moments after Kvitova 's 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 victory , which she had completed with an ace banged through into the backstop , the Czech sat on her chair with her hands covering her mouth . During an on- court interview with the BBC , Kvitova broke off and half turned away when she thought that Sue Barker was finished with her , so looking every bit like someone not used to what happens after winning a title on a big occasion . Soon after being presented with the Venus Rosewater Dish , she walked off the turf and was shown the honours board , which already had her name on it , and she let out a little embarrassed giggle , and she was then a touch self - conscious and awkward , though obviously pleased too , after she took the trophy out the back of the stadium to show the crowds . So Kvitova became the youngest Wimbledon champion since Sharapova won this title as a 17- year - old in 2004 . Whenever anyone looks back to that final , when Sharapova defeated Serena Williams , they remember it as the afternoon when she gave birth to a brand . While no one is ever going to win Wimbledon and keep a low profile , it did not feel as though this was the moment that launched Kvitova as a megastar . That is not to criticise or to patronise her ; not everyone can have , and not everyone wants to have , Sharapova 's life . Though Sharapova and Kvitova are both very tall , very modern Eastern Europeans who cuff the ball , they are plainly not two chips from the same Eastern Bloc . Sharapova was born in Siberia ; but she is really a product of Florida and that tennis factory known as the Nick Bollettieri Academy . Kvitova , who was born in the Moravian - Silesian region of the Czech Republic , still lives in the family home in the small town of Fulnek . Whatever Kvitova lacked in poise after the match and between points , she showed plenty when the tennis was actually being played . Plus , a lot of strength in her arm . There have not been many occasions in Sharapova 's tennis life when she has been out -hit , but this was one of them , as Kvitova prevented Sharapova from winning her first grand slam since the 2008 Australian Open and since the operation to her shoulder . Once again , Sharapova had some problems with her serve . In her semi-final against the German wild card Sabine Lisicki , Sharapova had struck 13 double - faults , and she committed another six in this final , including a run of three in a row spread over two games . But Sharapova , who had reached the final without dropping a set , did not beat herself with her own serving yips ; she was beaten by Kvitova 's fine grass - court tennis . When Kvitova arrived at the All England Club last summer she had never won a match on grass ( she had lost her first four appearances on the surface ) , and then she made the semi-finals , She came back this year and won the whole thing . What was so welcome about this result was that Kvitova was playing freely and taking big swings ; in contrast , you could say , to the careful , overly - defensive play from Caroline Wozniacki , who is officially the best player in the women 's game , but who is yet to win a major . This was one for the lefties . No longer do you have to cast around in the Royal Box for the last left-hander to have won this tournament . Given all the supposed advantages of being a leftie on a grass court , it is strange to think that , before this match , the last southpaw champion was Martina Navratilova , the winner here in the summer of 1990 . That was when Kvitova was just four months old . Navratilova was here to see this . In the Open era , only four left- handed players have appeared in grand slam finals \u2013 Ann Jones , Monica Seles , Navratilova and now Kvitova . However , you could say that , for a moment or two , this was an all - left-handed final . Sharapova , who is ambidextrous , played left-handed until she was 10 , and on a couple of occasions , after being sent wide on what would have been her backhand side , she switched the racket into her other hand and attempted a leftie forehand . The most emotional moment came when Kvitova looked up at Navratilova and also at Jana Novotna , who had previously been the last Czech woman to have won this tournament with her victory in 1998 . Kvitova 's eyes turned pink and puffy . Kvitova had been oblivious to Sharapova 's grunting . The fact that she had played the shrieking Victoria Azarenka of Belarus a round earlier was probably useful as it meant that she had recent experience of dealing with a screamer . But perhaps she would have been oblivious anyway . Kvitova was oblivious to a lot of things . She just went out there and played , hit the ball hard and won Wimbledon . Everything else , you could say , is just nonsense and fripperies . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Theme\": [\"Sharapova\"], \"Goal\": [\"the final\"], \"Place\": [\"Wimbledon\"]}"}

Faced with mass poverty in the United States during the Great Depression , president Hoover advocated against the use of government programs , which he feared would lead to mass dependence on government <event> aid <\/event> , to alleviate the issues facing the country at the time . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> | Printable Version | Herbert Hoover , \" Rugged Individualis m \" Campaign Speech Digital History ID 1334 Author : Herbert Hoover Date : 1928 Annotation : In 1928 , the Republican party nominated Herbert Hoover , a world famous mining engineer and Secretary of Commerce under Harding and Coolidge , for the presidency . In this speech , which closed his successful presidential campaign , Hoover , a self - made millionaire , expressed his view that the American system was based on \" rugged individualism \" and \" self -reliance . \" Government , which had assumed unprecedented economic powers during World War I , should , in his view , shrink back to its prewar size and avoid intervening with business . During the early days of the Great Depression , Hoover launched the largest public works projects up until his time . But he continued to believe that problems of poverty and unemployment were best left to \" voluntary organization and community service . \" He feared that federal relief programs would undermine individual character by making recipients dependent on the government . He did not recognize that the sheer size of the nation 's economic problems had made the concept of \" rugged individualism \" meaningless . Document : I intend ... to discuss some of those more fundamental principles upon which I believe the government of the United States should be conducted .... During one hundred and fifty years we have builded up a form of self government and a social system which is peculiarly our own . It differs essentially from all others in the world . It is the American system .... It is founded upon the conception that only through ordered liberty , freedom and equal opportunity to the individual will his initiative and enterprise spur on the march of progress . And in our insistence upon equality of opportunity has our system advanced beyond all the world . During [ World War I ] we necessarily turned to the government to solve every difficult economic problem . The government having absorbed every energy of our people for war , there was no other solution . For the preservation of the state the Federal Government became a centralized despotism which undertook unprecedented responsibilities , assumed autocratic powers , and took over the business of citizens . To a large degree , we regimented our whole people temporally into a socialistic state . However justified in war time , if continued in peace - time it would destroy not only our American system but with it our progress and freedom as well . When the war closed , the most vital of issues both in our own country and around the world was whether government should continue their wartime ownership and operation of many [ instruments ] of production and distribution . We were challenged with a ... choice between the American system of rugged individualism and a European philosophy of diametrically opposed doctrines doctrines of paternalism and state socialism . The acceptance of these ideas would have meant the destruction of self - government through centralization ... [ and ] the undermining of the individual initiative and enterprise through which our people have grown to unparalleled greatness . The Republican Party [ in the years after the war ] resolutely turned its face away from these ideas and war practices .... When the Republican Party came into full power it went at once resolutely back to our fundamental conception of the state and the rights and responsibility of the individual . Thereby it restored confidence and hope in the American people , it freed and stimulated enterprise , it restored the government to a position as an umpire instead of a player in the economic game . For these reasons the American people have gone forward in progress .... There is [ in this election ] ... submitted to the American people a question of fundamental principle . That is : shall we depart from the principles of our American political and economic system , upon which we have advanced beyond all the rest of the world .... I would like to state to you the effect that ... [ an interference ] of government in business would have upon our system of self - government and our economic system . That effect would reach to the daily life of every man and woman . It would impair the very basis of liberty and freedom .... Let us first see the effect on self-government . When the Federal Government undertakes to go into commercial business it must at once set up the organization and administration of that business , and it immediately finds itself in a labyrinth .... Commercial business requires a concentration of responsibility . Our government to succeed in business would need to become in effect a despotism . There at once begins the destruction of self -government .... It is a false liberalism that interprets itself into the government operation of commercial business . Every step of bureaucratizing of the business of our country poisons the very roots of liberalism that is political equality , free speech , free assembly , free press and equality of opportunity . It is not the road to more liberty , but to less liberty . Liberalism should not be striving to spread bureaucracy but striving to set bounds to it .... Liberalism is a force truly of the spirit , a force proceeding from the deep realization that economic freedom cannot be sacrificed if political freedom is to be preserved . [ An expansion of the government\u00eds role in the business world ] would cramp and cripple the mental and spiritual energies of our people . It would extinguish equality and opportunity . It would dry up the spirit of liberty and progress ... For a hundred and fifty years liberalism has found its true spirit in the American system , not in the European systems . I do not wish to be misunderstood .... I am defining general policy .... I have already stated that where the government is engaged in public works for purposes of flood control , of navigation , of irrigation , of scientific research or national defense ... it will at times necessarily produce power or commodities as a by-product . Nor do I wish to be misinterpreted as believing that the United States is a free - for- all and devil- take - the-hindmost . The very essence of equality of opportunity and of American individualism is that there shall be no domination by any group or [ monopoly ] in this republic .... It is no system of laissez faire .... I have witnessed not only at home but abroad the many failures of government in business . I have seen its tyrannies , its injustices , its destructions of self - government , its undermining of the very instincts which carry our people forward to progress . I have witnessed the lack of advance , the lowered standards of living , the depressed spirits of people working under such a system .... And what has been the result of the American system ? Our country has become the land of opportunity to those born without inheritance , not merely because of the wealth of its resources and industry but because of this freedom of initiative and enterprise . Russia has natural resources equal to ours .... But she has not had the blessings of one hundred and fifty years of our form of government and our social system . By adherence to the principles of decentralized self - government , ordered liberty , equal opportunity , and freedom to the individual , our American experiment in human welfare has yielded a degree of well - being unparalleled in the world . It has come nearer to the abolition of poverty , to the abolition of fear of want , than humanity has ever reached before . Progress of the past seven years is proof of it .... The greatness of America has grown out of a political and social system and a method of [ a lack of governmental ] control of economic forces distinctly its own our American system which has carried this great experiment in human welfare farther than ever before in history .... And I again repeat that the departure from our American system ... will jeopardize the very liberty and freedom of our people , and will destroy equality of opportunity not only to ourselves , but to our children .

In what Christians call the \" Old Testament \" , Christians believe the Bible teaches that , through sacrifice , one 's sins can be forgiven ( Judaism categorically rejects this idea , holding that <event> forgiveness <\/event> of sin is exclusively through repentance , and the role of sacrifices was for atonement of sins committed by accident or ignorance ) . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Soc.Culture . Jewish NewsgroupsURL : www.scjfaq.org\/faq\/11-08-02.html www.scjfaq.org\/faq |< Q11.8.1||TOC ||Q11.8.3 >| It is important to note that in Judaism , sacrifice was never the exclusive means of obtaining forgiveness , and was not in and of itself sufficient to obtain forgiveness . For some transgressions sacrifice was not even effective to obtain forgiveness . Jews believe that sacrifice is the least important way to gain forgiveness from G-d. Repentance is more important . Very few sins required sacrifice ( per Leviticus ) . For example . , the animal sacrifices are only prescribed for unwitting or unintentional sin ( Leviticus 4:2 , 13 , 22 , 27 ; 5:5 , 15 and Numbers 15:30 ) . The one exception is if an individual swore falsely to acquit himself of the accusation of having committed theft ( Leviticus 5:24 - 26 ) . Intentional sin can only be atoned for through repentance , unaccompanied by a blood sacrifice ( Psalms 32:5 , 51:16 - 19 ) . This is re-enforced : \" And you shall call upon Me , and go , and pray to Me , and I will hearken to you . And you shall seek Me , and find Me , when you shall search for Me with all your heart \" ( Jeremiah 29:13 ) . Given its relative unimportance even in Biblical days , what comprised an acceptable Jewish sacrifice ? Many people think that Jewish sacrifice required blood sacrifice . This is not true . The primary commandment about blood is that it should n't be eaten . ( Leviticus 17:10 ) \" And any man from the house of Israel , or from the aliens who sojourn among them , who eats any blood , I will set My face against that person who eats blood , and will cut him off from among his people . \" This can be paraphrased : \" Do n't eat blood . \" The next phrase ( Leviticus 17:11 ) goes on to say , \" For the soul of the flesh is in the blood and I have assigned it for you upon the altar to provide atonement for your souls ; for it is the blood that atones for the soul . \" This explains why blood is not to be eaten , and that when it is used as part of a sacrifice it must be sprinkled on the altar of the Temple . Note that it does n't say , \" blood is the only way to atone \" it says that you should n't eat the blood because its only use is for sacrifice . Since this is a little confusing lets use an example : we can say that all little boys are people , but does that mean that all people are little boys ?. So Leviticus says \" Do n't eat blood . You can use it for sacrifice , \" but it does n't say that blood is the only acceptable sacrifice . What is an acceptable sacrifice ? Well , we know what is n't : the Torah strictly forbids human sacrifice , unlike most religions of the Biblical era . What kind of sacrifices were allowed ? Throughout the Book of Leviticus , only distinct species of animals are permitted for use in blood sacrifices . There is also atonement by a cereal offering ( Leviticus 5:11 - 13 ) , atonement by gold ( Num. 31:50 ) , and atonement by the burning of incense : \" So Moses said to Aaron , ' Take a censer and put fire in it from the altar , put incense on it , and take it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them ; for wrath has gone out from the L-RD . \" ( Numbers 17:11 ) . Remember that prayer and repentence must accompany sacrifices . There were two kinds of offerings that related to sin : Chatas , a sin offering : A chatas was only brought for sins whose punishment is an early death caused by G-d where the person 's violation was n't willfull , but could have been prevented with more care . Criminal negligance . There were also national chatas offerings , e.g. if everyone followed a ruling of the High Court , the Sanhedrin , which in retrospect was in error . There is also a chatas brought on other situations : one was brought by the nation each month , by someone at the end of his nazarite vow ( to atone for not fully partaking of G-d 's world ) , and other relatively rare cases . Asham , a guilt offering : There are two instances where one brought an asham . The first is where one is uncertain whether one is supposed to bring a chatas . The second is someone who stole from or caused financial damage to another . He repays the injured party , in many instances with a penalty fine . However , he needs not only forgiveness from the other person , but also from G-d . That is achieved with the asham . When Jews were not near the Temple ( they lived too far away , or were captives as in Babylon ) sacrifice was not done by them . King Solomon said that even in the days of the Temple prayer could be used by those away from the temple to obtain forgiveness ( I Kings 8:46 - 50 ) . Synagogues from the time of the Temple have been excavated by archeologists . They were used , as they are today , for prayer . Once or twice a year sacrifices were sent to the Temple from these Synagogues . Now that there is no Temple there are no sacrifices . In accordance with the words of Hosea , we render instead of bullocks the offering of our lips ( Hosea 14:3 ) ; i.e. , prayer and repentence .

Osseointegration is similar to the process of using magnets , except the nose prosthesis is attached directly to the face instead of through magnetic forces . Eyeglass frames can be worn with the artificial nose attached underneath . However , if the patient 's face is too flat , the glasses have potential to slide down from gravity . Adhesive substances , such as glues , bind the prosthetic nose to the face , but they are n't used as much anymore since they irritate the skin and damage the prosthesis when it is removed . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Building faces : Getting a new nose and the art of prosthetics By Ginny Stein Former funeral director Steve Sparks has faced his mortality several times . \" First was an artificial eye and then I had a liver transplant , which I am very , very grateful for . Then an artificial nose , artificial dentures and a surgical procedure on my ear , \" he says . One year ago doctors told Mr Sparks they would have to remove his nose because of skin cancer . \" I was absolutely devastated . I mean , all I had was visions of having this huge hole in my face , \" he says . \" The first reaction was ' Oh , I am just going to have to lock myself away in a room for the rest of my life ' . \" The surgery to remove his nose was a success , but afterwards Mr Sparks faced a new struggle . \" I had a lot of bandages so I looked a bit like Hannibal Lecter , so that was really bad . You just did n't want to go out , you scared the little kids , it was just horrifying , \" he recalls . He admits it took him a while to be able to face a mirror . \" I was barely recognisable . It was something I had to build up the courage for . \" But Mr Sparks will soon be receiving a new nose , designed for him by a team of specialists at Royal Melbourne Hospital . First , titanium implants were drilled into the bone in his face . Then , while waiting for the bone to grow around those implants , a new prosthetic nose was made . It comes complete with magnets , which will allow it to be snapped on and off his face . Mr Sparks says it will be a wonderful feeling to have a nose again . \" [ It is ] exciting because I am going to be able to do things that I have n't done for more than 12 months now , which is to put my head under the shower and just have the water on my face , \" he says . Royal Melbourne Hospital has the biggest facial prosthetics centre in the country , dating back to World War II , when it helped rebuild the faces of wounded veterans . For the centre 's prosthetist Greg Peart , designing noses , eyes , ears , fingers and toes involves working with a medical team to complement his technical and artistic expertise . \" There are a dozen different types of vein colours that you can add to the silicone in rayon flock , \" he says . \" The tones there are an incredible palate of colours , that come in artist oil tones . \" The mixing of those in the formula required to match the individual is the aim of the game . \" Royal Melbourne Hospital surgeon Patrishia Bordbar completed 17 years of training - first in dentistry , then medicine and surgery - to become one of only a handful of maxillofacial surgeons currently operating in Australia . She says the making of prostheses is an ancient art . \" If you go back to the development of facial prostheses you can actually date it back to ancient Egypt and China , \" she explains . \" Human beings have always tried to replace missing body parts and facial parts ... facial prostheses made out of wood , gold , clay and silver . \" She says prosthetic design has evolved significantly over the years . \" Initially they were taped and adhesives were used , but this was frustrating for people because they would have to apply the adhesives daily . \" The maintenance was quite difficult and there was the social embarrassment when they became dislodged . \" Dr Bordbar says two thirds of patients at the prosthetic centre are skin cancer patients . \" It 's certainly becoming more of a clinical situation we 're seeing , partly because the incidence of skin cancer in Australia has been rising , particularly over the last few decades , \" she says . But advances in medical science also mean surgeons can now operate on patients when they previously could not . \" For the tumours that were deemed inoperable , patients received palliative care so further treatment could n't be offered , \" Dr Bordbar says . \" Nowadays , as we 're able to more safely operate on some of these tumours , we 're left then with a reconstructive conundrum . \" Dr Peart is worried about what the increasing demand will mean for both his team and the growing number of people who need help . \" People find they have to lobby for support in getting to Melbourne to get the prosthesis made , \" he says . \" It 's difficult , but if there is First World cancer treatment there should be a First World facial prosthetics rehabilitation to back that up . \" If they are going to take parts of the face off , then restoration through prosthetic rehabilitation is the way to go . \" <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Items\": [], \"Agent\": [\"Steve Sparks\"], \"Time\": [\"soon\"], \"Place\": [\"Royal Melbourne Hospital\"], \"Item\": [\"prosthetic nose\"], \"Connector\": [\"magnets\"], \"Goal\": [\"face\"]}"}

As of Monday morning , Santa Clara police had taken at least 20 reports from the crime spree that may have involved as many as 20 teens punching and in some cases using stun guns on patrons attending the park 's 10th annual Halloween Haunt . Police Lt. Dan Moreno said as of Monday afternoon , the Saturday night skirmishes yielded reports of 15 thefts \u2014 ranging from strong - arm robberies to purse snatchings and the like \u2014 four assaults , and one public-intoxication case . Just one member of the teen mob was arrested , a minor booked on suspicion of theft . Park visitors reported seeing other suspects elude capture by getting into waiting cars . \u201c I have never seen something like this at Great America where there were this many thefts in such a short time , \u201d said Moreno , who has policed Santa Clara for 28 years . That was echoed by Dennis Speigel , president of the consulting firm International Theme Park Services . \u201c I do n't know of any case like this , \u201d he said . \u201c Certainly not of a recent time . Of course this happened during Halloween , which amplifies the problem because of the costumes . \u201d Santa Clara police said the mayhem broke out about 10:30 p.m. Saturday at Halloween Haunt , which helped attract upward of 20,000 visitors to the park ; the weekend before Halloween is typically the busiest of the year for the October festivities . Investigators believe that a group of between 15 and 20 teen boys were responsible for the attacks , robberies , and thefts , but have not determined how they were affiliated . \u201c They were organized in the sense that they all agreed to or know what they were doing , \u201d Moreno said , adding that the payoff of increasingly expensive smartphones has emboldened thieves in general . \u201c You have teenagers with $ 800 phones in their hands , creating the temptation to knock it to the ground . \u201d Victims and patrons reported encountering groups of robbers , some armed with stun guns , who weaved through crowds stealing mobile phones , purses , and backpacks . Some panicked visitors even tried to scale park fences . Moreno said six people were treated at the scene for assorted minor injuries including bloodied noses , bumps , bruises and scrapes . Two teens , a boy and a girl , were taken to local hospitals by their parents for precautionary evaluation . First we thought it was part of the show but then they told us to run for our lives \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude2d I could n't feel my legs # monsterhigh # greatamerica \u2014 Anarica ( @ Anariica ) October 29 , 2017 When the violence surfaced , four Santa Clara police officers were on hand working private security jobs , and 15 additional Santa Clara officers were called in . An employee working one of the event 's haunted mazes said Saturday night appeared to have attracted unruly elements from the start . \u201c There were an awful lot of morons in the park that night based on who was coming through the maze , \u201d Elizabeth Finkler said . \u201c Then our supervisors told there was a mob going around . She added : \u201c It was just hell on wheels . \u201d \u201c It was terrible , \u201d said a San Francisco mom who had brought her 17- year - old daughter and a friend to the haunt . \u201c A kid in a hoodie ran up and pried the phone out of my hands . \u201d https:\/\/twitter.com\/dancerallim\/status\/924557288035180549 A brief statement from the park 's operator , Cedar Fair Entertainment , did not go into detail about the incident , but said the attacks yielded a swift response . \u201c There were incidents on October 28 at California 's Great America that required assistance from on property Santa Clara police officers and were quickly addressed , \u201d the statement reads . \u201c The safety of our guests is our top priority . \u201d Park officials did not close down the Halloween Haunt , police said . But a source familiar with the park response told this news organization that once the attacks were made known to officials , park lights were turned on and sound was turned down in certain areas of the park , and select attractions were closed . Moreno did not directly dispute the account of the park 's immediate response , but said his officers were at least somewhat hindered by dim conditions . \u201c My understanding is that my officers could have benefited from more light , \u201d he said . Even so , police and park security were outnumbered , visitors reported . The park remained open until its normal 1 a.m. closing time Sunday . Speigel said the events reported at Great America \u201c happen so infrequently \u201d that judging the park 's response is challenging given the lack of available benchmarks . \u201c They 're dealt with throughout the industry on a case - by - case basis . There is n't one rule that says you shut down the whole park , \u201d Speigel said . \u201c You have thousands upon thousands of people who may want to have a good time who may be unaffected by a situation like this . \u201d He added that park operators must prioritize transparency with the public and patrons to maintain its viability as an amusement destination . \u201c In our industry , our parks live on repeat visitation , \u201d Speigel said . Speigel did note that Cedar Fair has a good reputation for responding to unfavorable incidents and spending money to make requisite improvements . \u201c Knowing the Cedar Fair management team , they will take steps to make sure something of this type never happens again , \u201d he said . Sunday was the final day of the Halloween Haunt . No significant bouts of violence or injuries were reported .

There 's a photo of this hybrid in Ellen Velvin 's \" From Jungle To Zoo \" ( 1914 ) captioned \" Two friends ( leopard and dog ) in Carl Hagenbeck 's Zoo . \" A pumapard is the hybrid of a puma and a leopardess . In the late 1890s \/ early 1900s , two hybrids were born in Chicago , followed 2 years later by three sets of twin cubs born at a zoo in Hamburg , Germany from a puma father and leopard mother . Carl Hagenbeck apparently bred several litters of puma x leopard hybrids in 1898 at the suggestion of a menagerie owner in Britain . Hagenbeck had bought a 9 month old female puma-leopard cub from Anderton & Haslam 's menagerie in January 1898 for 26 guineas , along with its parents , a female puma and her male leopard companion , so he is likely to have repeated the mating . HYBRID PUMA AND LEOPARD . ( The Field , 29th June 1895 ) . SIR , I think the following case of hybridism sufficiently interesting to record : In Anderton 's menagerie there is a female puma , but no male . She was put to a large , fine male leopard , and has produced three cubs , two of which died . The third , which I saw , is now a fortnight old . It has a puma 's muzzle ; and the spots , instead of radiating round a yellow ocellus , as in the leopard , are dark solid blotches . Of course this may alter with age . Its fertility , if it lives , of course remains to be proved . - ARCHER VASSALL . Mandeville , Godalming . [ The occurrence of a hybrid between two species of the genus Fells so distinct in colour and locality the puma being American and the leopard from Asia or Africa is exceedingly interesting mad well worthy of record . ED . ] [ HYBRIDS ] The Boston Globe ( Massachusetts ) , 3rd June 1906 , pg 38 Wonder and Land , the hybrid panther and leopard cubs of Feraris wild animal show at Wonderland , are as lively as kittens , and their panther mother fondles her two tiny brown and black offspring with true maternal tenderness . The trio are a sensation of the animal tent and evoke no end of curiosity . CUBS OF LEOPARD FATHER AND PANTHER MOTHER . The Boston Globe ( Massachusetts ) , 1st August 1906 , pg 7 . Only Examples of their Kind in the World Visit the Globe Office Marvel of Animal Experts . Wonder , nine weeks old , described by his keeper as the nastiest animal of his age I ever saw , came to Boston yesterday , snarling , snapping , clawing , spitting and expressing his general objection to everybody and everything he saw . Wonder is an all - round - bad - egg , but he is only a little worse than his partner , Land , who was with him . Wonder and Land are the only living examples of their kind , and so far as is known the only examples there ever were . They are sui generis , and they must have been fully conscious of their exclusiveness in the animal world , for yesterday they clawed red streaks in the hands of Joseph G. Ferari , their guardian , spat and snarled at the photographer who was taking their pictures , tore long rents in the upholstery of the automobile provided for their enjoyment , and were as hard to handle as a whole menagerie of grown ups . Every time they had an audience , which was practically all the time , Wonder and Land seemed to be imbued with this spirit : We are the get of two most treacherous species of the jungle and we have got to live up to the reputation of our parentage . And they did . Wonder and Land were born at Wonderland park , Revere beach , nine weeks ago , and yesterday was their first afternoon away from the maternal side of the South American panther mother who nurses them . They had not seen much of the world up to yesterday afternoon , when Joseph G. Ferari , of Feraris trained wild animal show , and George Dobbins , manager of the Wonderland animal exhibition , bundled them into an automobile and drove them up to the Globe office to have their pictures taken . They did not like anybody or anything . They insisted upon turning their backs to the camera , would not let the artist get a good view of their spiteful countenances , and showed a disposition to fight without provocation . Wonder had the abhorrence of a camera which a society leader assumes , and he made several vicious passes at the instrument while his keeper was trying to get him in presentable position to be taken . Land was a little more tractable , but when the artist had fixed the imprint of the physical proportions of Wonder and Land on his plate Joseph G. Feraris hands needed the attention of a physician , for the sharp claws of the 9-weeks - old had drawn blood from a score of deep rents . The two tawny , spotted animals , who at nine weeks are able to teach a trained keeper caution , are known as panther - hybrids . Nothing like them has ever been born in the world before , and trainer Ferari says he thinks they are in a fair way to make the ugliest and most treacherous beast in or out of captivity . The father of Wonder an Land is an East India leopard , who was captured in the forest when he was about three years old . The mother is a South American panther , who up to the age of two dwelt in the wilds . Through fortune which is to animal trainers incredible , the leopard and the panther bred and the cubs which are the result are the marvel of animal men . In captivity up to this time leopards and panthers have shown the strongest aversion to each other . They would not associate and it was even dangerous to attempt to keep them in one cage . But Mr Ferari succeeded after much trial in finding one of each specie which would mate with the other . These panther - hybrids in the nine weeks they have been on earth have shown , Mr Ferari says , all the vicious characteristics of leopard and panther . As Mr Ferari says , the little fellows at their age ought to be as easy to handle as kittens , since lions , tigers , panthers and other ferocious beasts can be trained without danger , but yesterday he had to be as much on the alert for the sharp claws of the babies as if they were yeas instead of weeks old . They are very interesting curious and they are also very good specimens , strong and vigorous . Both show the panther and leopard blood . The gray in the tawny coat and the spots are from the father , the leopard , while the dark buff of the coat is of the mother . The head and back are those of the panther mother , and the movement , the loping , stealthy stride indicate strongly the predominance of the panther maternal blood . When these kittens are 4 weeks older it will be impossible for us to attempt to touch them with our hands , said Mr Ferari . Never have I seen the vicious element in animals developed so young . What they will be , what characteristics growth will develop we do not know . They are an enigma , a problem . I think they will be an interesting study . After their excursion to town Wonder and Land late in the afternoon were restored to the care of their panther mother at Wonderland park and it was curious to observe the way the panther snarled as she smelled the traces of numerous human hands on the coats of her offspring . Both male puma x female leopard and male leopard x female puma pairings have produced offspring . Hamburg Zoo had a hybrid ( the one in the black and white photo ) fathered by a puma bred to an Indian leopardess . A specimen purchased in 1898 by Berlin Zoo from Carl Hagenbeck was a cross between a male leopard and a female puma ( the same as the Chicago hybrids ) . Various newspapers published this report in early 1903 : The first successful experiment I made was with a leopard and a puma , \" said Mr. Hagenbeck recently . And the only living animal of the litter I sold some time ago to the Berlin Zoological Garden , where it Is still in the collection . In The Field No 2887 , April 25th , 1908 , Henry Scherren wrote \" Writing in Zoologischer Garten ( 1903 , pp. 288-90 ) , Forstmeister Adolf Rorig , of Frankfort - on - the - Main , gave a summary of the notices of feline hybrids that had previously appeared in that journal . There was , and probably is now , in the Berlin Garden and Indian leopard and puma male hybrid , purchased of Carl Hagenbeck in 1898 . In his Guide Dr Heck described it as a little grey puma with large brown rosettes . Another hybrid between the same species , but with a puma for sire and a leopard from dam , was recently at Stellingen ; it resembled the female parent in form , as may be seen from the reproduction from a photograph taken there . \" Hagenbeck much later wrote ( 1951 ) that a male puma and female leopard produced a hybrid cub that was reared by a Fox terrier bitch ( this was common practice to ensure a tamed individual ) at Hagenbeck Tierpark , Hamburg . The hybrid was male and intermediate between the puma and leopard in colour and pattern , having faint leopard spots on a puma-coloured background . The body length was much less than either parent and the tail was long , like the puma . A pair of leopard x puma hybrid cubs were born in Chicago on 24 April 1896 at Tattersalls indoor arena where Ringling Brothers Circus opened its season . Details about the two cubs were published in The Chicago Chronicle on 25th April 1896 : Two tiny cubs which look like young leopards were born at Tattersall 's where Ringling Brothers circus is housed , yesterday ( 24 APR [ 18 ] 96 ) . They are not leopards , however . Their mother is a mountain lion or cougar and their father is a leopard . They take after their father decidedly , and are the daintiest little members of the cat family ever born in captivity . In fact they are the only ones of their kind , so far as known , ever born , either within the confines of a cage or anywhere else . These black and yellow youngsters were on exhibition yesterday and were admired by all who saw them . They will probably be on view the rest of the time the circus exhibits in <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [\"the late 1890s \/ early 1900s\", \"1898\", \"24 April 1896\"], \"Place\": [\"Chicago\", \"Hamburg , Germany\"], \"Agent\": [\"Carl Hagenbeck\"], \"Goal\": [\"A pair of leopard x puma hybrid cubs\"]}"}

Although he was directed in Dante 's portrayal , Langdon was confused by staff <event> suggestions <\/event> and played his own version of the character . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Demon Hunters just do n't get any cooler than Devil May Cry 's Dante . TGL had the honour of catching up with the man behind the voice and moves of everyone 's favourite white haired ebony and ivory wielding demon slayer , Reuben Langdon . We spoke to Reuben about how he got started in the industry , his production company , his work on James Cameron 's Avatar , how he landed the role of Dante and his take on the forthcoming DMC reboot . Fingers on your devil trigger folks . Let 's rock , baby \u2026.. TGL : Hi Reuben . It 's a pleasure to finally speak with you . How are you doing today ? Reuben Langdon : I 'm great thanks . It 's great to finally speak with you guys . TGL : Why do n't you start off by telling us how you started out in the industry ? EB : Sure . Well , I guess if I 'm going to mention how I got to where I am today , I should trace it back to when I actually did some work as a model . At the start I was n't so sure about acting or the modelling thing but after a couple of attempts and realising that it was n't going to be as bad as I thought it was going to be , I started to make some decent side money and from there that led to an interest in acting and taking acting classes in Japan in Japanese . Then I landed a role on a TV show called B- Fighter Kabuto . That 's where it all started for me in terms of knowing what I wanted to do . I wanted to do action and acting and stunts . That show was kind of like a Power Ranger - esque show . I landed that role and appeared on that show as a regular for about a half a year . Since then I 've been very much involved in the business . It has its ups and downs but I would say that in the last 10 years I 've really been focused on my company \u201c Just Cause \u201d where we are doing bigger and better things every year . The main goal of the company is to produce films and videogame content . TGL : Did \u201c Just Cause \u201d start out as a company that just worked on film and did you just find yourself dabbling more and more in the realm of games ? RL : When I started the company with my partner , Takuya Shibata , who is based in Japan , our goal and our intent was to create our own content and produce our own content . The idea at the start was that it would be mostly for film . Because of my experience doing acting shows and what not , I had worked on Resident Evil : Code Veronica doing motion capture and during that experience I was the only white guy on the cast and they had both a Japanese and English script . The way they had been doing motion capture up to that point was that they would usually have Japanese actors act out everything and then they would go in and localise it with English because they knew the ultimate final project was going to be in English . They asked me to do my part in English but it was awkward for them to ask the Japanese actors to act out in English . It was what I call the \u201c Gun Head \u201d effect . It 's like an old 80\/90s Japanese film based on the manga where the lead heroine is speaking English and then there are a couple of actors who perform their dialogue in English but then the rest of the actors were speaking in Japanese and it was just weird . So when I was doing Code Veronica , I felt that weirdness . It did n't feel right . There had to be a better way . So a few years later , me and my partner formed the company and we were basically just looking for projects . We needed to get some experience under our belts and get or company off the ground . So we came up with a proposal to basically coordinate between the two of us and we started working on Power Rangers in the States . We wanted to audition talent in the States , cast them and then fly them over to Japan to do the motion capture . We thought it was n't going to be that big of a deal . Our company would help get the scripts and help localise them and take care of those aspects . We first started off with Resident Evil Outbreak . And then Devil May Cry came on board . Capcom were very happy with the results from our Resident Evil stuff . They decided to hand everything over to us for Devil May Cry and handle the script localisation and getting the talent . We actually recommended the director too . So that 's kind of what got our company started on the games side . We wanted to work on any kind of story telling media and the game thing just sort of kicked off around this time with Capcom . We work with Capcom pretty regularly . We have a very good relationship with them . TGL : Sounds like \u201c Just Cause \u201d is quite a layered service \u2026 RL : Yes it is but I do have to audition for parts in games even if my company is involved like with Chris Redfield or Dante . Actually I had to audition for Dante both times , both for Devil May Cry 3 and Devil May Cry 4 and both times for the voice too . I do both the voice and mo-cap for Dante and just the mo-cap for Chris . I actually auditioned four times for Dante , more if you count call - backs . It 's kind of like a double sided sword with Capcom . It 's great because these projects are coming in the door to my company but then I still have to go through all the motions and hoops and huddles on the auditioning side . Sometimes even more than the other actors because Capcom know I 'm the owner of the company and think \u201c how can he act ? \u201d I 've decided now though that I wo n't be auditioning for any more roles that come through my company , unless it 's a reoccurring role , because it can be too much of a headache on the producer side and the actor side . I 'm separating my careers a little bit more . TGL : But before we talk about games and the parts you 've played in more detail , not many people probably know this but you were significantly involved in James Cameron 's Avatar , were n't you ? You did the mo-cap for Jake Sully . That 's amazing . Congratulations . RL : Thank you . That was an amazing project and I would have to say that its probably one of the , if not the , best project I 've ever worked on . And knock on wood ; I hope I 'll be coming back for Avatar 2 and 3 . Basically I had heard about the project because originally it was going to be Battle Angel . I had done some testing for Battle Angel at House of Moves which is one of the more prestige mo-cap studios here in L.A. Cameron did n't actually make it to any of those tests but some of the other key technical people were there . So I did the test and Battle Angel which for me was my dream project . I 'm a huge Battle Angel fan . I really had to get on this project especially when I heard that Cameron had the rights to the franchise . After I did that test I did n't hear anything . At this time mo-cap in movies was still pretty new . This was about 2005 - 2006 . A friend of mine who was on the project was always submitting my name because I was known for my mo-cap . There were only a couple of Mo-cap films out there at that time like Beowulf and Polar Express . So anyway , I had heard nothing and then all of a sudden I got a call asking me to fill in for a friend on the set . We were the same height so that helped and there I was on the set of Avatar , not Battle Angel . It was cool . Jim seemed to like what I was doing and they kept asking me back and it was on and off for about three years . It 's a super honour to have been a part of it . I 'm really crossing my fingers that I get invited back for the next two movies . Thank you for mentioning Avatar because I find that usually when I go to conventions and if I mention Avatar then people usually start falling asleep . I 'm like \u201c you do n't have any Avatar questions ? It was the highest grossing film of all time ! \u201d But that 's ok . People usually just want to talk about games , which is cool . TGL : So can I ask you about games and your involvement in Devil May Cry ? You are Dante after all . Did you have any idea when you got involved just how big the DMC franchise actually was ? RL : I had played the first DMC . I guess I did n't know it had such a cult following at that stage . I did n't really realise until after we had done the capture and the first trailer came out . It was then that I started to get a lot of hate mail from fans telling me that I was n't Dante and that the voice was different and I was n't the right character anymore . It was only then that I realised that WOW there 's a huge fan base for this . From the DMC 3 trailer that the fans saw at this time , they were not happy with the change and Dante 's new look . I would definitely say that there were more negative emails and negative posts about it on blogs and stuff . But then the game came out and everybody loved it . Then all of a sudden I 'm Dante and everybody forgot about the other guy so it 's cool now . TGL : So what do you make of the new revised Ninja- Theory DMC ? RL : With regards to the new one , I do n't have any part in it , I have n't been asked and I do believe that 's it probably too late in the game for me to come on board , even if they did ask me to voice or do any motion capture or anything like that . I believe that it 's a whole other different take on the character and casting and everything else just like 3 . I 'm not involved so I ca n't say much but because I was involved in 3 and 4 I do know the history and that 3 was a reboot of the series . The new game is that as well . It may be a little more extreme or maybe not . I think people at the time when 3 came out were afraid of the changes and it proved to work in the end . What I would say about the new one is that maybe history might repeat itself . TGL : A lot of fans are quite concerned with what they 've seen of the new game so far . RL : Yeah , I 've been getting a lot of Facebook messages and emails about it and yes , I suppose I 'm not that much of a fan of the direction it is going but also that 's the feeling a lot of Devil May Cry 1 fans had going into Devil May Cry 3 . We wo n't mention Devil May Cry 2 , Capcom do n't like to talk about it that much ! TGL : For obvious reasons \u2026 RL : Yeah , I think we 'll skip over that one . But looking back , who knows ? This could be something very different and revolutionary . TGL : We should just put our faith in Capcom and Ninja - Theory \u2026 RL : Yes . I know that Ninja - Theory are doing the bulk of the work but I was talking to Hideaki Itsuno who was the director on DMC 2 , 3 and 4 and he has been taking lots <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Salient_entity\": [], \"Time\": [], \"Addressee\": [\"Reuben Langdon\"], \"Topic\": [\"that newer Dante\"], \"Medium\": [\"notes\"], \"Speaker\": [\"everybody\"], \"Place\": [\"my first motion capture scene\"], \"Content\": [\"Do this\", \"do that\", \"too much of this\", \"do this more\"]}"}

Almost 10 million people \u2013 about 20 % of the adult population \u2013 follow the sport . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> November 2017 , London . At a secret meeting in an undisclosed location , Tom Harrison , chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board , the sport 's national governing body , is being run through a slideshow presentation on the future of the game . English cricket is sleepwalking through a demographic crisis , he is told . In the UK , the sport retains a mainly white , affluent , middle - aged - male audience . Beyond this privileged set , the appeal fades . The findings are from four years of surveys , taking in the responses of more than 100,000 people on their attitudes towards cricket . Of the 10.5 million \u201c followers \u201d interested in the sport , 1.1 million actually attend matches . The amount of people playing the game is falling . Only 5 per cent of children aged between seven and 15 years old list cricket in their top two favourite sports . The average age of an English cricket fan is 50 . Harrison , a white , affluent , privately educated 47 - year - old already knows this . The research has been circulating within the ECB for months . To his surprise , the last slide proposes a solution : The Hundred , a tournament in which each innings lasts just 100 balls , creating a faster , simpler , more accessible version of the game . \u201c My instantaneous reaction was : I love it , \u201d recalls Harrison when I meet him at the ECB 's offices at Lord 's , the famous London ground that is known as \u201c the home of cricket \u201d . \u201c I absolutely love it . I can actually feel the hairs on my neck just thinking about that moment , that sense of , ' Wow , this is powerful . ' \u201d Then he adds : \u201c Very quickly afterwards [ there was ] a kind of dose of reality . This is n't going to be straightforward . \u201d The Hundred may not sound like a revolution . Last year , the ECB invited an elite group of coaches and players to a two -day workshop to brainstorm innovations , from increasing the size of teams to even , for a few seconds , eliminating the \u201c leg before wicket \u201d rule . Most were not taken up , though some , such as strategic \u201c time-outs \u201d , were . But when it launches in July next year , the game will still feature bat v ball , a duel of willow against leather over 22 yards on a grass pitch . Beneath the surface , though , lies a more subversive design . Millennial audiences have ever-narrowing attention spans , but have ever-greater ways to be entertained . Cricket is not alone in responding to this challenge . The ATP , the body that runs men 's professional tennis , has launched a tournament dedicated to experiments such as using a \u201c shot -clock \u201d to limit the time a player has before serving . In the US , American football , basketball and baseball have all introduced rule changes to speed up the pace of play . The ECB 's plan goes a lot further . It is spending \u00a3 180 m to create new teams featuring the country 's best players , right in the heart of the summer cricket season . English cricket is making an all - in bet on an untested proposition . The sport has accepted the need for speed . This summer will feature The Ashes , a Test series between Australia and England that first took place in 1877 , featuring matches that last up to five days , yet can still end in a draw . But later this month also marks the start of the cricket World Cup in England , where games are crunched into a single day . Last week saw the conclusion of the Indian Premier League , a money -spinning competition launched in 2008 , featuring \u201c Twenty20 \u201d matches that last just a few hours . The Hundred slims cricket down even further . Some argue this is unnecessary and may even harm the game . One top English cricket executive , who declines to be named fearing the wrath of the ECB , says it is like inventing Gaelic football , a game beloved in Ireland , but incomprehensible outside those shores . \u201c To add a fourth format that wo n't be played anywhere else , that has no international relevance , is a real dichotomy for the game , \u201d the executive says . In nondescript offices overlooking the lush , green practice pitches of Lord 's , I meet the team of officials reimagining an ancient game . Over several hours of interviews , they provide the deepest insight yet into the project , though much remains shrouded in secrecy . Their work has led to a fierce debate raging across the game . Is The Hundred a necessary and vital departure , pointing to a brighter future for other sports ? Or an expensive and foolhardy attempt to reach the masses , while alienating cricket 's loyal fan base ? The man who pitched The Hundred to Harrison is a Scot. Sanjay Patel was brought up in the small town of Alloa and played for Scotland 's national cricket team . He spent several years as an executive in the drinks industry before joining the ECB in 2014 . In February , the 46- year - old became managing director of The Hundred , tasked with bringing the new tournament to life . According to Patel , The Hundred is a silver bullet to solve a trio of problems . First , time . Even the shortest form of the game , Twenty 20 matches ( in which each innings lasts 120 balls in total ) , lasts three to four hours , much longer than comparable events , such as a football match . Second , complexity . In cricket 's Byzantine scoring system , newcomers must follow runs scored , overs bowled , wickets taken , among myriad other statistics . Third , perception . Too few outside cricket 's establishment see it as a game for them . The Hundred addresses each of these issues , says Patel . Games will be completed within two and a half hours . And spectators can track a game through a countdown of balls and accumulation of runs . \u201c We felt when cricket was at its best , it was really simple , \u201d he says . \u201c There 's 30 runs required and there 's 15 balls left . That 's when cricket becomes so accessible to a wider audience . \u201d The Hundred 's main method for dealing with the game 's \u201c stale , male , pale \u201d conundrum is to break with almost 130 years of tradition . In English county cricket , competitions feature 18 \u201c first class \u201d counties , representing historic geographic districts around the country \u2014 from Durham in the north to Sussex in the south . Instead , The Hundred will involve eight new city - based franchises in Birmingham , Cardiff , Leeds , Manchester , Nottingham , Southampton and London ( one at the Oval and one at Lord's ) . The ECB says its shift is justified by research , which shows that the growing urbanisation of modern Britain means people now associate more closely with cities than with the \u201c shires \u201d . Still , in order to convince existing counties to accept being swallowed up by metropolises , Harrison , alongside ECB chairman Colin Graves ( one of the few ECB executives not made available for interview ) pledged to give each county \u00a3 1.3 m from the proceeds of the new competition as an incentive to vote in favour of creating it . For most , the cash will be the difference between making a profit or loss . Little is known about the new franchises . A year out from the start of the tournament , teams do not have fixed staff , players , names , branding , jerseys or colours . Rob Caulder , the ECB 's commercial director , another Scot though one with a predilection for management speak , pleads for patience . \u201c We spoke to people inside cities [ to understand ] what were the different aspects of identity in each , \u201d he says . And what did he find ? Caulder stiffens . Only when pushed , does he provide the vaguest of insights . This includes that Mancunians are proud of their city as a home to renowned sports teams and music acts . How such information will be used to guide the creation of new franchises is , for now , anyone 's guess . Last month , ECB officials travelled far from cricket 's heartlands to Nashville , Tennessee . They were there to watch the annual \u201c Draft \u201d for the National Football League , in which 32 NFL franchises select from the best young prospects in American football . The drama is played out live on television , as expectant fans wait to see who will join their side . The trip was a reconnaissance mission . In October , the ECB will hold a player draft for The Hundred . It too will be televised live and act as a coming - out party for the tournament . \u201c It creates a bit of excitement , \u201d says Patel . \u201c A bit of noise . \u201d In the draft , team bosses will select from the 400 professional male cricketers in England and Wales , as well as scores of overseas internationals . Each team in The Hundred will have a squad of 15 players , with three places reserved for prestige foreign signings . Reports suggest players will be paid anything between \u00a3 25,000 and \u00a3 120,000 . At the top end , these salaries are higher than most cricketers earn for an entire season \u2014 though the very best are paid hundreds of thousands of pounds for participating in India 's IPL tournament . Choosing players in this way represents another break with the county game . Joe Root , current England Test captain , is a proud Yorkshireman who has represented his home county since the start of his career . What if he fails to be selected by the Leeds franchise that will play at Yorkshire 's home ground of Headingley ? How will fans react if Root 's prized batting is secured by an outfit based hundreds of miles away in Cardiff or Southampton ? The ECB believes enough fans will embrace a change of allegiances while Harrison insists the best players in the world will feature in The Hundred . However , Virat Kohli , the Indian captain who is cricket 's brightest superstar , has declared no interest in playing . Besides , the BCCI , the body that runs Indian cricket , does not allow male Indian players in the IPL to participate in rival global contests . This will limit interest for the tournament in the world 's biggest cricket market , which comprises hundreds of millions of avid viewers . Can The Hundred become a truly international tournament ? Harrison is talking to BCCI about relaxing its policies . \u201c I promise you one thing , 100 balls has got the attention of the powers - that - be in India in a way that perhaps we have n't managed to in the past . It 's a sign that we 're really thinking differently and thinking probably in a much broader sense about how we grow the game , \u201d he says . The plan in the meantime ? Build it and they will come . At Lord 's in 2017 , a sold - out crowd of 26,500 watched England 's female cricketers manage something their male counterparts have failed to do : win the coveted World Cup . Clare Connor , a former England women 's captain and now the ECB 's managing director of women 's cricket , noticed a few other firsts that day . Queues for the women 's toilets were longer than those for the men's . Lines to buy coffee were as long as those for the bar . There is a belief at the ECB that more diverse crowds can also be attracted for The Hundred , with each franchise fielding men 's and women 's sides . Equal billing does not mean equal pay . There will be no draft of women , with the best paid receiving , at most , \u00a3 15,000 , according to Connor . There are only 21 full -time , professional female cricketers in the country , though the ECB says the \u201c aspiration \u201d is to create a further 80 to 100 semi-professional players next year . In the bigger picture , however , The Hundred is seen as a way of moving the women 's game towards parity in more ways than pay . \u201c One story that I heard after the women 's World Cup final : a friend took his son and daughter , \u201d says Connor . \u201c His son said afterwards : ' Daddy , my new favourite player is [ England bowler ] Anya Shrubsole .

His campaigning attracted significant media <event> attention <\/event> and as a result he was one of the most high - profile backbench MPs . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Simon Danczuk , the Labour MP for Rochdale , has been censured by the parliamentary authorities for late declarations of almost \u00a3 20,000 in payments \u2013 the bulk of which are from his book exposing his Liberal predecessor Cyril Smith . The MP , who has become a darling of the rightwing press for his campaign about an establishment cover - up of sexual abuse , has been found to be in serious breach of Commons procedures because he repeatedly failed to register monies on time \u2013 including more than \u00a3 12,000 for excerpts from his book , Smile for the Camera , which appeared in the Daily Mail . While Danczuk was cleared of any intention to conceal the cash and argued that a loss of office staff had meant systems were not in place to register his interests in time , MPs on the parliamentary committee that considers complaints said he would have to report back in October 2015 to prove that he will conform to the procedures of the house . Kathryn Hudson , the parliamentary commissioner for standards , said that while MPs had 28 days to register interests and 15 % of payments for employment for which dates were given were registered late , Danczuk 's behaviour had been unacceptable . Hudson said : \u201c At the time when the complaint was made Mr Danczuk had registered one item in the first seven months of the year . During the course of my inquiries he has registered a further 22 items , 13 of which were late . Mr Danczuk has made six late registrations since I drew this matter to his attention , two of these more than a month late . The total amount of money involved was \u00a3 19,894 . Repeated failures to make timely registrations add up to a serious matter . \u201d Danczuk is one of the most high - profile backbenchers , with regular appearances on television and in the newspapers \u2013 something which has made matters worse . \u201c This situation was then exacerbated by an increase in the number of registrations required as a result of the high profile he has acquired in the last year \u2026 as yet I have no evidence that Mr Danczuk has put in place any administrative system which will ensure that it does not [ continue ] . \u201d She went on to question whether Matt Baker , the MP 's assistant who co-wrote Danczuk 's book , should have also registered payments he received as he had a Commons pass , even though he was in based in the constituency . Hudson said : \u201c The payments have not been registered . I have therefore asked the registrar to inquire whether the staff member had considered registering this payment and to report the outcome to me . \u201d When contacted by the Guardian , Danczuk said he accepted the committee 's verdict . \u201c It was down to poor administration in my office and a change of personnel , \u201d he said . \u201c This meant I did not make timely registration . I have learnt a lesson in this and I will be more rigorous in the future . I will also be talking to Matt [ Baker ] about how to register his interests . \u201d Baker said he had \u201c spoken to the [ authorities ] and I have not broken any rules as I have not been advantaged in any way by being a pass holder \u201d . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Expressor\": [], \"Perceiver\": [\"the rightwing press\"], \"Figure\": [\"for his campaign about an establishment cover - up of sexual abuse\"]}"}

However he was criticised for corruption and <event> avoidance <\/event> of EU law in his home state . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Patronage at Home The Cronyism of Germany 's European Commission Candidate Oettinger Only recently G\u00fcnther Oettinger was more than willing to explain why he should serve on next European Commission . The governor of Baden - W\u00fcrttemberg , 56 , pointed out his expertise on the economy and industry . He claimed that -- in addition to his perfect German -- he had a \" basic \" knowledge of Italian , understood French \" very well , \" and was \" certainly capable of negotiating \" in English . Finally , in a comment directed at the European Parliament , meant to demonstrate his purity of purpose , he said : \" I intend to and will make every effort to ensure that EU regulations are correctly implemented in the member states . \" That sentence , however it 's interpreted , will be a problem for Oettinger . At home in his southwestern German state of Baden - W\u00fcrttemberg , Oettinger does precisely the opposite with EU regulations . Various documents suggest that he has , in fact , participated in an audacious effort to circumvent European rules on the awarding of contracts , ignored national competition law and violated an obligation to act in an economically and fiscally responsible way . The controversy involves two hydraulic engineering projects on the Upper Rhine , which are being sponsored jointly by the federal government and the state of Baden -W\u00fcrttemberg . These projects are only two of the many major public works projects that are unspectacular enough to avoid mention on the evening news . But they 're the sort of projects that lend themselves to lobbying , patronage and backroom deals . Gravel and Graft The projects appeared legitimate in the fall of 2007 , when details were ironed out by the federal transportation ministry , the government headquarters in Freiburg and the state ministries of the environment , transportation and finance . The issue was flood controle : To protect 700,000 residents of the southern Baden region who live along the Rhine between the towns of Weil and Breisach , an overflow reservoir with capacity for 25 million cubic meters of water was planned . This will require the excavation of 55 million tons of gravel . That 's one project . The other requires a mixture of sand and gravel to be deposited periodically on the riverbed 150 kilometers ( 94 miles ) downriver , near the town of Iffezheim , to combat erosion . Experts at the relevant state and federal agencies concluded that combining the projects made sense . Half of the 55 million tons of excavated gravel were to be stored temporarily in a flooded gravel pit near Iffezheim , then dumped into the Rhine over the next few decades . Suddenly , though , the state finance ministry in Stuttgart balked . It decided to block a cabinet decision needed to approve the administrative agreement that would allow the projects to proceed . According to an internal memo , finance officials had voiced \" concerns regarding the cost-effectiveness of the approach to be taken . \" To address these concerns , the officials favored a \" proposal offered by KVG . \" KVG is the German acronym for \" Gravel Bidding and Exploitation Company of the Southern Upper Rhine Region , \" a consortium of gravel and road construction companies . Under the KVG proposal , all the excavated gravel would be sold on the market in return for KVG 's commitment to provide all the gravel needed to shore up the riverbed near Iffezheim for the next 80 years . The deal would be worth millions to KVG . ' Unacceptable ' As it happens , there is a strong connection between KVG and the conservative Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) , G\u00fcnther Oettinger 's party . Most of the KVG companies are located in the election districts of state Finance Minister Willi St\u00e4chele and his state secretary , Gundolf Fleischer . Three KVG companies donated \u20ac 10,500 each to the Christian Democrats during the state 's 2006 election . Hermann Peter KG Baustoffwerke , a company headquartered in the town of Breisach , also donated \u20ac 10,500 to the party , while the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg industrial association of stone and earth excavators contributed \u20ac 10,180 . Upon closer scrutiny , though , the KVG proposal favored by St\u00e4chele and Fleischer proved less than cost-effective . According to experts it would cost the state at least \u20ac 65 million and the federal government \u20ac 155 million more than the first plan to combine the projects -- for a total incremental cost to taxpayers of \u20ac 220 million . Even Fleischer 's counterparts at the state ministries of Transportation and the Environment voiced concerns . They said a call for bids was essential to satisfy the requirements of competition law : \" Awarding the contract directly to KVG would be out of the question , and it would also constitute a violation of EU subsidy and budget regulations . \" Besides , they added , a commitment to an 80 - year contract would be \" unacceptable . \" Despite this assessment , St\u00e4chele , Fleischer and Oettinger persevered with efforts to block the plan for more than two years . They failed to respond to admonishing letters from Berlin -- last September the Federal Transportation Minister at the time , Wolfgang Tiefensee , personally complained to Oettinger in a sharply worded letter last September . It took two months for Oettinger 's Minister of Federal and European Affairs to answer Tiefensee 's letter . The existing economic efficiency report , he wrote to the new Federal Transportation Minister Peter Ramsauer , had been forwarded to the state audit office \" with the objective of obtaining an advisory statement . \" As soon as the results became available , he added , the state would \" promptly contact the Federal Transportation Ministry . \" The outgoing Transportation Minister , Tiefensee , had been a Social Democrat -- a political opponent -- while the new one , Ramsauer , a member of the Christian Social Union , the Bavarian sister party to the CDU , was an ally . It may have been a disappointment for Oettinger that a fellow conservative was not more cooperative . But Ramsauer believes that Oettinger 's efforts to obstruct the administrative agreement in Baden - W\u00fcrttemberg are \" unjustified . \" He cites a conclusion reached by the Federal Audit Office , which examined -- and approved -- the model of combining both gravel projects , devised by state and federal agencies . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Agent\": [\"G\\u00fcnther Oettinger\"], \"Place\": [\"Baden - W\\u00fcrttemberg\"], \"Undesirable_situation\": [\"to circumvent European rules on the awarding of contracts\"], \"Time\": [\"more than two years\"]}"}

Billy R. Turner , 46 , was charged with first-degree murder . According to a document , he was indicted Tuesday . The Multi Agency Gang Unit saw him leave a house in the 4700 block of Waterfront Oak Drive , get into a vehicle and travel to the Collierville Express Mart on U.S. 72 . He was then arrested and was being held on $ 1 million bond . \u25ba Update : Lorenzen Wright 's ex-wife Sherra arrested in connection with his death \u25ba More : ' Finally Justice for Lorenzen Wright ' : How social media reacted to news of arrest \" The Lorenzen Wright case has stayed in the public eye for many years , \" Memphis police Director Michael Rallings said . \" We said many times that we had never stopped investigating . \" Turner is to be arraigned Thursday in Shelby County Criminal Court Division 7 in Judge Lee Coffee 's court . Deborah Marion , Wright 's mother , expressed relief over Tuesday 's developments , saying authorities confirmed Turner 's arrest shortly before a mid-afternoon news conference . \" I 'm ecstatic . I 'm full of flame , \" Marion said , later adding : \u201c We got the main player . \u201d According to Shelby County court records , Turner has an arrest record dating to 1992 . \u25ba Get more from The Commercial Appeal : On Twitter | On Facebook | Subscribe In August 1992 , Turner pleaded guilty to reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon . He was sentenced to two years in the Shelby County Correction Center , according to court records .

No cigarettes , no beer , no lottery tickets , \u201d Alaina said . \u201c We 're always laughing together . He 's a nice guy . \" Alaina was n't at the store Tuesday morning when Turner was apprehended but knew immediately who Turner was after seeing the surveillance video of the arrest . Turner owns a landscape business and usually had a trailer loaded with equipment , he said . \u201c I 'm in disbelief , \" Alaina said . \u25ba More : Lorenzen Wright 's killing and Billy Turner 's arrest : What we know No one answered a phone associated with Turner on Tuesday afternoon . Marion said she considered a lot of possible suspects in the years since her son 's death , but she \u201c never , never , never \u201d heard of Turner . Authorities confirmed last month they had found a gun believed to have been used in Wright 's killing in a lake in the Walnut , Mississippi , area . That discovery prompted officials to publicize a $ 21,000 reward for information established in the case years earlier . Wright stood 6 - foot - 11 and was a star player for the University of Memphis . He went on to play for several NBA teams including the Los Angeles Clippers and Memphis Grizzlies . He went through personal and financial setbacks , including a divorce and the foreclosure of two homes . He finished his NBA career in 2009 and was killed at age 34 . Wright had been living in Atlanta and was visiting the Memphis area when he disappeared in July 2010 . Wright 's ex-wife , Sherra Robinson Wright , had told authorities in 2010 that he left her Collierville home at about 10:30 p.m. July 18 with drugs and an unspecified amount of money , according to a Memphis police affidavit . She told authorities that Wright made a phone call to an unknown person and said he was going to flip something for $ 110,000 . He then left in a vehicle driven by an unidentified person shortly after the call , she said . Wright appears to have called 911 from his cellphone from a field near the TPC Southwind golf course minutes after midnight on July 19 , 2010 . His body was found in the area several days later , and authorities have said it was so badly decomposed that it was unclear how many times he was shot . Shell casings from different caliber weapons were found at the crime scene . \u25ba Crime : First unsolved murder in Memphis nearly 100 years old Thousands of people attended Wright 's funeral at FedExForum . Speakers included then - Memphis Mayor A C Wharton . \" He was a young man who never forgot who he was , where he came from , the values that shaped him and the people who encouraged him along the way , \" Wharton said at the time . \" Lorenzen 's story was one of those special Memphis stories where a man is able to transcend his roots even while he represents those roots proudly . \" By December 2010 , hope of a quick resolution to the case had faded . Authorities said that only 22 tips had come in , and Crime Stoppers Executive Director Buddy Chapman said at the time that they were n't substantive . It became one of the highest - profile unsolved killings in the city 's recent history . On West South Street in Collierville , neighbors said Turner stayed there with a relative . They could n't believe that the man they 've known for years has been arrested for murder . \u201c I could n't believe it when I heard it . He seems to be a nice person , \u201d said Terrance Jones as he walked on his way to work past the small blue frame house where Turner stays . It was the same for a group of men who were across the street working on a car . \u201c I do n't believe he did it , \u201d said Walter Jordan , who has known Turner all his life . \u201c l never would believe he did no stuff like that . ... Because he 's a really nice person . He 's helped me whenever I needed it . \u201d Turner helped him when Jordan 's truck stopped running , he said , and Turner helped others in the neighborhood with their cars and with work around their homes , as well . \u201c I do n't think he did it . Somebody framed him probably , \u201d Jordan said . Mose Stokes has known Turner for decades as well and agrees . \u201c He ai n't that kind of person . He 's a good man , \" Stokes said . At a press conference , Rallings gave a reminder about other Memphis cases that are unsolved . \u201c We just want to remind everyone that we need citizens to come forward , \u201d Rallings said . Rallings declined to give information about the relationship between Turner and Wright , or any information about motive . He would also not say if there are other suspects in the Wright case . \u201c We 'll continue and we 'll just go wherever the investigation leads us , \u201d he said . \" We 're just going to sit around for the next couple of weeks and see what happens , \u201d Marion said .

Proceedings from a panel of Jamestown 's 2008 December terrorism conference entitled The Expanding Geography of Militant Jihad . The Who 's Who of the Somali Insurgency is an essential reference guide to the disparate forces and individuals seeking to split , conquer or unify this long troubled nation in the strategic Horn of Africa region . Militants operating in Pakistans North - West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) include both Taliban and non-Taliban forces . However , the Taliban militants are much larger in number and have a lot more influence in the region . The Pakistani Taliban have close links with the Afghan Taliban and operate on both sides of the Pakistan - Afghanistan border , also known as the Durand Line after the British diplomat who demarcated the boundary in 1893 , Sir Mortimer Durand . The non- Taliban militants , on the other hand , are often pro-government and enjoy cordial ties with the Pakistan authorities and security forces . The Tehrik- i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) of North and South Waziristan Most of the Pakistani Taliban militants are grouped in an umbrella organization , the Tehrik - i-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) . The movement was launched on December 13 , 2007 , in a secret meeting of senior Taliban commanders hailing from the South Waziristan , North Waziristan , Orakzai , Kurram , Khyber , Mohmand , Bajaur and Darra Adamkhel tribal regions and the districts of Swat , Buner , Upper Dir , Lower Dir , Bannu , Lakki Marwat , Tank , Peshawar , Dera Ismail Khan , Mardan and Kohat ( The News International [ Islamabad ] , December 15 , 2007 ) . According to TTP deputy leader Maulana Faqir Mohammad and other senior commanders , the militants formed the organization to pool the resources and manpower of Pakistans Taliban to fight in self - defense if the security forces of Pakistan attacked their areas and also to extend help to the Afghan Taliban taking part in the jihad , or holy war , against U.S. and International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) troops in neighboring Afghanistan ( Newsline.com.pk [ Karachi ] , July 2008 ; The News International , July 29 , 2007 ) . Due to the military operations undertaken by Pakistans armed forces against them , the Pakistani Taliban now have a fight at home and are therefore unable to send many fighters to Afghanistan to fight alongside the Afghan Taliban . The TTP is headed by Baitullah Mahsud , based in South Waziristan and currently the most powerful Pakistani Taliban commander . In his late 30s , Mahsud is referred to as the Amir Sahib by his followers . Like many other Pakistanis , he began fighting as a young man during the Afghan jihad against the Soviet occupation force in Afghanistan and later joined the Afghan Taliban . Presently , he is stated to be ill , suffering from kidney and heart diseases due to complications arising from diabetes . He reportedly named three of his commanders to run the TTP on his behalf , including Waliur Rahman who has been negotiating with the tribal jirgas , or councils , created by the Pakistan government ( The News International , August 24 ) . The TTP is not a disciplined organization as two fairly recent events showed . First was the refusal of some components of the TTP to accept Hafiz Gul Bahadur , the Pakistani Taliban commander from North Waziristan , as deputy leader of the Baitullah Mahsud - led organization . Later in the winter of 2007 - 2008 , Hafiz Gul Bahadur did not cooperate with Baitullah Mahsud when the latter was under attack from Pakistan Army . In fact , Bahadur warned Baitullah Mahsud against firing rockets at Pakistani forces camps in Razmak , which is located in North Waziristan . His plea was that he and his followers had signed a peace accord with Pakistan government in North Waziristan and therefore no action should be taken against the Pakistani security forces there as it would amount to violation of the agreement ( see Terrorism Monitor , February 7 ) . In simple terms , he refused to become involved in the fighting that was then taking place between Baitullah Mahsuds Taliban and Pakistan Army in neighboring South Waziristan ( Newsline.com.pk , July 2008 ) Opposition to Baitullah Mahsud Hafiz Gul Bahadur is now head of an emerging group of Pakistani Taliban commanders opposed to Baitullah Mahsud . The yet - to - be-named group also includes Maulvi Nazeer , the Taliban commander for Wana area in South Waziristan , and Haji Namdar Khan , the head of the Amr Bil Maruf Wa Nahi Anil Munkar ( Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice ) group of militants operating in the Bara area of Khyber Agency . Namdar Khan was recently killed in Bara by a young man who was allegedly sent by Baitullah Mahsuds group to eliminate him ( The Nation [ Islamabad ] , August 14 ) . This was the second attempt on his life . The earlier attack was a suicide bombing targeting him some months ago , but he survived . Several of his men along with seminary students were killed in the earlier attack which took place inside an Islamic school in Bara . In the second instance of TTP indiscipline , the TTP failed to take action against the Pakistani Taliban commander Omar Khalid ( whose real name is Abdul Wali ) , in Mohmand Agency even though Baitullah Mahsud had sent a commission to investigate charges against him . In fact , TTP spokesman Maulvi Omar had publicly stated that Omar Khalid would be punished for attacking a rival group of Islamic fighters that had a training camp in Mohmand Agency . Omar Khalids men killed the groups commander Shah Khalid and his deputy Obaidullah , along with several other fighters and captured more than 70 ( Dawn [ Karachi ] , July 20 ) . The detained men , all belonging to the so-called Shah group affiliated with the Salafi Ahle - Hadith sect , were subsequently freed through the intervention of a jirga of religious scholars , including Maulana Sher Ali Shah , an Islamic teacher at the Darul Uloom Haqqani seminary in Akora Khattak near Peshawar . In the end , Baitullah Mahsud and the TTP just kept quiet and took no action against Omar Khalid as this would have created disharmony in the organization and possibly even caused a parting of ways between it and its chapter in Mohmand Agency . South Waziristan While discussing the leading figures of the ongoing insurgency in the NWFP , it would be worthwhile to start in South Waziristan , where the Pakistan Army began its military operations in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) in early 2004 and suffered heavy casualties in fierce clashes in Kalosha near the regional headquarters at Wana . The Wana region is inhabited by the Ahmadzai Wazir tribe , which has historically been a foe of the neighboring Mahsud tribe to which Baitullah Mahsud belongs . Both Ahmadzai Wazirs and Mahsuds are Pashtun , the ethnic group to which the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban belong , but they have long been traditional rivals in South Waziristan and competed with each other for political and economic power . Baitullah Mahsud was an obscure Taliban commander in 2004 when Nek Mohammad from the Ahmadzai Wazir tribe in Wana was occupying the media limelight . The 27 - year old Pakistani Taliban commander had fought the Pakistan Army to a standstill and forced it to conclude a peace accord with him largely on his terms . The signing ceremony was held in one of his strongholds , Shakai , near Wana , where the Pakistan Armys Corps Commander for Peshawar , Lieutenant - General Safdar Hussain , publicly embraced and garlanded Nek Mohammad and hailed him as a partner in peace . Subsequently in February 2005 when the government signed a similar peace agreement with Baitullah Mahsud in Sararogha in South Waziristan , the same army general described Baitullah as a soldier of peace ( The News International , February 10 , 2005 ) . Commander Nek Mohammad was killed in April 2004 in a US missile strike on his hideout in a village near Wana . His death not only led to the collapse of the peace accord he had signed with the government but also resulted in a rift among his Taliban followers in Wana on the issue of his succession . Haji Mohammad Omar declared himself the new head of the Taliban in Wana but certain other commanders declined to accept his decision . Eventually , a five-member Shura , or council , emerged to jointly led the Wana Taliban . The Shura included Haji Omar , his brother Haji Sharif Khan , Javed Karmazkhel , Maulana Abdul Aziz and Maulana Mohammad Abbas . The Pakistan government subsequently made a peace deal with this Shura , sometimes called the Wana 5 , and allowed it to form a so-called peace committee that was given an administrative role to man roadside checkpoints and provide security to the people . Conflict with the Uzbeks In 2007 , serious differences emerged among the Pakistani Taliban in Wana over the presence of foreign militants belonging to Uzbekistan in the area . A majority of Taliban and Ahmadzai Wazir tribesmen decided to evict the Uzbek militants , led by Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan ( IMU ) head Tahir Yuldashev , from Wana and Shakai . Backed by the Pakistan government and military with arms and money , they fought the Uzbeks and their tribal supporters and finally succeeded in expelling them from Wana . A young Taliban commander , Maulvi Nazeer , led this campaign along with his two deputies Malik Abdul Hannan and Maulvi Mohammad Iqbal . Hannan was allegedly killed in July 2008 by pro-Uzbek tribesmen commanded by Noor Islam , who is the brother of Haji Omar and Haji Sharif ( of the Wana 5 ) , while Maulvi Iqbal died fighting alongside the Afghan Taliban in Afghanistans Paktika province in June 2008 . Apart from Noor Islam , other pro-Uzbek commanders of the Pakistani Taliban from Wana include Haji Omar , Javed Karmazkhel , Maulana Abdul Aziz and Maulana Mohammad Abbas . They had to take refuge with Baitullah Mahsud in the area populated by the Mahsud tribe in South Waziristan after being evicted along with the Uzbek militants . In recent months , the pro-Uzbek tribal fighters of this group have indulged in targeted killings of men belonging to Maulvi Nazeers group ( Newsline.com.pk , July 2008 ) As mentioned earlier , Baitullah Mahsud is the most powerful and dangerous Pakistani Taliban commander . He was accused of involvement in the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December 2007 and blamed for sending fighters to Afghanistan to fight US - led coalition forces . He denied his involvement in Benazir Bhuttos murder but conceded on more than one occasion that he was indeed sending his men to wage jihad against U.S. , NATO and Afghan government forces in Afghanistan ( Newsline.com.pk , July 2008 ) . Other Taliban commanders working under him include Waliur Rahman , who could succeed him in case of his death , and Qari Hussain , known for his strong anti-Shia views and also for training suicide bombers and sending them on their fatal mission . There were reports that Qari Hussain was killed in an airstrike <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Weapon\": [], \"Place\": [\"North and South Waziristan\"], \"Protagonist\": [\"the Tehrik - i-Taliban Pakistan\"], \"Time\": [\"launched on December 13 , 2007\"]}"}

Many seem to have been used infrequently and may have been seasonal meeting places and food stores rather than permanently inhabited settlements . Originating in the later Bronze Age ( 1000 BC - 800 BC ) , the hill forts of the early Iron Age are found over a wide area of the British Isles : in Scotland ( Finavon Fort in Angus ) , Wales ( The Brieddin and Moel y Gaer in Powys ) and England ( Grimthorpe in Yorkshire , Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire and Bathampton Down in Somerset ) . Many seem to have been used infrequently and may have been seasonal meeting places and food stores rather than permanently inhabited settlements . Iron objects dating from the sixth or even seventh century BC are known from England , Scotland and Wales , but the widespread adoption of iron only became common during the fourth century BC . The skill of Iron Age blacksmiths is demonstrated by the range of tools and weapons recovered from the excavation of sites such as Danebury in Hampshire and Llyn Cerig Bach on Anglesey , North Wales . These include saws , chisels and other carpentry tools very similar in form to modern ones . Throughout the Iron Age there is evidence for extensive networks of fields associated with small farming settlements . A mixed farming economy is suggested by cattle , sheep and pig remains and the processing of cereals including wheat , barley and oats . Improved cereal crops and breeds of domestic animal were developed and introduced during the Iron Age . The best surviving areas of Iron Age farming can be seen on Salisbury Plain , the Marlborough Downs , the Cheviot Hills and other upland areas . By the fourth century BC , many parts of Britain were dominated by hill forts . In some areas , such as central southern England and the Welsh borders , they were very large with complex earthworks and entrances ( Maiden Castle in Dorset ) . There are significant examples in north Wales , the Borders and eastern regions of Scotland and in Northern Ireland ( parts of the Navan complex ) . Many of these sites supported sizeable populations and acted as service centres for a growing rural population . The earliest ' brochs ' date from 500 - 200 BC , and many were still occupied into the first millennium AD . They were built using two concentric , dry-stone walls to create a hollow tower . Between the walls were galleries and stairways leading to upper levels . Wooden upper floors probably provided the main living space , with the ground floor used as a secure store for livestock . Brochs are mainly located in northern and western Scotland , Orkney and Shetland , with the best example at Mousa on Shetland . Pytheas of Massilia ( now Marseilles ) , a Greek merchant and explorer , circumnavigated the British Isles between about 330 and 320 BC and produced the first written record of the islands . He described the inhabitants as skilled wheat farmers , usually peaceable , but formidable in war when they used horse- drawn chariots . He also described the Cornish trade in tin with the Mediterranean . Built on large timber platforms , these settlements were set on the edge of a now vanished area of marsh and open water . Excavation has recovered thousands of wooden and other organic artefacts that rarely survive from dry-land settlements , and which provide greater insight into the skills of Iron Age woodworkers . In Northern Ireland , Scotland and Wales , smaller lakeside settlements called ' crannogs ' are known . Many of these survived into the Roman period and later . The later Iron Age saw the creation of superb bronze and gold objects . Many of these items were deliberately buried or placed in rivers and lakes , probably as religious offerings . Finds from the Thames include the Battersea Shield and the Waterloo Helmet . In eastern England a number of hoards of gold ' torcs ' ( neck -rings ) are known , most notably from Ipswich and Snettisham in Norfolk . There have also been significant later Iron Age finds in Scotland and north Wales . The first coins found in Britain were gold and minted in France . Around 80 - 60 BC , production started in Britain and by 20 BC silver and bronze were used in south east England . Coins began to bear the names of rulers , some titled ' Rex ' ( Latin for king ) and some naming the place they were minted , such as Camulodunum ( Colchester ) . These inscriptions suggest a growing level of literacy and familiarity with Latin . No Iron Age coins were produced in northern England , Wales , Scotland or Ireland . After conquering Gaul ( modern France and Belgium ) , Julius Caesar crossed the Channel with two legions - about 10,000 men - probably to carry out reconnaissance and send a warning to the British allies of Gaulish tribes . Local tribes contested his landing on the beach at Deal near Dover , but their war chariots were driven back and they subsequently sought a truce . Caesar returned to the continent for the winter after bad weather damaged his fleet and prevented cavalry reinforcements arriving . Julius Caesar invaded Britain for the second time with five legions - about 25,000 men - and won a series of battles before his fleet at Deal was once again wrecked by storms . This delay allowed the British to regroup under Cassivellaunus , ruler of the Catuvellauni tribe . He waged an effective guerrilla war before his betrayal by rival tribes handed Caesar victory . An impending rebellion in Gaul forced him to withdraw , never to return , but Britain was now within Rome 's sphere of influence . Commius , ruler of the Gaulish Atrebates tribe , fled Gaul and became king of the Atrebates tribe of south - central England , with a capital at Silchester ( near Reading ) . There he issued his own coinage , the earliest examples dating from 30BC . Commius was a former ally of Rome and had accompanied Julius Caesar on both of his expeditions to Britain . He joined the Gaulish revolt under Vercingetorix in 52 AD and fled Gaul after a second failed revolt the following year . The settlements known as ' oppida ' ( from Latin , meaning an administrative centre ) were usually very large sites , sometimes defined by rivers or long ditches and banks . Many are associated with centres of tribal power , trade with the Roman world and rich burials . Examples include Colchester , St Albans and Silchester in southern England . By the time of the Roman invasion , they could be found as far north as Stanwick in Yorkshire . No oppida are known in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland . Having defeated the last of his civil war rivals in 31BC , Augustus looked to set secure borders for Rome 's empire . Plans were drawn up for an invasion of Britain , but they came to nothing . In his political testament ' Res Gestae ' , Augustus counts among his deeds that he received supplications from two British kings , Dumnobellaunus and Tincommius . Relations between Rome and Britain remained good for the next two generations , with evidence that Rome had a healthy trade with the Britons . Limited trade in Roman goods such as wine had been underway since about 120 BC . From 20 BC this trade intensified with sites such as Colchester , St Albans and Silchester receiving large quantities of imported pottery , wine and metalwork . Britain was exporting too , including slaves , grain , hunting dogs and precious metals . It is possible that some of the tribes in the south east developed diplomatic links with the early Roman empire of Augustus and his immediate successors . Cunobelinus ( William Shakespeare 's ' Cymbeline ' ) , ruled the Catuvellauni for about 30 years and conquered a huge territory . His name appears on coins issued at Colchester and St Albans and he is described by the Roman historian Suetonius as ' Britannorum rex ' - king of the Britons . His core territory was Hertfordshire , but he eventually controlled much of East Anglia and the south east . A succession struggle erupted around the throne of the ailing Cunobelinus , king of the powerful Catuvellauni tribe . Adminius , the king 's younger son , was exiled and fled to the court of the Roman emperor , Caligula . His elder brothers , Caratacus and Togodumnus , were left in control of the extensive tribal territories stretching over much of East Anglia and the south east of England . Emperor Caligula ( ruled 37 to 41AD ) planned an invasion of Britain in 40 AD , but he was so much reviled for his megalomania that objective facts about the campaign are hard to discern . It seems likely , however , that he wanted the prestige of conquering Britain - of succeeding where Julius Caesar failed . But the army refused and the invasion was abandoned . Instead , troops were ordered to collect seashells as ' spoils taken from Neptune ' - a favourite illustration of Caligula 's ' madness ' . After the death of Cunobelinus , king of the Catuvellauni , his ambitious sons and successors Caratacus and Togodumnus expanded into the territory of their tribal neighbours . Verica , king of the Atrebates , was driven out of south - central Britain and eventually fled to Rome . As a ' client king ' of Rome , he sought the support of the emperor Claudius in a bid to reclaim his throne . This served as the pretext for the Roman invasion of Britain the following year .

The choice of top-tier teams in the restructuring was met with a significant amount of criticism , especially as Abergavenny had finished within the top four during the 2020\u201321 season and The New Saints did not a complete senior women 's side . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Abergavenny condemns FAW restructure of Welsh women 's football A shake - up of the top two tiers of women 's football in Wales has \" devastated \" some clubs who found themselves demoted despite a successful season . The restructure , confirmed today by the Football Association of Wales , involves the creation of two eight - team Tier 2 leagues , one for the north and one for the south , that will play below the eight - strong Tier 1 division . But the way in which clubs have been allocated to different divisions has prompted an outcry and accusations of unfairness . Last season 's results are not the only factor on which the teams ' league status has been decided . Abergavenny Women 's FC have been in the top league of Welsh women 's football for nine years , winning twice in that period . In the most recent season , they finished fourth but have still been demoted to the second tier in the restructure . Club secretary Stuart Summers said : \u201c We 're absolutely gutted . We 've performed consistently during the nine years in the league and have been the fourth best team and yet we 're being relegated . \u201c We punch above our weight for a small market town . We do n't have the backing of some of the clubs who are associated with the bigger men 's teams . \" We drew 0 - 0 with the champions Swansea yesterday . We 're all devastated . We 're not a professional team and we all use our own money to help the club . The girls are all devastated . \u201d To determine which clubs would take their place in these new leagues , the FAW oversaw an open application process that involved two stages . The first was the initial licence award where clubs provided evidence to show that they met the minimum criteria for each level . Successful Clubs progressed to Phase 2 , presenting their club development plan to a panel of FAW , FAW Trust and FIFA experts who assessed clubs across seven key areas including ' financial sustainability ' and ' human resources ' . Lowri Roberts , the FAW 's head of women 's football , said : \u201c Through implementing an open application process for entry into the new leagues , a club 's place was not solely down to sporting merit but also robust club structures . \" It has made clubs review their entire structure , playing pathways and the provision they provide players . As a result , all clubs will be collectively striving to continuously improve standards in a competitive environment . \u201d The choice of some of the teams included in the premier league has frustrated Mr Summers and the Abergavenny club . \u201c The New Saints have a club in the league , \" he said . \" However , they disbanded their women 's team 12 months ago and are now advertising for players because they have the premier league licence . \" How can a club that does n't have a team get given a place ? \u201c Also , Aberystwyth Town are still in the premier league despite being bottom and only winning one game . \" How are they staying in a ' competitive league ' over a team who have been up there near the top for years ? \u201d The FAW has been contacted for comment . Following today 's restructure , the teams competing in the women 's football pyramid are as follows : Tier 1 : Aberystwyth Town , Barry Town United , Cardiff City , Cardiff Met University , Pontypridd Town , Port Talbot Town , Swansea City , The New Saints . Tier 2 North : Airbus UK Broughton , Bethel , Connah 's Quay Nomads , Denbigh Town , Llandudno , Llanfair United , Pwllheli , Wrexham .

The poster in the DVD \/ poster package that features the Life is a Dream in Cinema DVD . Pola Negri 's place in cinema history cannot be underestimated , as she was the beginning of many firsts in the movies . This list of accomplishments includes popularizing European films in the United States , opening the way for international film artists in Hollywood , popularizing fashions that are with us to this day , and broadening the expression of sex on the screen . She is also remembered for her off - screen love affairs with Charlie Chaplin and Rudolph Valentino and , in fact , was Valentino 's lover at the time of this premature death in 1926 . Life is a Dream in Cinema : Pola Negri brings the story of this great actress back to Life with clips of her films , photographs of the star from throughout her Life , recollections of the people who knew her , and interviews with people who have made a study of her Life and times . The film made its screen debut in 2006 , and has been shown in prestigious venues such as La Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art ( MoMA ) in New York . Actors Hayley Mills and Eli Wallach , both well - known film stars in their own right , performed with Pola in The Moon-spinners ( 1964 ) , her final film , and appear in the documentary . Many other experts in their fields shared a wealth of knowledge and insights about Pola , including : Professor Jeanine Basinger , author of Silent Stars ; A.C. Lyles , producer for Paramount Pictures ; Alfred Allan Lewis , ghostwriter of Memoirs of a Star , Pola 's autobiography ; Emily Leider , author of Rudolph Valentino biography Dark Lover ; Anthony Slide , film historian ; David Gasten , webmaster of The Pola Negri Appreciation Site ; and Scott Eyman , author of Ernst Lubitsch : Laughter in Paradise . Review of Life is a Dream in Cinema documentary by David Gasten After four years of festival screenings , including high - profile appearances at La Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise in Paris and the Museum of Modern Art in New York , Pola Negri 's own documentary , Life is a Dream in Cinema has finally made it to DVD as part of a DVD \/ poster package ! The wait has been long , but it has been worth it . Life is a Dream in Cinema is lovingly produced and directed by independent film director Mariusz Kotowski . Kotowski began his career as a dancer and dance choreographer before transitioning into directing movies . Kotowski 's award - winning films like Esther 's Diary and Deeper and Deeper have progressively earned him respect because their portrayals are decidedly atypical of the standard Hollywood or indie fare , and cleverly mix different film approaches into a cohesive whole . Life is a Dream in Cinema is a fitting opener for a rare director who truly is following in the footsteps of the classic- era stars and directors he idolizes , and creating a recognizably unique body of work in a era when when it seems as though everything has already been done . Life is a Dream in Cinema opens with narrator Cyndi Williams recalling the magic of classic era movie stars , as portraits of these stars flash on the screen . The portraits then move to the silent era , and then zero in on Pola the Star . Pola 's role as a star remains the theme throughout the movie . As the movie rolls on , Pola 's star becomes more personal and loveable , but remains larger - than - Life as it always was . She is a star , but a star that you can reach out and touch with your hand - and a star you can fall in love with . Life is a Dream in Cinema takes the role of a black - and - white movie that dissolves into color from time to time before returning to its black - and - white home base . There is even a filmed Tango scene in which three tangoing couples dancing to Pola 's \u201c Tango Notturno \u201d ( the title track of one of her German talkie movies ) remains in black and white in keeping with the rest of the movie . Life is a Dream in Cinema also features black and white clips from a number of Pola Negri 's movies . Even though the source material of these prints varies in quality and a great number of them are not as strong as they could be , they still convey Pola 's adorably human and yet larger - than - Life presence regardless of the source quality of the material . Probably one of the best findings presented in Life is a Dream in Cinema is Pola 's correct birth date , which had been debated and uncertain for many years . Director Kotowski was born and raised in Poland , and currently lives in the United States . He used his familiarity with both cultures to his advantage by researching Polish language sources in Warsaw and Pola 's birth city of Lipno in Poland . This led him to uncovering Pola Negri's Polish birth certificate , which is shown in the documentary and reveals a birth date of January 3 , 1897 . The initial belief was that she may have been born on December 31 of 1894 or 1897 , and even we at Polanegri.com had reported the incorrect 1894 date . Life is a Dream in Cinema settles the date once and for all , eliminating the need for any further debate on the subject . In addition to a look at Pola 's birth certificate , we get to see her parents ' marriage certificate , the Imperial Ballet academy in Poland where Pola studied dance and acting , and the places where Pola lived and stayed throughout her Life . The two dramatic portions of the film , the tango and the rose petal sequences , are shot in an exquisite way that recalls the glamour of the classic era of movie making . The \u201c rose petal story \u201d from Pola 's affair with Rudolph Valentino that Pola tells in her autobiography Memoirs of a Star ( 1970 ) is one of the most remembered stories from that book . When film historian William K. Everson wrote his original review of the book for the New York Times in 1970 , he mentioned , \u201c Valentino may \u2026 strew their bed with [ rose ] blossoms\u2013but Miss Negri maintains a discreet slow- fade- out - slow - fade - in device in describing their nights of bliss . \u201d Life is a Dream in Cinema recreates the visual of the rose petals on the bed , with Memoirs of a Star 's ghostwriter retelling the story . Like the book , the movie 's recreation also lets the viewer 's mind fill in the details . The biggest upside of the movie is the extensive recollections of the legendary actors Hayley Mills and Eli Wallach , who both appeared with Pola in the 1964 Disney movie The Moon-Spinners . Pola 's scene-stealing appearance in that movie was filmed over the course of two weeks in London , and both actors appeared with Pola in that final onscreen appearance . Although the two actors ' experience with Pola was brief , the strength of Pola 's star seemed to even dwarf their own stars , and the experience of working with Pola left an indelible impression on both of them . This documentary is the only place you will get to hear them retell that fascinating story , which alone makes the documentary worth the purchase price . Pola 's legacy has fallen into incredibly good hands with Mariusz Kotowski and the Life is a Dream in Cinema documentary . When Kotowski was working on the documentary , he told me that he felt almost as if Pola were keeping him accountable from beyond the grave to treat her legacy well . His love for Pola has guided him in presenting a documentary that openly adores and respects Pola as an actress and as a lady . Kotowski does not deify Pola , nor does he revel in scandal - mongering \u201c you ca n't libel the dead \u201d deconstructionism . Life is a Dream in Cinema works not only as a great crash course for learning about the great actress , but also place where you can get to know Pola and fall in love with her yourself .

Still de jure part of Azerbaijan , the territory is de facto under Armenian control . The Artsakh Republic is no longer an enclave ; in 1996 - 1994 the Armenian troops occupied the territory located between the former Autonomous Region and the former Armenian SSR , known as the Latchin Corridor of Latchin , and a lot of other adjoining Azerbaijan territory . A ceasefire was obtained on 12 May 1994 through Russian negotiation . Armenia does not officially recognize Artsakh , though it recognizes its self-determination right and its Army occupies it , as well as a good part of what is generally considered Azeri territory . According to the Constitution ( text , Armenian ; text , English ) adopted by referendum on 20 February 2017 , the official name of the territory is Republic of Artsakh . Mikhail Revnivtsev , Luc Baronian , Zach Harden & Jos Poels , 22 March 2017 The Armenian claim to Karabakh dates back to the 19th century . Armenians who fled Turkey were settled in Karabakh , apparently unnoticed by the Armenians in the environment of Yerevan . Armenia for them was Eastern Turkey , dominated by the mighty S\u00fcphan Dagh volcano , which you see everywhere in Eastern Turkey around Lake Van . After the genocide of 1915 there was not anymore a Turkish Armenia . Only then Armenia sought a Greater Armenia within Russia . It had a war with Georgia about \" Georgian Armenia \" , which was not successful . Before attention was directed towards Karabakh , the area was incorporated into Azerbaijan . According to The Karabakh File by the Zoryan Institute , the English together with the Azeris repulsed Armenian attacks . On 20 February 1988 the Council of People 's Deputies of the Autonomous Region of Nagorno - Karabakh of Azerbaijan SSR addressed to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR , to the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR , and to the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR a request for the transfer of the Nagorno - Karabakh Autonomous Region from the Azerbaijan SSR to the Armenian SSR . On 12 January 1989 the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR adopted the Decree \" About introduction of special forms of management in the Nagorno - Karabakh Autonomous Region of Azerbaijan SSR \" , with effect on 20 January 1989 . The Council of People 's Deputies of the Nagorno - Karabakh Autonomous Region and its Executive Committee were suspended , while their powers were transferred to the newly created Committee of Special Management of the Nagorno - Karabakh Autonomous Region , directly subordinated to the supreme bodies of the Government of USSR . The Decree , for the first time in the history of the USSR , established a direct control on the territory from Moscow . The Nagorno - Karabakh Republic was self - proclaimed , within the structure of the USSR , on 2 September 1991 . This was confirmed by a referendum held on 10 December 1991 , After the collapse of the USSR , full independence of the Nagorno - Karabakh Republic was proclaimed on 6 January 1992 . Jarig Bakker , Mikhail Revnivtsev & Luc Baronian , 13 April 2005 The flag and arms of Artsakh were first prescribed in Article 16 of the Constitution ( text ) adopted in the 10 December 2006 referencum , as follows : 1 . The national flag of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic is a tricolor with equal upper-red , the middle - blue , and the lower - orange horizontal stripes with a white five - toothed stepped pattern on the flag which begins from the two verges of the cloth \u00d5s right side and is connected on one - third of the flag . Law stipulates the detailed description of the flag . 2 . Law defines the coat of arms and national anthem of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic . The very same symbols are prescribed in a slightly different wording in the 2017 Constitution ( text ) 1 . The flag of the Republic of Artsakh shall be tricolor - with equal horizontal stripes of red , blue , and orange and a white five - toothed stepped pattern on the flag which begins from the two verges of the cloth \u00d4s right side and is connected on the one - third of the flag . The detailed description of the flag shall be defined by law . 2 . The coat of arms and national anthem of the Republic of Artsakh shall be defined by law . The flag is derived from that of Armenia , which is a red-blue- orange horizontal tricolour . The westwards pointing arrow signifies very graphically Artsakh 's current separation from Armenia proper , and its hopes for union with the motherland . The design also recalls that of the world famous ( and very expensive ) Armenia rugs . Jos Poels , Zach Harden & Stuart Notholt , 25 March 2017 This flag appears in the Flags of Aspirant Peoples chart [ eba94 ] , # 113 , with the following caption : ARTSAKH ( NAGORNO - KARABAGH ) Armenians West Azerbaijan Ivan Sache , 15 September 1999 Erroneous representation of the flag Erroneous representation of the flag of Artsakh \/ Nagorno - Karabagh - Image by Ivan Sache , 8 September 2003 On an administrative map of Armenia published in 2003 in Armenia , and shown by the French magazine Geo ( August 2003 ) , Artsakh is called \" Republic of Mountainous Karabagh \" . The flag shown on top of the map is , erroneously , mirrored vertically . Ivan Sache , 8 September 2003 Coat of arms of Artsakh \/ Nagorno - Karabakh - Image by Gevork Nazaryan , 8 September 2005 The coat of arms of Artsakh consists of an eagle displayed , crowned with an ornamented crown and bearing a shield on the chest . In the chief of the shield is depicted a mountain range and under it , vertically set , the flag of Artsakh , over all there are two stone heads . The eagle stands on a bunch of different agricultural products ( among which corn and grape ) . All is surrounded with a golden circular ribbon bearing inscription in Armenian script . From around the crown and eagle 's head towards the ribbon there are sun rays emerging . \u017deljko Heimer , 24 May 1998 The eagle is an old Armenian symbol , present on the 1918 and 1991 coats of arms of Armenia . The crown might by an allusion to the six autonomous principalities that existed there during Iranian ruling . The stone monument is a male head and female head and represents the women and men of Artsakh . Its name is \" We are our mountains \" ( another source I have says \" We and our mountains \" ) and it is located in Stepanakert , the capital . The grapevines I believe represent the many vines of the plateau , something illustrated by the Azeri name Gharabagh , which means \" Black Vineyard \" or close to \" Black Garden \" in Turkish Karabakh . ( Nagorno or Nagorny is of Russian origin and Artsakh is Armenian ( the oldest attested ) , but I do n't know their etymology ) . The inscription in Eastern Armenian reads Lernayin Gharabaghi Artsakh Hanrapetoutioun , which means \" Artsakh Republic of Mountainous Karabakh \" . Luc Baronian , 25 May 1998 Nagorny ( I believe this is masculine form , Nagorno would be neuter , depending how Russian speaker interprets the grammatical gender of Karabakh ) means upper , or mountainous . The same Slavic root appears in the name Crna Gora for Montenegro - Black Mountain . \u017deljko Heimer , 25 May 1998 Regimental colour of the Nagorno - Karabakh Army , reverse and obverse - Images by Jens Pattke , 17 June 2012 The regimental standard of the Nagorno - Karabakh Army ( photo , reverse ; photo , obverse ) is Burgundy red , in size 1150 x 1450 mm , with a golden fringe .

On 1 December 2020 , Azereabijani soliders celebrated their victory with a flag of Azerabijan inscribed \" LA\u00c7IN \" in white in the upper stripe ( video , Euronews , 1 December 2020 ) . Jean - Marc Merklin & Ivan Sache , 24 April 2021 Flag of the Council of People 's Deputies of the Autonomous Region of Nagorno - Karabakh - Image by Jaume Oll\u00e9 , 8 September 2005 This flag could have existed , informally , until 1989 only and , probably , since February 1988 . During the existence of the Committee of Special Management of Nagorny Karabakh ( 1989 - 1991 ) , only the national coat of arms and flag of USSR were used in Nagorny Karabakh .

Some wore red shirts , emblematic of the Garibaldini who , during their campaign in southern Italy , were known for pointing one finger in the air and shouting l'Italia Unit\u00e0 ! ( Italy United ! ) . Now they wanted to volunteer to take up arms for l'America Unit\u00e0 ! Meanwhile , immigrants already in the United States responded to the call to arms in extraordinary numbers . In 1860 , about 13 % of the U.S. population was born overseas \u2014 roughly what it is today . One in every four members of the Union armed forces was an immigrant , some 543,000 of the more than 2 million Union soldiers by recent estimates . Another 18 % had at least one foreign - born parent . Together , immigrants and the sons of immigrants made up about 43 % of the U.S. armed forces . America 's foreign legions gave the North an incalculable advantage . It could never have been won without them . And yet the role of immigrant soldiers has been ignored in the narrative of a brothers ' war fought on American soil , by American soldiers , over issues that were uniquely American in origin . In the 1860s , Confederate diplomats and supporters abroad were eager to inform Europeans that the North was actively recruiting their sons to serve as cannon fodder . In one pamphlet , Confederate envoy Edwin De Leon informed French readers that the Puritan North had built its army \u201c in large part of foreign mercenaries \u201d made up of \u201c the refuse of the old world . \u201d Embarrassed Northerners claimed the Confederacy exaggerated how many foreign recruits made up the U.S. armed forces \u2014 pointing to immigrant bounty jumpers who enlisted to collect the money given to new recruits , deserted , and then re-enlisted . The underlying premise was that foreigners were not inspired by patriotic principle and , except for money , had no motive to fight and die for a nation not their own . It was not true . Immigrants tended to be young and male , but they enlisted above their quota . Many immigrants left jobs to fight for the Union , enlisting before the draft \u2014 and the bounties \u2014 were even introduced . They volunteered , fought , and sacrificed far beyond what might be expected of strangers in a strange land . Historians have done an excellent job of retrieving the voices of native - born , English -speaking soldiers . But the voices of the foreign legions remain silent \u2014 thanks to the paucity of records in the archives , the language barriers posed to historians , and , perhaps , a lingering bias that keeps foreigners out of \u201c our \u201d civil war . Why did they fight ? What were they fighting for ? Recruitment posters in the New York Historical Society provide hints at the answers . One poster reads : Patrioti Italiani ! Honvedek ! Amis de la libert \u00e9! Deutsche Freiheits Kaempfer ! ( Italian patriots ! Hungarians ! Friends of liberty ! German freedom fighters ! ) Then , in English , it urges \u201c 250 able - bodied men . . . Patriots of all nations \u201d to fight for their \u201c adopted country . \u201d One immigrant mother gave testimony in 1863 to an antislavery convention as to why her 17- year - old son was fighting for the Union . \u201c I am from Germany where my brothers all fought against the Government and tried to make us free , but were unsuccessful , \u201d she said . \u201c We foreigners know the preciousness of that great , noble gift a great deal better than you , because you never were in slavery , but we are born in it . \u201d Following the failed Revolution of 1848 , thousands of young Germans fled to America . They took up arms in what they saw as yet another battle in the revolutionary struggle against the forces of aristocracy and slavery . \u201c It is n't a war where two powers fight to win a piece of land , \u201d one German enlistee wrote to his family . \u201c Instead it 's about freedom or slavery , and you can well imagine , dear mother , I support the cause of freedom with all my might . \u201d In another letter written to his family in Europe , a German soldier gave a pithy explanation of the war : \u201c I do n't have the space or the time to explain all about the cause , only this much : the states that are rebelling are slave states , and they want slavery to be expanded , but the northern states are against this , and so it is civil war ! \u201d So it was civil war , but for many foreign - born soldiers and citizens , this was much more than America 's war . It was an epic contest for the future of free labor against slavery , for equal opportunity against privilege and aristocracy , for freedom of thought and expression against oppressive government , and for democratic self - government against dynastic rule . Foreigners joined the war to wage the same battles that had been lost in the Old World . Theirs was the cause not only of America , but of all nations . Don H.

In the UK commercial installations exceeding 200 litres and domestic installations exceeding 2500 litres require a bunded tank to comply with Environment Agency ' <event> control <\/event> of pollution regulations '. <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Oil Storage Regulations for Commercial and Domestic Tanks , Drums and Bowsers Did you know that there is a different legal limit on how much fuel you can store at your business and at home ? Storing diesel or any other fuel in the workplace or at home presents a potential risk to both yourself and the environment : when not handled correctly , fuels are a dangerous and highly flammable substance that can cause big problems . Oil is one of the most common reports of pollution , contributing to over 15 % of pollution incidents each year . It can harm plants and marine life , damage rivers , groundwater and soil and destroy natural habitats and drinking water supplies . Different regulations apply depending on where you store your fuel , how much you store and what you are using the fuel for . If you choose not to comply with these regulations , you can be served an anti-pollution works notice or face prosecution \u2013 both being bad news for your operations . This document covers the essential technical aspects of oil storage for both business and home applications . If you have any questions , or want to speak to our team of experts about your fuel and oil storage needs , call us on 0330 123 1444 . Business Fuel \/ Oil Storage If you store more than 200 litres of fuel , you must adhere to the Control of Pollution ( Oil Storage ) ( England ) Regulations 2001 , which refer to : - Red Diesel - DERV - Kerosene - Biofuels - Lubricants or hydraulic oils - Synthetic oils e.g. waste oil and motor oil - Liquid bitumen - based products e.g. damp proofing or road surface products The regulations do not apply to : - Oil stored underground - At a premise used for onward distribution of oil to another location - Agricultural use of oil on farms for the production of heat and power \u2013 this is included the Control of Pollution ( Silage , Slurry and - Agricultural Fuel Oil ) Regulations , 1991 - Waste mineral oil storage Where should I store my fuel tank ? Your tank must be stored at least 10 meters away from inland or coastal waters , away from areas that are at danger from flooding and 50 meters clear of a spring to avoid the risk of pipelines breaking and causing an oil spillage . Your tank should be on floor level or below ground level \u2013 it must never be stored above roof level . Remember , your tank needs to be easily accessed for deliveries and maintenance , but away from areas that are at risk of damage via impact , machinery and weather . If you have any questions regarding the storage of your fuel tank , please call us on 0330 123 1444 for help and advice from our team of experts . Domestic Fuel \/ Oil Storage If you have a new or replacement fuel container installed at your home , such as for your cooker or central heating , you must adhere to building regulations . These vary in Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland . The containers must be designed solely for the purpose of oil storage and must be fitted with a screw cap or closure to avoid leakage of liquid or vapour . Under 30 litres As a home , motor vehicle , boat or aircraft owner , you can store up to 30 litres of petrol without having to inform your local Petroleum Enforcement Authority ( PEA ) . The law requires different containers , depending on how much fuel you are storing : - Up to 10 litres \u2013 plastic container - Up to 20 litres \u2013 metal container - Up to 30 litres \u2013 demountable fuel tank Between 30 litres and 275 litres You can store over 30 litres but less 275 litres of petrol , but you must inform your local PEA via writing , with your name , address and storage location . Between 275 litres and 3,500 litres You can store over 275 litres but less than 3,500 litres , but you will require a petroleum storage certificate and a licence to do so . Again , you must contact your local PEA who can issue you one for up to 3 years , but this is non-transferable . Where less than 3,500 litres of oil is stored , you do not need to follow the Control of Pollution ( Oil Storage ) ( England ) Regulations 2001 , however Building Regulations do apply for new tanks . Remember \u2026 - Do not store fuel inside your house \u2013 the shed or garage is ideal or in open air - You should never manually or electrically dispense \/ pump fuel from a storage tank on site - You must avert any sources of heat or ignition that could set alight - You should only use fuel in the fuel tank of a combustible engine You must ensure your tank is installed by someone who is registered with a ' Competent Person ' scheme as they can self - certify that their own work adheres to building regulations . If you choose not to use a Competent Person , you must get a Building Control Notice off your local council and arrange and pay for an inspection as a homeowner . Whoever fits your tank can be prosecuted if they do not comply with building regulations , however you are responsible for ensuring their work meets the regulations . If you need to store more 3,500 litres of fuel , you must follow Control of Pollution ( Oil Storage ) ( England ) Regulations 2001 and apply for planning permission to install an oil tank with this capacity at home . Where should I store my fuel \/ oil tank ? - At least 10 meters away from inland or coastal waters and 50 meters clear of a spring - Away from areas that are at risk from flooding - On floor level or below ground - Away from areas that are at risk of damage via impact , machinery or the weather - In a location that can be easily accessed for deliveries and maintenance - On an impervious surface if near to delivery area where oil is dispensed For further information , read the relevant regulations : - Control of pollution ( oil storage ) ( England ) regulations 2001 - The Water Environment ( Oil Storage ) ( Scotland ) Regulations 2006 - The Control of Pollution ( Oil Storage ) Regulations ( Northern Ireland ) 2010 Have any questions about the storage of your fuel tank ? Call us on 0330 123 1444 and we will be able to offer advice from a team of experts . Design Standards for Fuel \/ Oil Containers When your tank is being installed , the company must ensure the work complies with Building Regulations 2010 . If your fuel tank is near a river or water source , the company is required to fit a secondary containment , such as a bund to prevent any oil spillages . If you use a company that is not fully qualified , it will be your responsibility if any pollution is caused as a result of poor fuel or oil storage . Suitable oil storage containers include : - Fixed tanks and oil drums - Intermediate bulk containers ( IBCs ) - Mobile bowsers - Some generators and transformers All fixed tanks must comply to British Standard 5410 and be bunded to prevent any spillages , however a drip tray is not suitable on this type of tank . Plastic oil storage tanks A plastic tank must comply with the Oil Firing Technical Association ( OFTEC ) standard OST T100 . What are the advantages of plastic tanks ? - Lightweight \u2013 meaning installation and transportation is easier and cheaper - An insulator \u2013 the transfer of heat from the environment to the contents is slow - Can be custom made - Pliable \u2013 even though it 's shape can deform , they can be easily corrected with little damage What are the disadvantages of plastic oil storage tanks ? - Weak \u2013 exposure to sunlight can degrade and weaken the plastic , making it less suitable for the outdoors - Soft material \u2013 it can become damaged onsite and is more prone to theft as it 's easier to drill a hole into the tank - It 's inevitable that it will absorb some of the fuel which can reduce the integrity of the tank , decreasing the prospect of recycling - It 's limited on how big it can be made before the integrity is affected Metal oil storage tanks A metal tank must comply to OFTEC standard OFS T200 or British Standard 799 - 5 and ideally , be stored above ground . What are the advantages of metal tanks ? - Sturdy \u2013 able to withstand more impact when onsite and reduces the chance of theft - Non-porous \u2013 it will not absorb the fuel enabling it to be recycled more easily - Able to come in larger capacities due to its nature \u2013 enables you to take advantage of cheaper fuel prices What are the disadvantages of metal tanks ? - Heavy \u2013 more challenging and expensive to install and transport - It will corrode over time if not regularly maintained Whether you choose a plastic or steel tank will depend on your operations . Steel tanks offer more benefits to bigger operations that require large amounts of fuel being stored that a plastic tank cannot necessarily handle . However , a plastic tank can be easily moved if required . Give us a call on 0330 123 1444 to discuss what type of tank is suitable for your needs . Maintaining your fuel \/ oil tank 's safety We recommend that you check your fuel tank at least fortnightly to detect any early signs of contamination , such as diesel bug . You are looking out for any signs of corrosion and wear and tear , and also any sudden reductions in the level of your fuel , which might indicate a leaking heating oil tank . Identifying problems early on will reduce the likelihood of hefty costs . You must only fill the tank up to 85 % to leave room for expansion and to avoid any spillages . It is also important to use a trusted and professional company to carry out an industrial tank inspection at least once a year . Unfortunately , the human eye does not have x-ray vision built in , so it is extremely difficult to detect all levels of contamination . Our sister company , Crown Oil Environmental has a team of fully - trained inspectors to get in the tanks where most cannot , enabling our oil tank inspections to be extremely cost-effective . An oil tank inspection can find the root of a problem which can be repaired , eradicating the need of having to replace your fuel and tank . Crown Oil fuel tanks All of our barrels and tanks are perfect for storing all fuels and oils and can even be tailor- made to suit your exact requirements . We supply 205 - litre red diesel barrels that are constructed from welded mild steel and a wide array of tanks that vary in shape , size and capacity . All of our storage facilities come hand in hand with our wide range of ancillary products that are designed to help increase safe handling and storage . Call us today on 0330 123 1444 to order one of our fuel tanks or dispensing products , or simply for some advice . Fuel \/ Oil Tank Connections and Fittings Avoid pollution penalties by using the correct fuel tank connections and fittings When storing a fuel tank on your site , whether it 's at your home , farm or business , you want to be confident that it is in perfect condition all year round . Any leaks or faults in your tank can be not only costly but potentially dangerous too , so it 's imperative that it is well maintained , regularly cleaned and handled safely . To help achieve this , there is a wide range of fuel tank connections and fittings that are required by law to help avoid an oil spill which can result in huge expenditure and possible prosecution . Secondary Containment Secondary containment is required to prevent oil escaping from the tank or ancillary equipment in the event of a leakage or spill .

Publishing from February 2006 from Sharp discussing LED flashing to reduce temporal retinal blur effects with decreasing on - time duty cycle for the backlight . This reduces motion blur due to eye tracking by decreasing the time the backlight is <event> on <\/event> . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> LCD motion- blur analysis , perception , and reduction using synchronized backlight flashing Abstract One of the image quality issues of LC TV is the motion blur . In this paper , the LCD motion blur is modeled using a frequency domain analysis , where the motion of an object causes temporal component in the spatial \/ temporal spectrum . The combination of display temporal low - pass filtering and eye tracking causes the perception of motion blur . One way to reduce motion blur is to use backlight flashing , where the shorter \" on \" duration reduces the display temporal aperture function , thus improves the temporal transfer function of the display . The backlight flashing was implemented on a LCD with a backlight system consisting of an array of light emitting diodes ( LED ) . The LED can be flashed on for a short duration after LCD reaches the target level . The effect of motion blur reduction was evaluated both objectively and subjectively . In the objective experiment , the retina image is derived from a sequence of captured images using a high speed camera . The subjective study compares the motion blur to an edge with a simulated edge blur . The comparison of objective and subjective experiments shows a good agreement . Both objective measurement and subjective experiment shows clear improvement in motion blur reduction with synchronized backlight flashing . - Publication : - Human Vision and Electronic Imaging XI - Pub Date : - February 2006 - DOI : - 10.1117\/12.643893 - Bibcode : - 2006SPIE.6057..213 F <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Place\": [], \"Device\": [\"backlight\"]}"}

Too many of us navigated archaic and confusing election laws , direct and indirect voter suppression , significantly under-resourced election systems and our own frustration with the state of the race \u2014 and politics overall . But what remains true , if you back up far enough to see the full picture , is that our country has been moving steadily in a progressive direction \u2014 led largely by diverse and tolerant Millennials across the country \u2014 on issues of marriage equality , criminal justice , economic opportunity and environmental protection . \u201c What we are witnessing now appears to be a powerful flash of frustration and resistance from an America that Millennials do n't recognize . Unfortunately , they have chosen a truly unique vessel and an historic moment to reassert themselves in the face of a rapidly changing country . \u201c At Rock the Vote , we woke up this morning with full hearts and piercing focus , not just on the next national election in two short years , but on putting the needs of young people , people of color and others feeling under siege , front and center for our new president and the 115th Congress . We will be getting up an hour earlier each day to urge investment in the tools , technology and content our country needs to mobilize the largest , most diverse generation of voters in American history . And we will recommit making our generation the most powerful force for political , cultural , social and economic progress this country has ever seen . \u201c This is a moment for dignity and reflection , but also a renewed fire in the pits of our stomachs as we refuse to let young voters and the future leaders of this country step away from the process . It is a moment to dig in with full hearts , to set in for a battle on the issues we hold most dear and to begin working immediately to ensure every young person in this country recognizes that they are the key to future elections and the antidote to whatever fear , hatred and intolerance may lie ahead . \u201c We represent the most powerful voting bloc in our nation 's history . It 's time we take the reins into our able hands and show the rest of the country what the future really looks like . What a great America really looks like . \u201c We call on all young people to join us as we plan and prepare for what is next . We call on our leaders \u2014 current and future \u2014 to work on creating a more inclusive country that is just and fair for all and reflective of the values of the largest generation in our country 's history .

Maeder has organized a citizen science initiative in Switzerland in which people <event> borrow <\/event> acoustic sensors to record soil sounds in their neighborhoods , creating a national library of soil sounds that will provide a baseline for health of Switzerland 's soil . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> The first time that Marcus Maeder stuck a noise sensor into the ground , it was on a whim . A sound artist and acoustic ecologist , he was sitting in a mountain meadow and pushed a special microphone he 'd built into the soil . \u201c I was just curious , \u201d says Maeder , who is working on a dissertation on the sounds of biodiversity at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z\u00fcrich . He certainly was n't prepared for the clamor of sounds that started to flood his headset . \u201c They were very strange . There was thrumming and chirring and scraping . You need a whole new vocabulary to describe it . \u201d Maeder was eavesdropping , he realized , on creatures that live in the soil . Ecologists have long known that the ground beneath our feet is home to more life , and more diverse life , than almost any other place on Earth . To a layperson , soil seems little more than a compact layer of dirt . But in fact , the ground is a labyrinthine landscape of tunnels , cavities , roots and decaying litter . In just a cup of dirt , researchers have counted up to 100 million life forms , from more than 5,000 taxa . Underground denizens range from microscopic bacteria and fungi and pencil-dot-sized springtails and mites , to centipedes , slugs and earthworms that can reach several meters in length , to moles , mice and rabbits in their tunnels and dens . \u201c It 's a staggering amount of biodiversity , \u201d says Uffe Nielsen , a soil biologist at Western Sydney University in Australia . It 's also a vital one : Collectively , these subterranean communities form much of the basis for life on our planet , from the food we eat to the air we breathe . Today , in a relatively new field known as soil bioacoustics \u2014 others prefer terms such as biotremology or soil ecoacoustics \u2014 a growing number of biologists are capturing underground noises to open a window into this complex and cryptic world . They 've found that something as simple as a metal nail pushed into the dirt can become a sort of upside - down antenna if equipped with the right sensors . And the more researchers listen , the more it becomes apparent how much the ground below us is thrumming with life . Eavesdropping on this cacophony of underground sounds promises to reveal not only what life forms reside below our feet but also how they go about their existence \u2014 how they eat or hunt , how they slither past each other unnoticed , or drum , tap and sing to get one another 's attention . Life underground \u201c is a black box , \u201d says Nielsen . \u201c As we open it , we realize how little we know . \u201d Slithering worms and roots Understanding this underground life is important because soil ecology is crucial . \u201c Soil helps to transform the nutrient elements like carbon , nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium that feed plants \u2014 for food , for forests , or to fill the air with oxygen , so we can all breathe , \u201d says Steven Banwart , a soil , agriculture and water researcher at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom , who cowrote an overview of the functions of soil in the Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences . Worms , grubs , fungi , bacteria and other decomposers are involved in every step . And every soil organism produces its own soundtrack . Root-munching larvae emit short clicks as they break the fibers of their meal . Worms rustle as they crawl through tunnels ; so do plant roots as they push past grains of soils , as Swiss researchers reported in 2018 . But the roots move slower than the worms do , and at a steadier pace . By distinguishing these sounds , soil acoustics stands to shed light on some hitherto unanswerable questions . Like , when do plant roots grow ? At night ? During the day ? Only when it rains ? We humans might be among the last to discover this underground soundtrack . Birds can often be seen hopping across lawns with their heads cocked . Researchers believe that they do this because they 're listening for worms below . Often , they peck at the soil at just the right moment to pull up their unsuspecting quarry . The North American wood turtle , for its part , capitalizes on the attention that worms pay to vibrations from the patter of rain . The turtle stomps its feet on the ground to mimic that patter so the worms come to the surface , providing a juicy snack . Subterranean vibrations can also be key for what appear to be intended signals . Mole rats , living in underground burrows , are thought to communicate with other mole rats in the vicinity by banging their heads or feet against the walls of their tunnels . Leafcutter ants have been observed to create noises when they get buried during nest cave -ins . Other worker ants rush to the spot and start to dig to rescue their nestmate . Some of these underground sounds are audible to the human ear , but many are too high or too low in frequency ( as well as in volume ) . To capture these , researchers use tools like piezoelectric sensors , which work like the contact microphones you might clip onto a guitar . Attached to a nail , sometimes up to 30 centimeters long , that has been pushed into the ground , these sensors detect vibrations that researchers then convert into electronic signals and amplify until humans can hear them . Underground Twitter Carolyn-Monika G\u00f6rres , a landscape ecologist at Geisenheim University in Germany , was among those shocked to discover how much underground noise can reveal . With funding from the National Geographic Society , G\u00f6rres studies root -feeding beetle larvae known as white grubs \u2014 she 's specifically interested in the gases , such as methane , that they emit . Biologists suspect that these small insects , of varying species , contribute substantial amounts of climate emissions , due to their sheer numbers . ( An example of what insect emissions can amount to : Termites are estimated to produce about 1.5 percent of global methane emissions . For comparison , the amount from coal mining is 5 to 6 percent . ) Early on , G\u00f6rres was stumped . How would she know how many of these inch-long larvae were living in a patch of soil ? \u201c Traditionally , you dig up the ground to see what 's there , \u201d she says . \u201c But then , everything is disturbed . \u201d So G\u00f6rres biked to meadows and forests around her town and buried two dozen acoustic sensors in the soil and recorded the larvae going about their business . When she plays the recordings to other people , \u201c some say it sounds like the creaking of a tree , \u201d she says . \u201c Others hear pieces of sandpaper being rubbed together . \u201d G\u00f6rres has learned that she can distinguish between the larvae of the two white grub species she studies \u2014 the common cockchafer ( Melolontha melolontha ) and the forest cockchafer ( M. hippocastani ) by virtue of a buzzing that 's similar to the aboveground singing , or stridulation , of cicadas and grasshoppers . The larvae do this by rubbing their mandibles together . \u201c One could say they grind their teeth to talk to each other underground , \u201d G\u00f6rres says . \u201c The beauty about stridulations is that they seem to be species - specific , just like bird songs . \u201d Once the larvae pupate , they switch to another noisemaking mechanism , rotating their abdomen within their shell and banging it against the shell wall . What are they doing it for ? That is n't clear . Above ground , insect stridulation attracts mates . But for larvae , \u201c reproduction does n't matter yet , \u201d G\u00f6rres says . To learn more , the ecologist ( who has dubbed her soil acoustic project \u201c Underground Twitter \u201d ) filled containers with sandy soil from the insects ' natural habitat , added slices of carrots to keep the grubs happy , and took them to her lab . She noticed that a larva kept on its own rarely stridulated . But if more than one shared a container , they sang \u2014 a lot . A trio of cockchafer larvae stridulated a total of 682 times during their first two and one - half hours together . G\u00f6rres suspects that the grubs sing to warn each other away . Larvae are consummate feeders \u2014 \u201c their one purpose in life is to gain biomass , \u201d she says \u2014 and if too many share the same bit of soil , they start cannibalizing each other . In support of this , she notes that scientists have spotted larvae changing course to avoid abdomen-banging pupae . Sound in the ground When we talk about sound , we mostly refer to pressure waves that travel through the air . As they hit our ears , they vibrate the eardrums , and our brains ultimately translate these oscillations into sounds . But these waves can also travel through other media , like water or soil . Elephants know this well : They vocalize a low- frequency rumble that propagates through the ground , enabling them to keep in touch with far-flung brethren who pick up the signals with the soles of their feet . Acoustic emissions can also travel through different media simultaneously . Male mole crickets ( Gryllotalpa major ) dig horn - like burrows into sandy soil , from which they stridulate by rubbing their wings together . The chirping aims to court females that are flying in the air . But it also travels as vibrations through the soil where it may warn off other male crickets in their own subterranean burrows . Some animals have adapted their ears to better catch such substrate - borne vibrations . In the Namib Desert lives a golden mole , a small , furry mammal that is nocturnal and mostly blind . At night , the mole hunts for termites in the dunes by \u201c swimming \u201d through the sand with its head and shoulders submerged . Biologists think that it does so to listen for prey . One of the ossicles , or bones , in the mole 's middle ear is massively enlarged . Researchers believe that this helps the animal to pick up ground - borne vibrations in a process that 's similar to what happens with air - borne sound waves in human ears . Snakes , on the other hand , receive vibrational signals through sensors in their jaws . The star- nosed mole sports a strange , tentacled nose that can pick up vibrations . And many insects have mechanosensors in their legs that register pulsing in the ground . It makes perfect sense that underground animals incorporate sound into their lives , says Matthias Rillig , a soil ecologist at the Free University of Berlin . \u201c Sound is a high - speed signal that comes at little extra cost , \u201d he says \u2014 certainly less than producing chemicals like pheromones for communication . Sound also tends to travel faster and farther than chemical signals . The rumble of an elephant can propagate for miles . Vibrations initiated by a small underground insect may only reach a few dozen centimeters , but in a world where much is measured in micrometers , that 's still a long distance . Do life forms other than animals sense these underground vibrations and make use of them ? Rillig has begun a project in which he and Maeder bring tiny soil critters like springtails and soil mites into the lab and record them for hours to test how much noise they make , either alone or grouped with other species . The ecologist wonders if fungi might be able to register sounds coming from these microp <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Lender\": [\"Marcus Maeder\"], \"Borrower\": [\"people in Switzerland\"], \"Place\": [\"Switzerland\"], \"Theme\": [\"acoustic sensors\"]}"}

More specifically , in a Daily Show segment , he said that Lincoln started the war \" because he wanted to preserve the union , because he needed the tariffs from the southern states , \" a claim rejected by a panel of three distinguished historians of the Civil War : James Oakes , Eric Foner and Manisha Sinha . Napolitano argued that Lincoln could have solved the slavery question by paying slaveholders to release their slaves , a method known as compensated emancipation , thereby avoiding war . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> In proof that the past is never settled business , Daily Show host Jon Stewart and Judge Andrew Napolitano of Fox News threw down last week over whether the Civil War needed to happen . Napolitano argued that the bloody conflict was President Abraham Lincoln 's war by choice . Stewart could n't see how Napolitano , a libertarian , could oppose a war against the ultimate denial of freedom , American slavery . We checked four claims from their energetic debate , two from each of them . Neither passed with flying colors . Stewart : Lincoln tried to pay to free the slaves but found no takers One of Napolitano 's arguments was that Lincoln could have bought the slaves and freed them and saved thousands of lives and billions of dollars . Stewart said Lincoln did try to buy the slaves , but the states and slave owners were n't interested . We found that Lincoln had put over $ 700,000 dollars on the table to liberate Delaware 's slaves and , as Stewart said , the Delaware Legislature said no thanks . Lincoln also got Congress to approve a slave purchase bill , but there was never any indication that slaveholders in any Union or Confederate state were ready to negotiate . Soon after , Lincoln announced his Emancipation Proclamation freeing all slaves in the Confederate states . Stewart 's claim rates True . Napolitano : Lincoln tried to arm the slaves Napolitano might not have wanted Lincoln to go to war to free the slaves , but he had no problem if the slaves rose up to free themselves . When Stewart pointed out how impossible that would be for slaves , Napolitano said that Lincoln had tried to arm the slaves . \" If the slaves had gone to war against their slave owners , and I had been alive , I would have been with them . I would have helped finance , fund and lead that revolt , \" Napolitano said . \" Are you familiar with slavery ? \" Stewart asked . \" I am very familiar with it , \" responded Napolitano . \" That is not the option , \" Stewart said . \" No , no , no . Lincoln tried to arm the slaves , \" answered Napolitano . Napolitano gave us no proof ( we did n't hear from him at all ) and two prominent historians said they had never heard of such an effort . \" I know of no evidence -- have never even heard it said -- that Lincoln himself tried to arm those who were still slaves to enable a slave insurrection -- and I very strongly doubt that any such evidence exists , \" said Bruce Levine , a Civil War historian at the University of Illinois . We rate this claim Pants on Fire . Stewart : The American slave trade caused at least 5 million deaths When Napolitano said Lincoln could have avoided a war that cost the lives of about 785,000 people , Stewart said the American slave trade had cost at least 5 million lives . But in doing so , Stewart appears to have mixed up the Atlantic slave trade with the American slave trade . A historian who appeared on The Daily Show said the slave trade might have caused as many as 5 million deaths , but she was talking about the entire Atlantic slave trade . Only three percent of the slaves shipped from Africa to the Western Hemisphere wound up in North America , experts told us . Historian Herbert Klein of Columbia and Stanford universities , who worked on a database to quantify the slave trade , said that the data suggest about 85,000 people destined for North America did not survive the trip across the Atlantic -- far below 5 million . While there is no fully accurate tally of the death toll due to slavery , we found no evidence that the number even approaches 5 million . We rate the claim False . Napolitano : Lincoln enforced the Fugitive Slave Act Among the steps Napolitano said Lincoln could have taken before going to war would have been to stop sending escaped slaves back to their owners . To hear him tell it , Lincoln and other federal officials worked at this throughout the Civil War . \" If there is ever any use of federal power that is justified , would it not be to end the most horrific , abhorrent practice in the history of mankind ? \" Stewart asked Napolitano . \" After it had tried everything else , \" Napolitano said . \" Like abolishing the Fugitive Slave Act , which Lincoln enforced and his judges enforced and his federal marshals enforced until the Civil War was over and Lincoln was nearly dead . \" The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 made it easier for slave owners to use the federal government to get back the people who had escaped bondage . If a person found refuge in a free state , the act expanded the number of federal officials who could order their rendition back into slavery . The act also simplified the legal steps required by the owner to prove his claim and required the state to bear any costs involved . While there were cases when Lincoln enforced the law during the Civil War , he did so selectively when he thought it would help keep border states in the Union fold . When it came to slaves from Confederate states , the weight of the government actions fell heavily on the side of refusing to return escaped slaves . At the least , Napolitano gets his dates wrong . Congress repealed the Fugitive Slave Act in 1864 , a year before the war ended . We rate this claim Mostly False .

In early 2000 , local Taliban authorities asked for the UN 's assistance to <event> rebuild <\/event> drainage ditches around the tops of the alcoves where the Buddhas were set . Semple , Michael Why the Buddhas of Bamian were destroyed , Afghanistan Analysts Network 2 March 2011 <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> posted : 02-03-2011 \/ by : Michael Semple It would have been possible to save the Bamian Buddhas from destruction . But it was not an important enough issue for the western powers to intervene over . And the outsiders who did consider the Buddhas important were not prepared to contemplate the kind of intervention that might have worked . The Buddhas were abandoned , argues our guest blogger Michael Semple ( * ) who has been in the midst of these events . Taleban officials , acting under the direct authority of their leader Mullah Omar , and with encouragement from their international and Pakistani jihadi allies , detonated the explosives under the Buddhas ten years ago . They thus take the blame for the destruction of these monuments . But there are some co-accused . The international community , through its disengagement and lack of seriousness in rendering effective assistance in Afghanistan , takes the blame for failing to prevent the destruction of the Buddhas . As the rock - cut figures were clearly a piece of world heritage , the failure to prevent the destruction was a lapse in ' duty of care ' . Of course , the world protested - both during the run up to the destruction and afterwards . But this was rhetorical . At no stage did any serious international actor ask what has to be done to save the Buddhas . There were options available . But they would have required a different kind of engagement from the rhetorical protests . And apparently no sufficiently vital interest was at sake to push people who counted into finding the means to achieve the objective . At the time that the Taleban declared war on the Buddhas , I was serving as a United Nations Regional Coordination Officer , with responsibility including Bamian . I interacted with many of the Taleban figures involved , as well as the armed resistance to the Taleban and the ordinary people of Bamian who were horrified at what was being done literally over their heads . I also briefed the range of international players who expressed concern on the issue , including UN Secretary - General Kofi Annan who visited Islamabad just as we received confirmation that the deed had been done . From what I saw during that episode I was convinced that we could help Afghans to save the Buddhas . But it would have required rather more lateral thinking that strait - jacketed diplomacy was capable of . The first point to make is that many Afghans , including figures inside the Taleban Movement , took pride in the Buddhas as a part of their heritage and were fully opposed to the idea of destroying them . In 1997 , when Taleban commander Abdul Wahed led a Taleban column attacking Bamian , then held by the Shia alliance Hezb-e Wahdat , he declared his intention to destroy the Buddhas . The Director of Archaeology of the Hazarajat regional government ( such an entity operated , de facto ) got on the phone to the BBC and triggered an international media alert . However it was sacrifices by Afghan young men on the front line against the Taleban which , that time , kept the barbarians out of Bamian . The Hazara front line held , the Taleban failed to capture Bamian and Abdul Wahed was forced to bide his time . In 1998 when the Taleban did shoot their way into the Bamian valley , Abdul Wahed established a presence in the town and prepared to deliver on his threat . He had holes drilled around the head of the small Buddha ready for the placing of explosives . However Mullah Omar appointed Maulawi Muhammad Islam of Ru-ye Doab as Bamian governor . As a Tatar from neighbouring Samangan Province , the Maulawi had connections with all the commanders of Bamian from the jihad era . Whatever his other sins , Bamian was also a part of Maulawi Islam 's heritage . His deputies described to me how , when they saw what Abdul Wahed was doing , they contacted Mullah Omar in Kandahar and he gave the order to stop further drilling . That time round the combination of local mujahedin commanders within the Taleban structure and a supportive Mullah Omar saved the Buddhas before the world was even aware of the threat . In those days about the worse thing that happened was that a group of Taleban burnt tyres on top of the great Buddha . I managed to photograph the blackened head in early summer of 1999 , when inspecting the havoc which the Taleban had wreaked on the civilian infrastructure . Thousands of houses and numerous Shia places of worship had been burnt down . Taleban had deliberately devastated the town after a brief Hezb-e Wahdat - led rebellion . But the Buddhas escaped with a black eye . In the autumn of 2000 , in one of my meetings with the Taleban authorities in Bamian , among other projects which they proposed , they requested United Nations assistance to reconstruct the network of drainage ditches around the top of the niches in which the Buddhas rested . They were concerned at the prospect of erosion damage if the ditches were not maintained . I agreed to pass on the various projects ( our bit of the UN of course did not have any money ! ) meanwhile I recall quipping that in the current atmosphere Buddas were troublesome and so it might be better to brick up the niches and pretend to the Kandahari brothers that the Buddhas had left . The Taleban leadership was by then lumbering along the path of confrontation , with moves to browbeat the UN and rather fantastic ordinances and prohibitions to control the population . However , war had not yet been declared on idols . The first sign of this war on idols came when news leaked out of the Kabul Museum that a party of senior Taleban had forced their way in and sledge - hammered part of the museum 's collection of ancient statues . There was much speculation over whether this was genuine iconoclasm or a cover for smuggling antiques . However it inspired the first level of international response . Concerned Afghans tipped off an enthusiastic NGO , the Society for Preservation of Afghan Cultural Heritage ( SPACH ) which managed to trigger a troika of European ambassadors to travel from Islamabad to Kabul to intercede with the Taleban authorities . They stayed for nearly a week . But we knew that there was trouble when affable Taleban Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmad Mutawakel came back with the response that he required the clearance of higher authorities to be allowed to visit the museum . Meanwhile , Mullah Omar signed off on a rapidly composed new ordinance which provided the Taleban version of legal cover for the idol-smashing . Now the Buddhas of Bamian really were in trouble . Things turned bad during the winter of 2000\/01 . For me , the most horrendous sign that the Taleban were prepared to sanction atrocities from the top came with the Yakaolang massacre in January 2001 . During 1999 and 2000 those of us who were on the ground had documented a sort of war against the civilian population , including the burning of houses in areas deemed hostile , the summary execution of groups of prisoners and mass round - ups into detention . But in Yakaolang , a district centre west of Bamian town , with Mullah Omar 's sanction , the Taleban commander operated a firing squad and had one hundred and sixty - six Hazara civilians machine - gunned . Next the Taleban rhetoric started against idols in general and the Bamian Buddhas in particular . It was widely discussed and commented on . Everyone knew it was coming . Various Taleban friends also described meetings they participated in , in which some tried to argue in favour of saving the heritage again , until it became clear that , unlike 1998 , this time the leadership had decided to sanction an assault on the Buddhas . But there still were Afghans who could have been helped to intervene . The centre of Bamian was indeed garrisoned by the Taleban . The garrison consisted of mixed forces of local mujahedin , mainly Sunni Tajiks ( from Bamian province ) and a few Hazaras who had sided with the Emirate , plus core Taleban troops from Helmand and Kandahar . But there was also a resistance front operating in the vicinity . The Hazaras had struggled to rekindle armed resistance after the defeat in 1999 . By early 2001 , the tenuous supply lines had been re-established . Ustad Abdul Karim Khalili - now the Second Vice President of Afghanistan - was back in the field at the head of an out - gunned and out - numbered army which , when under pressure , had to disappear into the mist . But in winter \/ spring 2001 they were keeping Bamian under threat and even managed to capture it briefly for a couple of days . The Tajik Taleban commanders laughed loudly as they described to me how they had lost Bamian . They described it as going home for the weekend . When they saw the Tajiks retreating , the Kandahari forces , fearing having their throats cut by the wild Hazaras , had pulled out in panic . Hezb-e Wahdat moved in . The Tajiks and Kandaharis contacted Defence Minister Mullah Obaidullah , asking for more supplies . He obliged them . And the Hazara forces discretely pulled out again before the Taleban returned . A reverse replay of this was all that was needed to save the Buddhas . The Tajik commanders pointed out that Khalil 's front - line was not far from the centre of the valley where the Buddhas were located . It just required someone to orchestrate a modest advance from Khalili , a choreographed retreat by the Tajiks , another panic among the Kandaharis - and the Buddhas could be left in no-man 's land , looking down on the two parties . The Taleban could promise to Mullah Omar that they would blow up the Buddhas whenever they got the chance . And they would wait , in classic Afghan style , for something to happen which would get them all out of the stand off . Parking the issue , it is called in the jargon . As part of my duties in aid coordination I met regularly with Ustad Khalili . His cooperation was essential to our efforts to assist the displaced population in the growing area which his resistance forces controlled . I asked him if he thought that such a choreographed move might be possible . He knew the Tajik commanders I had talked to and said yes . He was happy with the idea . It is Afghanistan . There was of course a question of money . Afghan commanders and armies rarely move without money . Who was going to pay to get the Tajik commanders to fall into line ? I never went into the costing or the mechanics of who in the command chains needed to receive money to shift the frontline by a kilometre or so . I guessed that they were talking in the range of a hundred thousand dollars . We thought that was a lot of money in those days - but after September we realised it was peanuts . It seemed plausible that a cash injection would be part of any successful deal . I was careful not to ask too many questions on that as the UN certainly did not have the money and in Afghanistan the wise man should never boost expectations . When the Taleban really did start to prepare to blow up the Buddhas , the rhetorical international operation , for all and sundry to be seen to be condemning it , started . The most sincere effort was , I believe , that of a Japanese parliamentary delegation . Three parliamentarians based themselves in Islamabad and started a shuttle diplomacy to Kandahar where they met <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Components\": [], \"Time\": [\"In the autumn of 2000\"], \"Agent\": [\"the Taleban authorities\", \"United Nations assistance\"], \"Place\": [\"Bamian\"], \"Created_entity\": [\"the network of drainage ditches around the top of the niches in which the Buddhas rested\"]}"}

The BBC , who had to host the contest that year , did not give the song its whole - hearted support <event> because <\/event> it was the favourite to win the contest and , if it had won , then they would have to finance and host the 1978 contest , inspiring the plot used in \" Eurovision Song Contest : The Story of Fire Saga \" . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> The files show that BBC bosses who organised the 1977 contest breathed a sign of relief when France 's entry Marie Myriam and her song L'Oiseau Et L'Enfant beat Britain 's Lynsey De Paul and Mike Moran , who had been favourite to win with their song Rock Bottom . The revelation will embarrass the Corporation , which has been one of the largest financial contributors to the 53- year - old contest and which this year has enlisted the help of Lord Lloyd Webber in a desperate attempt to reverse more than a decade of low scores . The BBC papers also detail the low esteem in which the contest was held by some senior BBC figures , and reveal that the contest was nearly scrapped altogether in 1970 over concerns about ' trite ' songs and partisan voting . But it is the revelation that the BBC was actually relieved to lose the event which will cause the most surprise . The UK had won the 1976 contest with Brotherhood of Man's Save Your Kisses for Me. Following the custom that the winning nation plays host the following year , the 1977 event was staged at Wembley Conference Centre on May 7 , with Angela Rippon , the newsreader , as comp\u00e8re . Minutes of a meeting of the BBC governors held on May 20 describe comments made by one of the board of governors George Howard , who later became Baron Howard of Hederskelfe . They stated : \" Mr Howard said that when it seemed that the UK would win the contest ( and have to pay for it again in 1978 ) BBC faces at Wembley had grown longer and longer . \" But they had cheered up when L'Oiseau Et L'Enfant won the prize . Lord Greenhill thought the set up had been ugly ; Professor Thompson regretted that Angela Rippon had lost her poise at one moment and Doctor Hughes ' only comment was that the whole occasion had been one of ' grasping vulgarity that he could not bear to watch '. \" According to the documents , BBC figures had previously referred to the contest as \" that absurd tailpiece \" . After a four - way tie for first place in 1969 , the UK turned down the opportunity to play host in 1970 ; the documents note that the Dutch broadcaster NTS \" won ( or should that be lost ! ) \" the battle with France 's ORTF to stage that year 's contest . The files show that the rows over political bias and bloc voting which have marred the contest in recent years are nothing new . In 1976 , the Turkish broadcaster TRT dropped the Greek entry from its own coverage because it believed the song was a critique of Turkey 's invasion of Cyprus and contained \" a strong dose of provocation \" . British viewers , in particular , seem to have been well aware of the partisan voting . A BBC report based on a survey of viewers following the 1968 contest , which saw the Spanish entry , La , la , la , unexpectedly beat the UK 's entry , Cliff Richard singing Congratulations , by just one point , noted : \" Less than a third of those reporting agreed with the choices of the winning song \u2013 while there was , perhaps naturally , a certain amount of disappointment that Britain lost so narrowly , viewers often confessed themselves puzzled as to why the Spanish entry \u2013 with ' no real tune ' and a refrain that consisted of nothing but ' la la la ' \u2013 should have been preferred to at least half a dozen others ( Britain , Ireland and Yugoslavia included ) . \" There would seem to be strong nationalistic influences at work , several were tempted to add , some of the juries obviously being swayed by affinities of language and politics rather than the merits of the song itself . \" The concerns of the viewers surveyed will add credence to claims last year that General Franco , then Spain 's Fascist dictator , secured victory in the contest by bribing foreign juries . Concerns about political voting nearly led to the contest being scrapped in 1970 . Minutes of a 1969 meeting of the European Broadcasting Union ( EBU ) , the federation of national broadcasters which organises the event , noted : \" The Group felt that Eurovision members were faced with a choice to continue the contest in what was likely to be essentially its present form , or bring it to an end and see an altogether new type of competition . \" It also became clear from the discussion that a number of organisations had decided to withdraw from the 1970 contest and that others wished to withdraw after the 1970 , while others were continuing to give it their support merely out of solidarity to the EBU . \" Ironically it was the BBC , which was still enjoying huge audiences for the event , which battled hardest to save it . The Corporation rejected plans by Nordic countries to take the event upmarket , and also insisted that final should take place on one night rather than across several days . A BBC submission to the EBU dated 1965 states : \" BBC television recommends the continuation of an annual contest , while public interest remains as high as in 1965 . \" We do not think it is possible to transform this event into a programme with cultural musical content . \" In our opinion its appeal to the public is a popular entertainment with the attraction of competition and suspense ... All organisations need a large number of light entertainment programmes over the year , the song contest provides such a programme once a year , with the special attraction of an international competition . \" <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Actor\": [\"BBC\"], \"Cause\": [\"Britain 's Lynsey De Paul and Mike Moran , who had been favourite to win with their song Rock Bottom\"], \"Affected\": [\"Rock Bottom\"], \"Effect\": [\"BBC was actually relieved to lose the event\"], \"Place\": [\"Wembley Conference Centre\"], \"Time\": [\"May 7\"]}"}

Many of its phrases are well known and a surprising number have found their way into our liturgies , ranging from the Marriage Service to the Liturgy of Committal . It describes itself as a Song of Victory , and there are undoubtedly martial overtones in some of the verses . But as I read it , the overwhelming impression that it leaves on my mind is as an expression of gratitude , dependence and optimism . And those are the sentiments uppermost in my own mind and heart today as I take up the office of Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland . Gratitude to God for calling me to ordained ministry and for the knowledge that his love and forgiveness are always moving ahead of me . Gratitude to my fellow bishops for their encouragement and support . Thankfulness to the hundreds of people from every corner of Ireland who have written , emailed , messaged or in some other way communicated their congratulations , good wishes and the assurance of their prayers . Since the day of my election on 11 March I have felt buoyed up by wave upon wave of goodwill \u2013 a silver surfer . I am hoping people will hold onto that goodwill even as I make my first mistakes . Along with goodwill goes a strong sense of unworthiness and dependence . I almost said , \u201c an overwhelming sense \u201d , and so it would be were it not for the expressions of goodwill I have already mentioned . And , like the psalmist , a sense of dependence on the dependability of God . I am conscious too of the long line of very distinguished predecessors who have held the office of Primate of All Ireland , and whose scholarship , dedication and spirituality have been an inspiration to me . Most especially I would wish to mention my immediate predecessor , the Rt Rev'd Richard Clarke , from whom I learned so much and whose friendship I value enormously . If that phrase , \u201c John , by Divine Providence , Archbishop of Armagh \u201d has an air of grandiloquence about it , it also has a promise that his making hand will always be on you and me and on the Church we serve , moulding the clay of our vocation to meet the needs of the day . And perhaps , in cases where the clay has hardened with age , to break it and start again . But I also hold a great degree of optimism , because of the role which God , through the processes of history , has opened out for us \u2013 the Church of Ireland \u2013 to take in the years to come . In more normal times I would have had an enthronement sermon and a first Presidential Address at the General Synod to have shared some thoughts about our Church and the societies in which we live . You may be relieved to hear that I 'm not going to roll them into one diatribe now ; but I do want to say a couple of things to do with our distinctiveness and our role in Ireland today . As a Church we have the potential to model ( and in some instances to create ) a witness of deep\u2013seated unity that transcends political , social and generational categories . But we can only do so by being true to ourselves , so that we may more fully \u201c become what we are \u201d . We need to become what Our Lord most certainly was . Someone who listened with supernatural patience . And I 'm not necessarily talking about formal indaba type conferring , but simply in our own everyday encounters , both formal and informal . There 's a fair bit of truth in the observation that , in Ireland , we listen to others ( especially to those with whom we differ ) in order to gather ammunition for criticism . We do not listen to hear . Had the plans for the General Synod gone ahead we would have been presented , as a Church , with many opportunities to explain and to listen ; to speak and to hear . Some of those opportunities would have been , on the face of it , very ordinary . I am thinking here of the opportunity to consider the final pieces of legislation in relation to the amalgamation of the Dioceses of Limerick and Killaloe and Tuam , Killala and Achonry , where the General Synod made space for careful listening and a deepening of communion ( koinonia ) between those who would be most immediately affected by the transition . A period of true dialogue and listening ( adroitly led by the two bishops concerned ) and leading to the building of trust and to positive outcomes with warm feelings likely to germinate seeds for the future . In this category I 'm thinking also of the final stages of the Bill on Diocesan Representation on the General Synod . This was where a group of people from every diocese in Ireland listened patiently to the \u201c whys and wherefores \u201d of equitable ( rather than strictly proportionate ) representation . In so doing , they had to acknowledge that the voice of Jesus is at least as likely to be heard where we are numerically weak as in places where we are strong . To be both the Church of Christ and the Church of Ireland , we need to respect all its people and to sideline none . In such inclusion , we may become more truly ourselves by being an all\u2013island church which incorporates the characteristics of all its regions proudly , rather than being seen as primarily a \u201c Northern \u201d or a \u201c Southern \u201d church . It is appropriate to recall this seminal statement from the Lambeth Conference of 1948 : \u201c The positive nature of the authority which binds the Anglican Communion together is \u2026 moral and spiritual , resting on the truth of the Gospel , and on a charity which is patient , and willing to defer to the common mind \u201d . If a meeting of the General Synod had been possible this year , we would also have had some quite extraordinary opportunities to speak and to listen provided by the chances of history . Here I am thinking , first , of the fact that it was to be held in the venue of Croke Park . This would have offered an opportunity to acknowledge the role which the GAA plays in every corner of this island \u2013 surely the most remarkable and influential cultural and sporting organisation in Ireland today . Also perhaps it would have been appropriate in the setting of Croke Park , and given the current Decade of Centenaries , to have reflected on the tragic loss of life which was occurring all over Ireland in 1920 ; to have listened and spoken about the acknowledgements needed and the lessons learned . And , also historically significant : the dates of the General Synod were to have coincided with the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day . This would have provided the right sort of space to listen to some balanced words on both the end of that particular phase of the war against Fascism and on the rationale behind Neutrality in that time . As a Christian alternative to a rush to judgement , the Synod might have accommodated a ' listening to hear ' , rather than a listening to judge . We are a Church that has traditionally cast its mission in the form of pastoral care . Of course that pastoral care needs to take the form not only of feeding and caring for the sheep but also of finding them . I know many parishes fufill this role by being deeply involved in their local communities and contributing to the common good . And to be true to ourselves , ours must always be a pastoral evangelization : caring , patient , even perhaps quiet ; drawing people to Jesus by the beauty of his person and the depth of his Sacrifice , not by the notion of a competition for souls . And as we reflect on the Sacrifice of Christ , I want to pause for just a moment to notice and give heartfelt thanks for those people , especially those working in hospitals and care homes , who have put the saving of the lives of others above the protection of their own lives . Some have already paid the ultimate price for their bravery and their compassion . So , if you are reading this , perhaps you would now stop for a moment and say a ' thank you ' for all they have done for us . Almost exactly 100 years ago , another postponed Lambeth Conference took place . It had been due to meet in 1918 but had been deferred due to the Great War . One of the main themes the Conference considered was the relationships between Churches , many of which had worked closely together during the appalling suffering of the war years . As the Conference met , an exhausted Europe ( still conscious in some sense of being \u201c Christendom \u201d ) was beginning to recover . The fatalities were infinitely greater and the period of suffering much longer , but the sense of dislocation which the whole world is experiencing at the minute due to the Covid\u2013 19 emergency may be comparable to the trauma of the First World War . In some senses , it is even more destabilising . Although the 1920 Lambeth Conference was unable to make much progress on the matter of formal church unity , it famously issued The Appeal to All Christian People . Rather than addressing itself to formal church structures , the appeal was made to the consciences of individual believers . It ended with these words , hinting at a different form of reconciliation : \u201c We do not ask that any one Communion should consent to be absorbed in another . We do ask that all should unite in a new and great endeavor : to recover and to manifest to the world the unity of the Body of Christ for which he prayed \u201d . We are now most certainly a post \u2013 Christendom , if never quite a post \u2013 Christian , society . Perhaps it is for us , a church of a northern majority but insisting on and valuing the voices of southern brothers and sisters in all the councils of our Church , to work towards a coherent understanding and a living\u2013out of reconciliation . Perhaps it is time to allow us , with credibility , to be in our pastoral mission a living Appeal to All People , and to find in that reconciliation both the work of the Spirit and an enduring <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Agent\": [], \"Initial_category\": [], \"Final_value\": [], \"Initial_value\": [], \"Entity\": [\"Archbishop John McDowell\"], \"Attribute\": [\"his post\"], \"Final_category\": [\"Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland\"], \"Cause\": [\"election\"], \"Place\": [\"in Ireland\"], \"Time\": [\"28 April 2020\"]}"}

President Giorgio Napolitano is likely to appoint technocrat Mario Monti as his successor . Mr Berlusconi lost his majority amid an acute debt crisis that threatens the eurozone . He promised to go once MPs had approved new austerity measures . Crowds celebrated outside the presidential palace , shouting \" buffoon \" as he entered . The BBC 's Alan Johnston in Rome says Mr Berlusconi 's last journey as prime minister was an undignified one . Police struggled to control a large , hostile crowd which booed and jeered as his convoy swept by , and after his resignation he left by a side exit to avoid the protesters . He said he felt \" embittered \" after hearing the insults . Mr Berlusconi is Italy 's longest-serving post - war prime minister . His premiership has recently been marred by many scandals . He is a consummate survivor , our correspondent says , but he was overwhelmed by the scale of the financial crisis which has engulfed Italy . After losing his parliamentary majority on Tuesday , Mr Berlusconi promised to resign when austerity measures , demanded by the EU and designed to restore markets ' confidence in the country 's economy , were passed by both houses of parliament . Members of the lower house voted 380 - 26 with two abstentions on Saturday , a day after the Senate approved the measures that have now been signed into law . Sluggish growth Mr Napolitano 's spokesman Donato Marra said the president had invited the outgoing government to \" remain in power in order to finish current business \" . Consultations on forming a new government would begin on Sunday , he said . Mr Napolitano is expected to formally ask Mr Monti or another candidate to form a government of technocrats . Mr Monti , a well respected economist , is exactly the sort of man that the money markets would like to see take charge at this time of crisis , our correspondent says , and he has support in many quarters . But there is significant opposition to him within the country , and a feeling that Italy 's troubles are just too deep for a mere change of government to make any rapid , significant difference . The austerity package foresees 59.8 bn euros in savings from a mixture of spending cuts and tax rises , with the aim of balancing the budget by 2014 . Measures include : - An increase in VAT , from 20 % to 21 % - A freeze on public-sector salaries until 2014 - The retirement age for women in the private sector will gradually rise , from 60 in 2014 until it reaches 65 in 2026 , the same age as for men - Measures to fight tax evasion will be strengthened , including a limit of 2,500 euros on cash transactions - There will be a special tax on the energy sector On Wednesday , the interest rate on 10 - year Italian government bonds touched 7 % , the rate at which Greece , Ireland and Portugal were forced to seek bailouts from the EU . An EU team has begun work in Rome , monitoring how Italy plans to cut its crushing debt burden , 120 % of annual economic output ( GDP ) . The Italian economy has grown at an average of 0.75 % a year over the past 15 years . Mr Berlusconi has been prime minister three times since he first took office in 1994 . He has described himself as Italy 's best head of government since the country was created nearly 150 years ago . But he is currently involved in several trials for fraud , corruption and having sex with an under - age girl , and has attracted media attention for so - called \" bunga - bunga \" parties which young women were allegedly paid to attend . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Item\": [], \"Cause\": [], \"Place\": [\"Italy\"], \"Agent\": [\"Silvio Berlusconi\"], \"Attribute\": [\"The retirement age for women\"], \"Time\": [\"in 2026\"]}"}

Janet : * shrug * I figured that since there 's an abundance of sexy costumes for women in real life , it 's only fair that our fans that appreciate the male form get some eye- candy this Halloween , too . Edgeworth : But why did it have to be me ?! Janet : \u2026 Are you really still that oblivious ??? * sigh * Do n't worry , the rest of this entry is as wholesome as chocolate chip oatmeal cookies . ======================================== As with any project where a bunch of interesting people get together to make something , there is always at least one silly story worth sharing . From Mr. Iwamoto 's dev blog ( click on \u201c \u5ca9\u5143\u30b3\u30e9\u30e0 \u201d ) for AA3 , we have this little gem \u2026 How did Mr. Kamiya 's drawing turn out ? Well , in the spirit of fairness , only click on this little Mr. Kamiya head if you really want to see ! And on that note , here are some notes of interest about the Trilogy games ! I 'm only including things that I have rarely or never seen on the internet , so hopefully , these will be all new for even you super-fans . Be warned that there are some spoilers for the games , so proceed at your own risk ! Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney \u2013 The secret to Ace Attorney 's simple game design is that Mr. Takumi wanted to make games that were easy enough for even his non-gamer mother to pick up and play . \u2013 When sitting down to write an Ace Attorney , Mr. Takumi has an internal ranking system of each episode 's importance that he follows . The most important episode is always episode 1 , followed by episode 2 , followed by the final episode of the game . While people may wonder why the first and second episodes are more important than the final episode , Mr. Takumi says that it 's because the role of the first episode is to make players like the game , followed by the second episode , which is to solidify their interest . \u2013 The original Japanese version of AA1 only had four episodes . The fifth episode , \u201c Rise from the Ashes \u201d , was added 4 years later when the game was brought to the Nintendo DS . When creating episode 5 , Mr. Takumi wanted to make sure it linked up story - wise with why Edgeworth disappeared in AA2 , so he approached it from the angle of \u201c what would be the most damaging to Edgeworth 's psyche ? \u201d Therefore , despite the seriousness of a topic like police corruption , he felt that corruption and betrayal from within the prosecutor 's office was the way to go . \u2013 The class trial in episode 4 is based on something that happened to Mr. Takumi in real life when he was in 2 nd grade . Here 's what he had to say about it in his AA1 dev blog : I was playing in my school 's courtyard when I found a small piggy bank out by the trash area . Inside was a single 5 - yen coin . Thinking nothing of it , I put the coin in my pocket . The next day , I was forced by a teacher I did n't know to stand before a girl I did n't know in a homeroom I did n't know . The teacher turned to me and scolded , \u201c Stealing is bad ! Now , apologize at once ! \u201d Apparently , the girl 's piggy bank had been stolen and someone had spotted me fiddling with it by the trash cans \u2026 At least , that 's what I gathered after the fact . \u2026 No ! It was n't me ! All I did was find it \u2026! My mind went blank . I did n't know what to do . \u201c Hurry up and apologize ! \u201d the teacher insisted hysterically as everyone in that unfamiliar homeroom glared coldly at me . \u201c \u2026 I 'm sorry . \u201d Tears rolled down my cheeks as I bowed and apologized profusely , over and over . All for picking up a single , stupid , 5 - yen coin . Because there was no \u201c Miles Edgeworth \u201d for me in that homeroom that day , I never became a lawyer . Instead , I was able to use that incident to write a bigger story , so I guess things turned out all right in the end . \u2013 \u201c It could be said that the protagonist of AA1 is Edgeworth because , in a manner of speaking , ' Turnabout Samurai ' exists for Edgeworth 's sake , \u201d penned Mr. Takumi in an AA1 dev blog . \u201c And then , with the theme of the [ fourth ] episode being ' rekindling the relationship ' , I tried to paint a picture of the intensely strong bond of friendship that two men can share , but I wonder if that 's what people got out of it ? There seems to be those who would suggest that Phoenix and Edgeworth 's ' intensely strong bond ' is more of an ' intensely passionate bond ' of sorts \u2026 \u201d \u2013 Episode 3 was originally going to feature a male culprit until AA1 's lead character designer Ms. Kumiko Suekane pointed out that all of the villains were male , to which Mr. Takumi half - joked in his dev blog that \u201c if this were America , we 'd probably get sued for gender discrimination . \u201d Keeping in mind that this is Japan from over 10 years ago and that attitudes have changed since then , there was debate among the team members over what to do with the now female character . Some suggested that it would be odd to have a female director for an action show , while others wondered what they should do about the director role in the story if she could n't fill it . In the end , Mr. Takumi promoted the scriptwriter character to director and really went for it when he transformed the culprit into a \u201c strong , glamorous , fashionable , and cool - headed \u201d female producer . \u2013 Maya was always going to be Phoenix 's partner in crime , but she was originally supposed to be a lawyer - in - training who was preparing to take the bar exam . \u2013 Mr. Takumi claims that he hardly wrote out any sort of backstory for Gumshoe before he started writing . Instead , Gumshoe 's personality and certain aspects of his character just sort of fell into place after Mr. Takumi decided on the \u201c pal \u201d ending of his sentences , while others grew organically out of the story . For example , one time Mr. Takumi was writing a scene when suddenly , Edgeworth blurts out , \u201c I 'm cutting your salary ! \u201d And thus , that aspect of Gumshoe 's backstory was born . \u2013 Ever wonder why Gumshoe always has a red pencil tucked behind his left ear ? That 's because it 's a holdover from when he was going to be a big fan of horse racing . \u2013 Larry was going to be just a normal 9 to 5 office worker who only appeared in episode 4 , but because he was drafted to be in episode 1 when it was added after the fact , his character went through a lot of changes and became the Larry we know today . \u2013 The three medals pinned to Lana Skye 's chest are proof of her three \u201c Prosecutor of the Year \u201d commendations . \u2013 Jake Marshall is meant to be a parallel of Godot in the \u201c Skye \/ Fey sisters \u201d analogy . \u2013 All of the cacti in Jake Marshall 's guard station have names such as \u201c Billy \u201d , \u201c Bogey \u201d , and \u201c Marilyn \u201d . \u2013 Angel Starr 's eyes change colors from black to blue when she changes moods . \u201c Rise from the Ashes \u201d art director Mr. Kazuya Nuri says that it 's colored contacts that make her eyes turn blue . Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney \u2013 Justice For All \u2013 The opening of the game did not originally feature the Judge . In fact , it was supposed to be a demon . From Mr. Takumi 's original storyboards : Apparently , Mr. Takumi was playing Devil May Cry 1 at the time and was struck by how awesome its opening was . \u2013 Pearl was originally going to be around the same age as Maya and would 've been a one - shot , snooty rival character , but at the suggestion of one of the designers who said it would be more dramatic if Pearl was a lot younger than Maya , Mr. Takumi channeled his inner little girl and tried writing Pearl as an 8- year -old . To his surprise , he found Pearl to be so adorable that he included her in more than just the second episode . \u2013 Episode 3 contains the two elements Mr. Takumi really wanted to include : the circus and magic ( in particular because performing magic is a hobby of his 1 .) It also contains two themes he wanted to explore : the difficulties in bringing different people together to form one cohesive team and a person who tries against the odds to make something whole . The first theme is reflected in the way everyone in the circus comes together in the end and the second theme is reflected in Moe the clown . Mr. Takumi said that he felt a little sad and would tear up sometimes as he wrote when he thought about how hard Moe kept trying despite the failures of his terrible jokes and the various props in his room to bring the troupe together . \u2013 There are roughly 3 different versions of episode 4 because of two big reasons : 1 ) Edgeworth 's popularity and 2 ) running out of memory on the game cartridge . Mr. Takumi had written a version of episode 4 in his initial prototype draft , but it was n't until they were already in full production that the team heard about how popular Edgeworth had become . Thinking that he had to use Edgeworth more carefully and sparingly , he created Franziska as a way to avoid having the supposed prodigy lose every case and to save him for the end . As for running out of memory , that leads me to the next bit of trivia \u2026 \u2013 The ideas for the mysterious fifth episode they could n't fit into AA2 due to a lack of cartridge memory were saved for AA3 . So , what was supposed to be AA2 , episode 4 ended up being AA3 , episode 3 . In fact , you can see for yourself that one of the pigeons in Vitamin Square is white . That white pigeon , or should I say \u201c dove \u201d , was supposed to make you wonder , \u201c Could that bird have escaped from a certain magician \u2026 ? \u201d Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney \u2013 Trials and Tribulations \u2013 AA3 was full of ideas that had to be cut due to memory issues . One of them was rookie Gumshoe . Along with sprites for younger Mia , Phoenix , and Edgeworth , there were going to be rookie detective Gumshoe ones with his tie tied up nice and tight and just one spike sticking out of his head . In the end , all he got was a new coat , but even just that had enough of an impact visually . \u2013 Because of a miscalculation regarding the size of all of the game assets , the team wound up having to make Bikini short as a way to save <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Cause\": [], \"Agent\": [\"Mr. Takumi\"], \"Time\": [\"When sitting down to write an Ace Attorney\"], \"Place\": [\"the second episode\"], \"Patient\": [\"their interest\"]}"}

For his part , Ali further stoked the prefight ill-will by labeling Terrell \" an Uncle Tom nigger who is going to get his ass whupped \" . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Ernie Terrell , who has died aged 75 , was a heavyweight boxing champion , but the brutal nature of his defeat by Muhammad Ali in 1967 has been glossed over in the wave of sentimentality that has surrounded \u201c The Greatest \u201d over the intervening decades . The truth is that Terrell , a hulking 6 ft 6in 200lb fighter from Chicago , was on the receiving end of the nastiest display of Ali 's celebrated ring career , after he had persistently referred to his opponent by his old slave name Cassius Clay in the run - up to their savage encounter at the Houston Astrodome on February 6 1967 , when Terrell 's World Boxing Association title was on the line . Ali himself was not blameless in stoking the pre-fight tensions , casually referring to Terrell as \u201c an Uncle Tom n----- who is gonna get his ass whupped \u201d . Many found his words inexcusable even if they proved prophetic . For Terrell paid a high price for his temerity from the opening bell . He took a beating over 15 rounds and was the victim of every trick Ali contrived to pull \u2013 and inexplicably got away with \u2013 in an attempt to break his opponent 's will . Having grown up on Chicago 's notorious south side , Terrell could never have been described as an angel , but the way Ali seized him in a headlock and , in one deft manoeuvre , dragged his eye along the top rope , revealed a dark side the \u201c The Louisville Lip \u201d had not displayed before . The fight will be remembered for Ali 's constant taunts of \u201c what 's my name ? \u201d to an opponent he was apparently content not merely to defeat , but also to belittle and humiliate . It was an unedifying spectacle and Terrell 's anguish was prolonged . Ali 's attitude might also have been spawned by the fact that the World Boxing Association had recognised Terrell as its champion for the preceding two years , having refused to sanction Ali 's somewhat farcical rematch with Sonny Liston in March 1965 , at a time when Ali was unpopular with the American establishment for aligning himself with the Nation of Islam . The subsequent headlines were the worst of Ali 's career , while the referee , Harry Kessler , also drew criticism for failing to protect Terrell and for allowing the fight to continue even after the wilting champion was battered by 30 unanswered punches in round 13 . Terrell 's career never recovered , and for a while there were genuine concerns that his eyesight would be permanently affected . Born into a farming family at Belzoni , Mississippi , on April 4 1939 , Ernest Terrell moved to Chicago as an infant and launched his professional career at the age of 18 . Steadily putting together a string of victories in his adopted home city , Ernie had the bulk and stature , plus an 82in reach , to trouble any of the best heavyweights of the day . But he seemingly lacked the killer instinct , while his mauling , spoiling style would never make him a box-office favourite . Nevertheless , he was good enough to beat rated contenders such as Zora Folley , Jefferson Davis and Cleveland ( \u201c Big Cat \u201d ) Williams ( who in 1962 had knocked him out ) . With Ali frozen out of the title picture , he took on Eddie Machen for the vacant WBA crown at Chicago 's International Amphitheatre on March 5 1965 . Terrell was crowned champion after outpointing Machen over 15 hard - fought rounds , and saw off challenges from George Chuvalo and Doug Jones before his fateful title defence against Ali. Terrell and Ali in the ring , February 6 1967 ( GETTY \/ HULTON ARCHIVE ) Terrell hung up the gloves soon afterwards , having lost to Thad Spencer in a WBA eliminating tournament but , following a three - year lay-off , attempted an ill-advised comeback in 1970 . Eleven successive victories against largely mediocre opposition seemed to have brought the big man back into title contention again , before a shocking first - round knockout by the unranked Jeff Merritt at Madison Square Gardens on September 10 1973 ended his career . In 55 professional fights , Terrell had 46 wins ( 21 by knockout ) and nine losses . Unlike some of his contemporaries , Terrell carved out a respectable post-boxing career , becoming for a time a record producer . Even during his fighting days he had occasionally sung with his group The Heavyweights , which included his brothers J C and Leonard as well as his sister Velma . He was also a successful fight promoter in the Chicago area . He is survived by his wife , Maxine , a son and a daughter . Ernie Terrell , born April 4 1939 , died December 16 2014 <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Place\": [], \"Agent\": [\"Ernie Terrell\"], \"Experiencer\": [\"Muhammad Ali\"], \"Event\": [\"he had persistently referred to his opponent by his old slave name Cassius Clay\"], \"Time\": [\"in the run - up to their savage encounter at the Houston Astrodome\", \"on February 6 1967\"]}"}

The incident occurred at a critical moment in civil rights history . Just a few months earlier , in September 1957 , nine black students attempted to attend the previously all - white Central High . The governor brought in the National Guard to keep them out , but the president trumped the move , bringing in the Army to facilitate their admission . For weeks , angry mobs taunted the black students as they came and went , keeping the story in the headlines . By December , the crowds and reporters were gone , but the harassment by the white kids grew , recalls Minnijean Brown Trickey , who was one of the nine black children attending Central High . Catcalls and worse were a part of daily life as she made her way down the halls . \" We were always getting hit and kicked , \" she remembers . \" Some of the boys wore these toe plates and heel plates so they could kick pretty hard . \" On Dec. 17 , 1957 , things came to a head . Trickey was inching her way between the tables in the lunchroom . \" I was holding the tray above their heads , trying to get through the aisle , \" she recalls . Meanwhile , junior Dent Gitchel was trying to eat his lunch . \" There were some guys harassing her along the aisle , \" he says . \" Some people would refuse to move their chairs , and I think somebody kicked a chair at her . \" Minnijean dropped her tray , spilling chili on Gitchel . \" Pandemonium broke loose in the cafeteria at that moment , \" he recalls . Both students were ordered to the principal 's office . \" When I got to the office , the girls ' vice principal asked me if I had done it on purpose , \" Trickey recalls . \" And I said , ' Accidentally on purpose . ' That 's because I really had n't understood it . \" The school sent Gitchel home to change his clothes . He was back in school that afternoon . Trickey was suspended for six days . Two months later , she was gone ; she would finish high school in New York . Gitchel went on to become a lawyer and law professor in Arkansas . \" In many ways , it was a positive thing because it opened up my mind , \" he says . \" It started the process of changing my attitudes on a whole lot of things . \" Trickey says the chili incident in the lunchroom taught her this lesson : She could not be perfect , even if it meant letting down the people who needed her as a civil rights symbol , and further upsetting the racists who taunted her every day . \" You have to be perfect to come to our imperfect school , \" she says they seemed to be telling her . \" That is the nature of racism .... We 'll do everything we can to make sure that you ca n't measure up , for as long as this country exists .

Pittsburgh , October 1 PENNSYLVANIA justice had spoken . The courtroom was stunned . The three defendants stood immobile . Counsel were amazed . The widow Barkoski stared . Judge Gray turned white . \" Gentlemen of the jury , \" the clerk droned , \" you say you find the defendants not guilty ? \" \" Yes , \" they chorused . Walter J. Lyster and Harold P. Watts turned and nodded to their mothers . Frank Slapikis heaved a sigh of relief . Tears stole down the cheeks of the widow Barkoski . Judge Gray thanked the jury , and the normal courtroom sounds replaced the hush . Thus ended what had started out to be the exercise of justice by a sovereign State \u2013 the fixing of responsibility for the savage killing of John Barkoski , Allegheny County miner . \" This , \" said Prosecutor Roy T. Clunk when be got his breath , \" is the most shocking miscarriage of justice in the history of this or any other country . I am glad the verdict is not on my conscience . \" John Barkoski worked at Montour mine No. 9 of the Pittsburgh Coal Company at Santiago . He had rented a farm , which he worked in his off hours . He hoped eventually to leave the mine forever and spend his days peacefully on his farm . But on February 9 , 1929 , he stepped into his mother - in - laws home , House No. 210 , near the mine , and there fell into the hands of two coal and iron policemen employed by the Pittsburgh Coal Company , Harold Watts and Frank Slapikis . The defense said Barkoski had stabbed Watts . Eyewitnesses for the prosecution said Watts had launched an unprovoked attack on Barkoski . At any rate , Barkoski was delivered to the barracks of the coal and iron police at Imperial with the following injuries : Laceration of the left cheek , five or six head wounds , two broken ribs and a fractured nose . Dr. J. M. Patterson , coal company physician , ascertained these injuries and treated them . He testified on the witness stand that he observed Lieutenant Lyster , who was in charge of the police , kicking and beating Barkoski while the miner lay semiconscious on the floor . Lyster , the physician said , beat Barkoski with a strap , twisted his ears until the man cried aloud , and twisted his broken nose until he lapsed again into unconsciousness . \" All this time , \" testified the seventy - six- year - old doctor , \" he seemed to be trying to make him say something . I warned Lyster ' This will have to stop , now , because his condition is serious . ' Dr. Patterson left the barracks after that . The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania resumed its testimony through another eye-witness , John Higgins , himself a former coal and iron policeman . \" They beat him , they kicked him , they used everything imaginable on him until they took him to the hospital , \" was the way Higgins summed it up . Lyster , the witness said , beat Barkoski over the chest with a poker . He beat him until the poker bent , then straightened the implement and beat the man again . He stripped the miner to the waist , the better to use a strap . He kicked him until the miner 's body rolled over and over on the floor of the barracks . Watts , too , Higgins said , beat Barkoski , kicked him , struck him aver the head with knucklers , and while Lyster grilled him for a confession , slapped him on the arms and legs and neck with his blackjack . The miner , Higgins told the jury , was helpless and unable to answer when the Pittsburgh coal officers said : \" If you do n't admit you stabbed our man , you Hunky \u2013we 'll kill you . \" For more than four hours John Barkoski was in the barracks . He had been examined by Dr. Patterson soon after being brought in . At six in the morning , following his night of torture , he was taken directly to the Sewickley Valley Hospital . On his arrival there , Dr. Herbert M. Fleming , hospital surgeon , examined him . His report follows : He was in a very critical condition , pulseless and unconscious . His left lung was perforated , several ribs were fractured , and he had a possible skull fracture . He was covered with bruises and bleeding from numerous cuts . He was bleeding at the mouth , his eyes were glassy , there was a depression in his head , and the left side of his chest was crushed in . His left lung had evidently collapsed . He was suffering from extreme shock and was on the verge of death , with heart action failing . There was also an injury to the abdomen , accompanied by paralysis of the intestinal tract . According to the testimony of the defense , Watts had been cut by Barkoski and the two grappled . He was forced to strike the miner with his gun . They struggled over hard frozen ground . During this scuffle , the defense maintained , the injuries that killed Barkoski were sustained . There were sweeping denials that any violence had taken place in the barracks , or at any time after Barkoski was arrested . The jury of eleven men and one graying , matronly woman listened attentively to the testimony , but gave no noticeable reaction , except that the woman smiled upon the mother of Watts every time their eyes met , and that a young salesman , Juror No. 10 smiled frequently at a comely young woman who sat in the front row with the defendants ' relatives . The jury was out for eighteen hours , and on the morning of September 28 brought in their verdict . At the next court session , two days after the verdict , District Attorney Samuel H. Gardner went before Judge Gray and moved the court to discharge the jury from further service as \" incompetent and without moral stamina . \" Judge Gray , a man of liberal outlook and independent political affiliations , replied . : ' Your suggestion is altogether proper . I was never more surprised in my life . It seems to me that nothing less than second - degree verdicts should have been returned against Lyster and Watts , although the evidence may have justified such a verdict for Slapikis . I quite agree with you that the jurors were not competent and were without moral stamina . Public condemnation of the verdict was universal and violent .... In a front - page editorial the Scripps - Howard Pittsburgh Press said : \" The State which so freely commissioned armed guards for private authority cannot escape responsibility for the death of Barkoski , even though a Jury says he was not murdered . \" The Pittsburgh Post - Gazette called the action of the Jury \" a miserable travesty on justice , \" but added that it has served \" through the general indignation it has aroused to emphasize one significant point to the lawmakers and other public authorities . The feeling against the private police system that produces such outrages as the one in this case is both wide and deep . It is a feeling that will not abate until the unsound and unjustifiable practice of delegating public authority to private hands is eliminated . \" When the fight to abolish the coal police started last February , Governor Fisher admitted the need of reform and pointed to the fact that he had revoked thousands of commissions during his term . Representative Michael A. Musmanno , defender of Sacco and Vanzetti , first proposed a bill to do away with the system entirely and then consented to introduce a bill sponsored by the Governor which proposed no drastic changes . A similar bill was introduced In the Senate by W. D. Mansfield . Neither measure , however , satisfied the people who sought to wipe out the chief evil of the system \u2013 the right of the coal and iron officers to roam at large and enjoy the powers of a policeman of a first - class city . Musmanno succeeded m having his bill amended so as to grant some of the changes demanded . The Mansfield bill remained as it was . It gave the mine guards powers of inestimable value to coal companies in time of strike : the power to place prisoners in their own or any jail without a commitment by a magistrate ; the right to be a coal and iron policeman and a peace officer of the Commonwealth at the same time . The only changes proposed were that three citizens of the State\u2013officials of the coal companies not excluded \u2013 should indorse each candidate for a commission , and a change in name from Coal and Iron Police to Industrial Police . The Musmanno measure restricted the activities of the police to the property of the coal company except when guarding pay rolls ; required that all prisoners be committed before magistrates ; prohibited the coal policemen from holding other governmental jobs ; and limited the applicants to citizens of the United States indorsed by three reputable Citizens , only one of whom could be an employee of the hiring coal company . With the Musmanno bill amended , the public relaxed its vigilance . The coal operators and other industrial interests then began to put in their silent but effective work to preserve the status quo . The session of the Assembly was nearing its end when the correspondents of the Pittsburgh newspapers at the capital discovered that the Musmanno bill was being allowed to die in committee and that only superhuman efforts could save it . A superhuman effort was made . The public , in press and pulpit , voiced the demand of an outraged community that the Musmanno bill be made law . The members of the Senate judiciary committee grew panicky and hastily reported the bill out . Simultaneously , on orders of the political overlords , the Mansfield bill was revived in the House committee . Both measures were passed and the whole matter laid squarely at the Governor 's door . He signed the Mansfield bill and hurriedly left the capital on a fishing - trip . As far as the Governor and the legislature were concerned , then , the system was to be continued with little change , but the public hoped that the court action in the Ratkoski case would prove an effective deterrent to coal and iron officers in the future . With the acquittal of the former employees of the Pittsburgh Coal Company this last hope for immediate relief from oppression in the mining towns has vanished . The three coal and iron policemen are still to be tried for involuntary manslaughter , indeed . But by this time the public has lost hope . Few expect convictions . Few expect reform . The \" industrial policeman \" can still swagger down the streets of mining towns , his own boss , his own judge and jury . Has John Barkoski died in vain ?

There were construction cost overruns ( and settlements paid to local homeowners for damage and injuries from flying rock ) , with a total cost around $ 5,000,000.00 , that led to financial trouble for the Erie and the cancellation of plans to build a new terminal along the Jersey City waterfront . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Jersey City History The Bergen Arches of the Erie Railroad | Bergen Arches \/ Erie Cut Postcard Courtesy of the Yost Collection | \" These are history making days , \" declared The Evening Journal in 1908 , referring to the wondrous Bergen Arches , a spectacular narrow concrete and blue trap rock canyon of train tunnels and open-air railbeds which were burrowed through the vast Bergen Hill section of the Palisades , in Jersey City , New Jersey , between 1906 - 1910 , and which lunge nearly 5,000 feet east to west from Palisade Avenue to JFK Boulevard . Considered to be one of the greatest examples of railroad engineering on the Eastern Seaboard , the Bergen Arches had been forgotten for decades after being abandoned as a result of nationwide post- war railroad bankruptcies . The Bergen Arches are now encapsulated over time in a canopied forest of urban vegetation and wildlife . The surge of passenger traffic at the turn of the 20th century on the renowned Erie Railroad demanded that the line 's old Bergen Tunnel ( constructed 1856 - 1861 ) be abandoned for a new cleaner , multi-track system . The double - track Bergen Tunnel was notorious for poor ventilation due to enormous steam locomotives ; for gruesome accidents ; and for annoying , money-losing gridlock . It soon became clear that the Erie 's entire financial future rested on its ability to physically expand , just as the nearby Pennsylvania Railroad and Central Railroad of New Jersey had done years earlier with their open cuts . Competition between the railroad companies was very keen . The Erie , regarded as one of the most reliable and comfortable passenger lines in the country , had to expand in order to retain its envied prestige and reputation . Improvements in Jersey City would , therefore , define its future . | Bergen Arches \/ Erie Cut Postcard Courtesy of the Yost Collection | ... contractors are installing a comparatively new system for hoisting and conveying [ which ] has been used on the rapid transit subway construction in New York City , at the Devonport , England dock yards , and in the erection of the bridge over the Zambesi River at the Victoria Falls in South Africa The plant to be installed for the Bergen Hill excavation , however , is larger by far than any other ever made and involves some important features of novelty . | Bergen Arches \/ Erie Cut Postcard Courtesy of the Yost Collection | Using 250,000 pounds of dynamite to shape the mile - long cut and arches , workers blasted through 800,000 cubic yards of blue trap rock . 160,000 cubic yards of earth were excavated . Four short tunnels with widespread arched portals were blasted and chiseled out of the original Palisadian bluffs and faced with concrete made from the pulverized trap rock . The arched tunnels acted as natural bridges for the cobbled city streets that intersected high above the railbeds . Situated between these tunnels were soaring cuts that were \" open to the blue sky of heaven , \" as described in Men of Erie , thereby eliminating the coal smoke nuisance created by the old Bergen Tunnel . The open cuts were given a width of 60 feet at the base and 100 feet at the top . At certain points the depth of the vertical cliffs reaches 85 feet . The top edges of the cliffs were emblazoned with thick grass , draping flower beds and ornamental iron fencing , and adjacent city streets that looked down at the cut were beautifully landscaped at the expense of the Erie . The creation of this engineering marvel did not come without financial and human sacrifice . The project 's stupendous cost of five million dollars effectively curtailed the Erie 's plans to build a new monumental train and ferry terminal at the Jersey City waterfront . Scores of laborers lost their lives or were permanently maimed in the deep cut by roaring rock avalanches and accidental blasts , thereby crowding the City Hospital and morgue at taxpayer cost . Nearby residents suffered physical harm as well : boulders uplifted by dynamite whirled through the sky like stone seagulls and crashed through gabled roofs or landed in vined gardens . The Millard Construction Company , although revolutionary in construction techniques , practiced poor safety precautions . Lawsuits ensued . | Iron Erie Trestle ( far right ) Emerging from Erie Cut Courtesy of Jersey City Public Library | The Bergen Arches were opened to the public on June 13th , 1910 , nearly four years after construction began . Residents , elected officials and dignitaries watched as luxury passenger locomotives emerged from the cut 's expansive eastern portal atop the towering cliffs of the Palisades and spanned a colossal steel trestle that slowly dipped to grade level at the Jersey City waterfront several blocks down where the old Erie Terminal stood . The Jersey Journal reported the event in an extended story featured on its front page : After three years and eight months of unremitting work , which includes the customary delays that beset great engineering undertakings , the Erie Railroad Company has so far completed the task of constructing an open cut through Jersey City Heights the gigantic engineering feat is one of the greatest in the history of the Erie Railroad and of great importance , as it will afford the relief that has been needed for years as a result of the rapidly growing passenger traffic that has developed and continues to develop within fifty miles of New Yorkto the entire passenger service it means no more tunnel delays , no more closed windows , stifling atmosphere or artificial light , but a clean , wholesome ride for everybody and the elimination of the only passenger tunnel on the Erie Railroad between New York and Chicago . | Bergen Arches \/ Erie Cut Aerial Photo Copyright \u00a9 2000 Leon Yost | The Bergen Arches , a monumental engineering corridor that has contributed to Jersey City 's and New Jersey 's former prominence as a central railroad terminus , is the metropolitan area 's last remaining large railroad cut in its original form and splendor . The sheer sight of its astounding engineering elements conjures up an era of growth and prominence as dictated by the mighty Erie Railroad . Its battered folding cliffs and arcing concrete portals exist as reminders of brilliant engineers and laborers . Its narrow nave of cascading Palisadian rock erupts in the viewer 's eyes like a receding apparition . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Impactor\": [], \"Cause\": [], \"Place\": [\"through the vast Bergen Hill section of the Palisades , in Jersey City , New Jersey\"], \"Time\": [\"between 1906 - 1910\"], \"Impactors\": [\"250,000 pounds of dynamite\"], \"Agent\": [\"workers\"], \"Impactee\": [\"through 800,000 cubic yards of blue trap rock\"]}"}

Global Radio to halve number of local Heart stations , mediaguardian.co.uk , 21 June 2010 The new station , Heart Home Counties , began broadcasting from Dunstable on 16 July 2010 . Heart slims but strengthens , RadioToday , 21 June 2010 <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Global Radio is to cut in half the number of its local Heart stations in a reorganisation that will lead to the loss of up to 200 full - time and freelance posts . The overhaul , which was announced to staff today , will see the formation of 15 Heart \" super stations \" in place of the 33 currently run by Global . Two other local Global stations will also be subsumed under the Heart brand . These changes come after media regulator Ofcom announced newly - relaxed regulations on the output of local radio earlier this year . The 15 stations will have their own breakfast and drivetime shows , with all other programmes networked out of London as is currently the case . Local daytime news bulletins will be increased from 30 seconds to one minute every hour . It is understood the changes could affect up to 200 people , the majority of them on freelance contracts . It is thought between 30 and 40 permanent staff are likely to be affected . Global management is expected to decide over the next few weeks which 15 of the existing breakfast and drivetime shows will be retained across the newly - expanded networks . The company said it would spend \u00a3 7 m on the \" restructuring of personnel and investment \" in the changes , which will begin next month and are due to be completed by the end of the year . Ashley Tabor , the Global Radio founder and Global Group chief executive , said Ofcom 's regulatory change \" enables commercial radio to organise itself more efficiently and take advantage of new technology to enable our people to work smarter \" . \" Although this has meant some brave decisions for our business , these changes considerably strengthen our company by providing listeners with higher quality programming and our customers with a far superior service , \" Tabor added . In one of the biggest changes , five existing Heart stations in Devon will be turned into a single broadcaster run out of Exeter . Four more stations in Wales and the north - west of England will become Heart North - West and Wales , broadcasting out of Wrexham . Another new station , Heart Home Counties , will be made up of four Heart stations currently broadcasting from Northampton , Milton Keynes , Bedford and Dunstable . Two Global stations with different brands will also join the Heart stable of stations \u2013 Crawley - based Mercury FM , which will become part of Heart Sussex & Surrey , and Ten-17 FM in Harlow , which will join Heart Essex . The two Heart stations run separately from Global under licence , including Heart 106 in the east Midlands , will be unaffected by the changes . Heart was rolled out across the country as a brand as part of a generally successful three - stage relaunch of Global 's local stations last year .

The Kombucha Tea Starter Kit includes tea , sugar , a SCOBY , and vinegar to make choosing kombucha ingredients as easy as possible . Q. What is the process to make kombucha ? A. Making kombucha tea at home involves making tea , adding a starter culture ( SCOBY ) and letting it culture in a warm spot for 7 - 30 days . You can find instructions and a How - To Video on our page for How to Make Kombucha . Q. How long should I brew my kombucha ? A. Kombucha can be brewed from 7 to 30 days , depending on personal preference . A longer brewing time results in less sugar and a more vinegary - flavored beverage . Keep in mind that temperature will play a role in how quickly the kombucha cultures . Q. Can I use less sugar or alter any ingredients used to make kombucha ? A. We strongly recommend following the tea : sugar : water : starter tea ratios indicated in the instructions . These ratios encourage a proper balance , which discourages the growth of mold and the spoiling of the batch . It also helps ensure the SCOBY gets enough food to culture properly . Q. Can I use a plastic container to brew kombucha and plastic bottles to store it ? A. We recommend glass containers when working with starter cultures , because of the potential of plastic to leach undesirable chemicals . Additionally , plastic is more easily damaged , often without your knowledge , which can result in hidden bacteria that may disrupt the culturing process . Q. Can I culture my kombucha tea in a cupboard , or on a windowsill , etc .? A. Brewing kombucha tea in a cupboard is perfectly fine . However , do not put kombucha tea in sunlight . It is important to keep fermenting kombucha out of direct sunlight and away from excessive heat or cold . Q. Can I make kombucha without a starter tea ? A. Yes , you can use an equal portion of distilled white vinegar in place of starter tea . Alternatively you may use bottled raw , unflavored kombucha tea , which can be purchased at many health food and grocery stores . However , when activating a dehydrated scoby , use distilled white vinegar only . Q. I 'm brewing my first batch of kombucha using the dehydrated culture . It does n't seem to be doing anything . How can I know if it 's working properly ? A. Click here for Kombucha Scoby Activation Troubleshooting or contact Customer Support . Q. What signs should I look for to determine the kombucha is culturing properly ? A. A few good signs the kombucha fermentation process is proceeding normally include the formation of a new kombucha culture over the opening of the brewing container , development of brown stringy yeast particles , and the liquid becoming less sweet and more vinegar-like . NOTE : For the initial batch when using a dehydrated culture , there may be no visible signs of culturing . The best way to check progress of the brew is to test aroma and flavor . Q. If I 'm making other cultured foods ( yogurt , sourdough , kombucha , etc. ) , how far apart do I need to keep the cultures ? A. We suggest keeping a distance of at least 4 feet between items . When your cultured items are being stored in the refrigerator with tight - fitting lids , there is no need to keep distance between them . Q. Where can I view the instructions for making kombucha ? A. Click here to view the kombucha instructions . Caring for Your SCOBY Q. Will kombucha tea starters multiply ? A. Kombucha tea cultures multiply . Each time you brew a batch of Kombucha tea a new starter culture will form . The original starter culture ( \" the mother \" ) and the new starter culture ( \" the baby \" ) can each be used to brew a new batch of kombucha tea . Note : It may take several batches for a baby to form after initial rehydration . Q. My kombucha has been fermenting for a period of time and is developing a cloudy layer on top . Is this normal ? A. Yes . The cloudy white layer is the beginning of a new baby kombucha culture . The formation of a new culture is one sign that your batch of kombucha is fermenting properly . Q. My kombucha tea has been fermenting for a period of time and is developing brown stringy particles . Is this normal ? A. The brown stringy particles are yeast particles and are harmless . They are a natural byproduct of the fermentation process . You can strain them out of the finished kombucha if desired . Q. My kombucha culture sank to the bottom of my container , is floating sideways , rose to the top of the liquid , etc . Is this normal ? A. Depending on a number of factors , the culture may sink , float or sit sideways . Any of these is normal and will not affect the brewing process . Q. The new baby kombucha culture seems to have detached from the container opening . Will this affect the fermentation process ? A. Having the baby kombucha culture detach from the container opening does not affect the fermentation process . Q. I 've been storing a batch of finished kombucha for a few days and it seems to be developing a jelly - like mass on top . Is this normal ? What is it ? A. The jelly - like mass is the beginning of a new baby kombucha culture . Even after the main kombucha culture is removed , the kombucha remains full of living yeast and bacteria which continue to ferment slowly on their own . As a result , idle kombucha will eventually form a new baby culture . Q. One of my kombucha cultures has a hole in it or is split into pieces because I had to separate it from mother culture after they fused . Can I still use it ? A. Kombucha cultures will work just fine even with holes or if they have been torn in half . Q. Does the size of the kombucha culture matter in relation to how much kombucha I will be brewing ? A. No , even a small kombucha culture will effectively ferment a full gallon of kombucha . We recommend using a culture or a piece of a culture . The culture should be at least 3 inches in diameter . Q. I 've been brewing kombucha for awhile and am overrun with kombucha scobys . What can I do with them ? A. Do n't worry , there are lots of ways to use leftover scobys . Try on these creative ideas for using the extra scobys . Flavoring , Bottling , and Second Fermentation Q. How can I flavor my kombucha tea ? A. There are lots of ways to flavor kombucha tea ! In our how - to video on Flavoring and Bottling Kombucha we show you how to flavor and bottle your homemade kombucha tea , plus include our favorite kombucha flavor ideas ! Q. What ratio of juice to kombucha should I use for the second fermentation ( to add flavor ) ? A. For a second fermentation , a ratio of 20 % juice and 80 % kombucha generally works well . You can also experiment with other ratios to change the flavor . Q. How do I increase the carbonation of my kombucha tea ? A. Bottling kombucha in an airtight bottle helps to increase carbonation .

Linux kernel 2.6.26 and newer Permission - related mounting options <event> added <\/event> in 2.6.30 . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Linux 2.6.30 was released on the 9th of June , 2009 . Summary : This version adds the log-structured NILFS2 filesystem , a filesystem for object - based storage devices , a caching layer for local caching of NFS data , the RDS protocol which delivers high - performance reliable connections between the servers of a cluster , a distributed networking filesystem ( POHMELFS ) , automatic flushing of files on renames \/ truncates in ext3 , ext4 and btrfs , preliminary support for the 802.11 w drafts , support for the Microblaze architecture , the Tomoyo security module , DRM support for the Radeon R6xx \/ R7xx graphic cards , asynchronous scanning of devices and partitions for faster bootup , MD support for switching between raid 5\/6 modes , the preadv \/ pwritev syscalls , several new drivers and many other small improvements . Contributor : NTT Labs ( Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation ) NILFS2 is a new filesystem which uses a log-structured design . What makes log-structured filesystems different is that they treat the whole disk as a consecutive list of blocks ( called log ) . All the operations append data at the end of the log , they never rewrite blocks ( except when there 's no space left - in that case , new blocks are reclaimed from the start of the log ) . The advantage of this approach is that all modifications an creations are converted into sequential operations , which are faster . Crashes ca n't corrupt the filesystem . On mount , the filesystem detects the real end of the log , and continues working from that point . Another advantage of this approach is that the log offers a coherent historical view of all the operations done in the disk in the past . This is called \" continuous snapshotting \" - snapshots of modifications done in all the filesystem at any time are created automatically due to the log-structure design , with no requirement of intervention from an admin , and with the filesystem size as the only limit . NILFS2 allows to access those snapshots and even mount them ( on read - only mode ) . POHMELFS stands for Parallel Optimized Host Message Exchange Layered File System . It is a high performance and network distributed filesystem with ability to balance reading from multiple hosts and simultaneously write data to different remote nodes , with a local writeback cache of data and metadata , which greatly speeds up every IO operation . It beats NFS by a big margin in most , if not all , operations . You can find more details and benchmarks about it in its home page . POHMELFS is hosted in the \" staging \" section of the kernel code , although it 's already quite mature . Code : drivers \/ staging \/ pohmelfs \/ DST stands for Distributed ( network ) STorage . DST allows the creation of high - performance storage networks in a reliable and easy manner . DST allows to form a storage on top of local and remote nodes and combine them into linear or mirroring setup , which in turn can be exported to remote nodes , an equivalent of much of the functionality offered by the device mapper , iSCSI , and network block device ( NBD ) layers . It works on top of any network media and protocol . DST may fully encrypt the data channel in case of untrusted channel and implement strong checksum of the transferred data . DST is hosted in the \" staging \" section of the kernel code . Code : drivers \/ staging \/ dst \/ 1.3 . Reliable Datagram Sockets ( RDS ) protocol support RDS provides a high bandwidth , low latency , reliable inter-process communication protocol and transport system between the servers in a cluster . It provides a reliable connection between any two nodes in the cluster . This allows applications to use a single socket to talk to any other process in the cluster - so in a cluster with N processes you need N sockets , in contrast to N*N if you use a connection - oriented socket transport like TCP . In beta testing , RDS over infiniBand provided up to 60 percent performance improvement over Gigabit Ethernet for interconnect - intensive applications . RDS is already used by some products like Oracle and in Silverstorm 's Quicksilver . Some parts of the kernel boot process can delay the whole process too many time ( by kernel 's standards ) : scanning in search of storage devices for a given controller , and searching for partitions , for example , can be slow , because the scanning is synchronous , only one device is scanned at a time , and the kernel has to wait for the devices . With this feature , those steps are done asynchronously , so the kernel can keep booting the rest of the kernel while the storage devices are scanned in parallel . This feature speeds up the total kernel boot time significantly The IEEE 802.11 w standard is a proposed ( still not approved ) amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard ( wifi ) that increase the security of its management frames . In this version Linux adds a preliminary implementation for this future standard , developed according to the current drafts . Traditional storage devices offer a block - based interface . However , there 's a new generation of experimental storage devices that are trying to offload some work from the host , and offer a higher - level interface : an array of objects . The OS interfaces with the objects , and the drive hides all the storage details , removing most of the low-level details of the filesystem . A traditional filesystem can then be easily implemented on top of this interface . The OSD interface works on top of SCSI . In this release Linux adds support for the OSD protocol on the SCSI stack , and exofs , an implementation of a traditional unix filesystem that works on top of OSD storage devices . NFS 4.1 is being developed at the IETF . From the many new features in NFSv4.1 , this Linux version adds the mandatory - to - implement NFSv4.1 Sessions . Other features , Parallel NFS in particular , are still under development out of tree and will be added in later releases . To enable this experimental new protocol ( which is disabled by default ) you need an updated nfs-utils . FS - Cache is the Linux implementation of a cache layer for networking filesystems , similar to the CacheFS of other Unixes . With FS - Cache , data from the networked filesystems can be cached on the disk , speeding up operations . This version adds support for NFS and AFS , but it 's a generic layer that could be used by other networking filesystems or even non-networking ( such as ISO9660 ) . Shortly after the 2.6.29 release , lots of discussions occurred on LKML about disk I \/O ( summary available at LWN ) , how ( and why ) a fsync ( ) call can take minutes , and the effect of getting a file zeroed rebooting just after a rename or a truncate . Some changes have been done to fix those problems : implicit internal fsync of a file after a rename or truncate in ext3 , ext 4 and btrfs , faster fsync ( ) in ext3 , default to data=writeback mode in Ext3 , and improvements to CFQ . The flame has also brought the topic of atimes updates , and which has resulted into merging relatime and making it a default . 1.12 . LZMA \/ BZIP2 kernel image compression Contributor : Alain Knaff The kernel compresses the kernel with GZIP , but this version adds support to compress the kernel image with the LZMA or BZIP2 compression algorithms . The kernel size is about 10 per cent smaller with bzip2 in comparison to gzip , and about 33 per cent smaller with lzma . The Trusted Computing Group ( TCG ) runtime Integrity Measurement Architecture ( IMA ) maintains a list of hash values of executables and other sensitive system files , as they are read or executed . If an attacker manages to change the contents of an important system file being measured , we can tell . If your system has a TPM chip , then IMA also maintains an aggregate integrity value over this list inside the TPM hardware , so that the TPM can prove to a third party whether or not critical system files have been modified . percpu : implement new dynamic percpu allocator ( commit ) kmemtrace , a kernel memory tracer . kmemtrace provides tracing for slab allocator functions , such as kmalloc , kfree , kmem_cache_alloc , kmem_cache_free etc .. Collected data is then fed to the userspace application in order to analyze allocation hotspots , internal fragmentation and so on , making it possible to see how well an allocator performs , as well as debug and profile kernel code ( commit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ) loop : support barrier writes ( commit ) , add ioctl to resize a loop device ( commit ) ramfs : add support for \" mode= \" mount option ( commit ) udf : implement mode and dmode mounting options ( commit ) ipc namespaces : Implement multiple mounts of the mqueue file system , and link it to usage of CLONE_NEWIPC . Each ipc ns has a corresponding mqueuefs superblock . When a user does clone ( CLONE_NEWIPC ) or unshare ( CLONE_NEWIPC ) , the unshare will cause an internal mount of a new mqueuefs sb linked to the new ipc ns . When a user does ' mount -t mqueue mqueue \/ dev \/mqueue ' , he mounts the mqueuefs superblock ( commit ) , ( commit ) dynamic debug : combine dprintk and dynamic printk ( commit ) NOMMU : Make it possible for RomFS to use MTD devices directly ( commit ) 3 . PCI Single Root I\/O Virtualization ( SR - IOV ) support . SR - IOV is a PCI Express Extended capability which makes one physical device appear as multiple virtual devices . The physical device is referred to as Physical Function ( PF ) while the virtual devices are referred to as Virtual Functions ( VF ) ( commit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) nl 80211 : Event notifications for MLME events ( commit ) , add MLME primitives to support external SME ( commit ) 5 . Security SELinux Add new security mount option to indicate security label support .

Stewart Home , Re-Enter The Dragon . Genre Theory , Bruceploitation and the Sleazy Joys of Lowbrow Cinema . Leda Tape Organisation , 2018 . Stewart Home knows there are these things happening everywhere , all the time , throughout modern capitalist history , and Bruceploitation is a good way of showing what and how . His are the reflections not only of a certain personal attitude , stuffed with feelings and psychological vim , but a philosophical \u2013 explicitly Marxist \u2013 one as well . Reading Home can be a strange and electrifying experience , one tinged by the sense you 're reading works by a maniac writing towards the edge of an abyss that is more and more your own . His vision is unreconstructedly Marxist , his approach unrelenting and remorseless as he hunts down the capitalist program from within the repeater asskicking . He 's diagnosing the ways in which reason underdetermines belief , and appeals to a speculative psychological hypotheses to explain belief fixation even in the absence of rational evidence through deconstructing a set of carefully selected kung fu films . And importantly the work is a passionate affair . He 's driven by affection for the films which gives the work its authority and force as well its intensity and hilarious jouissance . It 's also swaggery too , well able to take care of itself . As he writes at the start : ' Others with different views will just have to argue their own corner . \u201c Your kung fu , sorry I mean bullshit theory , is pretty good \u2014 but it ca n't beat my trash cinema dialectics ! \u201d He 's not worried . This new book covers this wild landscape of a minor genre of pulp films that few readers will have seen or known about to the obsessive depth Home has , so the detail and fine - pointed nuances in selection reminds us that here 's a writer thinking about the point of uttering half - truths , about the existence of numbers , about mental content , about scientific laws and models , about the existence of fictional entities , like Tong Fu , and about metaphysical and logical impossibility without caring a toss whether we were interested in any of it the first place . ( Although he does reckon that if you 're reading the book you 're either interested in genre theory or action movies , or both . But it 's just as likely that you 're interested in Home and neither of the other things ! ) He 's going point to point so we can start learning up . In fact this kind of point- to - pointing is typical in Home , who often lays down detail after detail , even when his first is damning enough . The technique and approach he uses for capturing his phenomena is part of the curious feeling you often get when reading him that he 's strangling whatever it is in the cradle ; in his relentlessness you feel he 's using a cannon to kill a mouse , but that it misses the mouse to hit neighbouring mice instead . Deliberately . Home is out to cause trouble . Or what others might call fun . The publicity from Leda Tape sets the scene : ' HEAD KICKING BRICK BREAKING MAYHEM ! This is the first in - depth look at movies that riff on tropes associated with Bruce Lee and that sometimes transformed this actor into a mythical superman . The period with the greatest cluster of Brucesploitaton productions lasted less than a decade from the mid-seventies to the early - eighties , but the genre spluttered on into the twenty - first century ; and although it did n't exist as a category before Bruce Lee 's death , there are several films that pre-date the Little Dragon 's demise that clearly belong to it . While death added another dimension to Bruce Lee 's celebrity status , he was already a huge star in South East Asia before he passed away ; so cynical movie producers did not need to wait for his death to exploit popular interest in Lee \u2013 even if the term Brucesploitation had yet to be coined . Within Brucesploitation actors who copy and clone Bruce Lee make up one strand of the subgenre , but their importance can and has been over-stated . Much of the writing about Brucesploitation is fan and internet based , and many of those producing this discourse make little attempt to explain why they insist certain films belong to the genre . Too many fans write as if genre is somehow natural , rather than created and shaped both through bald assertion and by more critical discussion and thinking . It is all too common to find any martial arts film featuring certain actors and themes , or with Bruce in the title , being accepted as Brucesploitation without any debate around the issue . This book systematically explores the genre and controversially takes a close look at which flicks really should be seen as belonging to it . ' Bruceploitation as Home presents it feels like an entire species of semi-beloved and once deferred - to entities has been stolen away leaving behind only persistent appearances . 146 appearences to be precise . That 's how many films he covers in the book . It 's a stunning performance . He 's out to find the representational benefits of genre objects \u2013 like Adam West 's Batman tv series , The Men From Uncle , Atom Ant etc etc , \u2013 without needing to say that such things exist . Home works to liberate readers from the oppression of the values the reader accepts . Home 's Marxism says that these readers oppress themselves in virtue of certain values and norms they accept \u2013 the reality of genius , of originality , of art as an escape from the logic of capitalism and so forth \u2013 and Home offers his books as a kind of diagnostic to understand this oppressive character of modernity . Individuals are captured by judgments of normality telling them the ways of being a normal human being . These are the judgments that tell you what to eat , what jokes are funny , who to vote for , how to raise children , what to wear and so on . In the modern era the regulation of these judgments derives from human sciences . The authority trapping us all in its iron cage is epistemic and as well as the usual religious ones modernity has added scientific ones to hold us in too . Home is out to point out the cage , make sure we can see it and understand it . His strategy has been to cast light on the area of this modern oppression where the cage seems least strong \u2013 the arts \u2013 to show that aesthetics is no less part of the iron cage than shopping , managerialism , orthodox religions and the rest . The role of art as a liberator of the self , as a place where the antinomian rebel might go to wriggle free is taken down . His strategy is to show how wherever you want to go he can show you the tactics and influence of economics , politics and moral considerations that have led to whatever art form you care to examine . And in showing that they 've been co-opted and work effectively to maintain the modern capitalist structures that are ubiquitous and currently unassailable he bursts optimistic delusions that capitalism can be breached . Yet his books are not dry , drab and depressing reads but are injected with a zoomy sense of unstoppability which mirrors the system he 's fighting , as if he 's showing that pushback taken to a limit can be effective in beginning the resistance , no matter how big or small the perceived impact . After all , resistance has to start somewhere and for all we know each little crack may end up contributing to the end game . So the fun is in this serious agenda bashing up against a wild and prolonged discussion of a genre that , as he explains in the prologue , he first became attached to growing up in the sixties and seventies . ' As a kid I watched the Batman TV series so it is probable I was exposed to Bruce Lee 's guest appearances as Kato before I learnt he was the ' king of kung fu' . There were many things to prep my interest in Lee but probably just feeling angry and disempowered was the most important factor . Constantly having teachers tell me and all the other kids at school that we were stupid and would never do anything with our lives \u2014 other than work in a factory \u2014 was more than enough to make me want to breakout from such drab surroundings . ' This is a typical Home moment mixing personal reminiscence with the underlying anger and resentment that animates his whole oeuvre . Bruce Lee 's kung fu movies and the Bruceploitation movies that followed were , he explains , a form of escape from the dismal limits of childhood . As he writes , ' Music was one way to escape this sham reality , but by the time I was twelve years - old glam rock was on its last legs , so martial arts flicks filled a void by providing a better form of contemporary escapism \u2014 at least until punk rock came along . ' One of the great things about the book is that Home writes about how he got into the films and how his motivations have threaded through his subsequent works in the many arenas in which he works \u2013 novels , conceptual art , poetry , essays , performance art , lectures , music and so forth . You get riffs like this which paint a picture of the young Home making his way into the deep waters of contemporary modernity which are fascinating for their insight into a time now fast becoming difficult to imagine for anyone of a certain age , a world without the internet , computers , mobile phones and the whole digital media paraphernalia . It 's the world on the brink of hyper- capitalism , the world that had since the 30 's seemed to be a world where perhaps capitalist logic could be tamed and defanged . The time from the 30's to the end of the 70's was the only time in recorded history where average returns on work outperformed average returns on capital in western capitalist societies . It was a period where it looked as if we were living in a different modernity to the one that had been in place ever since the French Revolution where capital always made more than work . Alas , it was n't to last . By the time the seventies had ended we were returning to the norm of the previous few hundred years . Of course now it seems obvious that capitalists \u2013 a tiny portion of the population \u2013 own the world , and that we 're stuck in our own version of the belle \u00e9poque but back then it was n't so obvious . This is of course the important message from Picketty 's book on Capital . The low tech , ziney world of the seventies is where Home 's affection and interest for these flicks began , and his asides catch the different atmosphere of those lost times . Take this riff : ' I first took a conscious interest in Bruce Lee when the London based Kung Fu Monthly began publication in 1974 . This was a fan magazine that turned into a giant fold - out poster . After seeing early issues I was desperate to catch the Little Dragon 's flicks . More than anything else in Kung Fu Monthly I found a picture of Bruce in his coffin morbidly fascinating since it was in such contrast to the other images of him as a seemingly super-fit movie star . Since I was n't old enough to see X-rated films , I had to lie about my age to gain admittance to Enter the Dragon ( 1973 ) and innumerable other martial arts movies . When I first saw Lee ' <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Agent\": [], \"Time\": [], \"Place\": [], \"Cause\": [\"Genre Theory , Bruceploitation and the Sleazy Joys of Lowbrow Cinema\"], \"Patient\": [\"the contours of the category of Bruceploitation\"]}"}

Boston had two such cases around the turn of the 20th century . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Boston Daily Globe July 26 , 1899 Typhoid Fever In Jamaica Plain Three New Cases Reported Today , Making 24 Since July 14 - Milkman Taken in Hand by Health Department . The board of health has discovered a serious typhoid epidemic at Jamaica Plain . Since July 14 there have been 24 cases of typhoid fever , six of which were reported on the 20th , five on the 17th , and five Monday . There were three new cases yesterday from the same section . These cases are in homes furnished with milk by a man who has 300 customers and by another milkman who has been taking two cans of milk form the first-mentioned milkman . Dr. O'Shea of the health department , with inspectors , has gone to the bottom of the matter . On July 14 this group of cases started , and , as in every other case of typhoid fever , a thorough investigation of the cases is made with special reference to the milk and water supply , the house drainage plumbing , etc . As other cases were investigated they were found to be in families who had been taking milk from the same man . The farm was visited and was found to be an old place . The wife of the milkman died of typhoid fever last week , and while sick and on her feet attended to the various duties of the milk farm , the washing of cans , etc . The drain from the sink and the outhouse was into the cellar of the barn , where about two feet of water was found , and a very short distance from the barn was an old well , the water of which was not good enough to drink , but which , it is stated , was used to wash the milk cans . The milkman was in consultation with the board of health Monday , and was told in the plainest language what was expected of him in the future , and was instructed as to the handling of his milk . Dr Durgin states that all cows and the milk plant have been removed to safe quarters . The old premises have been thouroughly disinfected and the requirements of the board of health regarding the storage of milk and the care of the cans must be strictly adhered to . Under the new law this milkman , until he has conformed to the board of health 's regulations , will not be allowed to distribute his milk in this city . Boston Daily Globe April 11 , 1908 Typhoid Traced . Milkman , Himself Victim , Spread Disease . J.J. Fallon Worked a Fortnight Without Suspecting Illness . The board of health yesterday traced the spread of typhoid fever in Jamaica Plain to John J. Fallon of 236 Lamartine st , a milk distributor in that section , who died early yesterday morning . The autopsy made on the body by medical examiner Magrath , assisted by Dr Shea of the board of health , revealed the fact that Mr Fallon was suffering from the disease as early as March 15 or earlier . The board issued the following statement last night : \" It is now in full evidence that a man who died today of typhoid fever in Jamaica Plain was suffering from this disease as early as March 15 or earlier , during which time he was at work daily testing and otherwise handling the milk supply which we have been suspecting since April 2 . This man not only could have infected the said milk , but most likely did contiuously for a period of at least the last half of March , having been at work handling the milk in question until March 30 without suspecting his illness . \" The first suspicion of typhoid fever in this case was on April 2 and it was reported April 3 . His premises , utensils and employees were all carefully examined , attended to and his source of milk supply changed . \" The health department has no reason to suspect infection in the present milk supply in Jamaica Plain . \" It may be said that there are now , as usual , other scattered cases of this disease about the city , and although the board does not think they have arisen from the same source they are all under investigation . \" The total number of cases of typhoid fever reported to the board of health up to last night from Jamaica Plain since March 31 was 237 , of which seven were reported since 9 a.m . The number for the preceeding 9 a.m. was 20 , or one less than the number of the day before . A second victim of typhoid fever in Jamaica Plain yesterday was Mrs Sophia S Engstrom , aged 46 , of 10 Plainfield st , who died at the City hospital at 3 o'clock yesterday morning . She leaves a husband and one son . Mr Fallon was 43 years old . he leaves a wife , one son and a daughter . Boston Daily Globe April 14 , 1908 Think Worst Is Over Health Officials Take Hopeful View of Typhoid Epidemic . The health officials believe that the worst of the typhoid epidemic is over . At Jamaica Plain there is a slight increase , the total being 272 cases . Throughout the city there is a total of 348 cases . Boston Daily Globe May 8 , 1908 To Seven Families . Typhoid Has Brought Death in Jamaica Plain . No Less Than 40 Patients From District in City Hospital . The typhoid fever epidemic that is rating in Jamaica Plain has brought death to no less than seven well - known families of that district , and there are at least 10 patients in the City hospital at present . On April 10 Frank and Lucy McGraw of 20 St Rose st , Jamaica Plain , were taken to the City hospital . When they entered Lucy McGraw was by far in the worse condition of the two . On Friday of that week , three days after he entered the hospital , McGraw took a change for the worse and died the next day . April 12 Michael O' Keefe and Edward O'Keefe of 29 St Rose st , Jamaica Plain , were taken to the hospital . Two days later , Michael was placed on the dangerous list , but his condition improved , and today he is getting along nicely . Edward , however , whom the doctors expected would be out shortly after his entrance to the hospital , developed peritonitis and died . He died one week after his chum McGraw . To add to the trouble of the O'Keefe family two more children were taken to the City hospital two days after the first two . Robert Jr and Agnes are at present on the road to recovery . None of the three surviving O'Keefe children are aware of the fact that Edward is dead . Lucy McGraw is still under the impression that her brother Frank is living and asks for him daily . The Cullen family of Jamaica Plain are also hit hard by the disease , two sons , Frank and Fred , entering the institution the same day . Frank , the older of the two , died three weeks after entering the hospital . One of the saddest cases of the epidemic was that of James Gaffney , a well - known stableman of the district . Mr Gaffney became ill during the early stages of the epidemic and was taken to the City hospital . His condition was dangerous from the first . While he was in the hospital his little daughter was stricken , but was treated at their home on Sylvia st . The day after she died at her home Mr Gaffney passed away at the hospital . Joseph Becker , aged 14 , living on Green st , Jamaica Plain , died at the home of his parents after an illness of about two weeks . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Place\": [\"Jamaica Plain\"], \"Time\": [\"Today , Making 24 Since July 14\"], \"Agent\": [\"The wife of the milkman\", \"The milkman\"], \"Cause\": [\"The drain from the sink and the outhouse was into the cellar of the barn , where about two feet of water was found , and a very short distance from the barn was an old well ,\"], \"Liquid\": [\"an old well , the water of which\"], \"Patient\": [\"the milk cans\"]}"}

American Ambassador Woody Johnson 's comment to Andrew Marr on Sunday that healthcare would need to be on the table in any future trade talks only served to make agreeing a fully - fledged deal all the more difficult . That the US will drive a hard bargain in any future negotiation with the UK should come as no surprise . Only the EU , and perhaps China , have the economic heft to negotiate on near- level terms with the Americans , and even they struggle . The US 's objectives for its negotiation with the UK were published in February and \u2014 with the caveat that they were largely produced for a domestic American audience , shorn of all notion of compromise \u2014 are strikingly ambitious in their demands . For example : alongside normal talk of tariff and quota removal , the UK must jettison food hygiene rules that currently restrict US exports of beef , pork , chicken and dairy ; rules stipulating which products qualify for tariff - free treatment under the agreements must specifically incentivise production on US territory ; and the agreement should include a mechanism allowing for the US to take appropriate action if the UK negotiates an agreement with a \u201c non - market economy \u201d ( see : China ) . It should be noted , however , that healthcare is not explicitly mentioned . Despite long - running fears of a US trade deal- inspired privatisation of the National Health Service , public services are largely carved out of free trade agreements , and that is unlikely to change . Absent a free trade agreement , American healthcare providers already compete to deliver services in the UK where the NHS puts out contracts to competitive tender . This is not without its own controversy , but was a unilateral decision made by a British government seeking value for money . However , US demands regarding reimbursement regimes for pharmaceuticals and medical devices give greater cause for thought . The US has long taken issue with the fact that the NHS 's approach to drug procurement \u2014 where it makes its own assessment as to the fair value of the drugs it buys \u2014 pulls down prices worldwide . Previously , in negotiations with Australia and New Zealand , the US backed away from trade asks on drug pricing in order to get agreements over the line , but due to the NHS 's global significance and market power , the incentives for the US to push the UK harder are more pronounced . Regardless , perception is more important than reality when it comes to selling an agreement , and so long as the British public believe the NHS to be on the table any deal will struggle for legitimacy . In practice , we will not know whether the UK will be in a position to even begin negotiations with the US until at least the end of October . Without greater clarity on the nature of the UK 's future relationship with the EU , it is impossible to enter into substantive discussions with the US . This is because any relationship with the EU comprehensive enough to ensure an all - UK solution for Northern Ireland , for example , would greatly restrict the UK 's ability to concede to the US 's demands and get an agreement over the line . Yet even if the UK is to enter into a looser economic relationship with the EU following an ordered withdrawal , we should not assume that a deal with the US will be easy to come by . Agriculture remains a contentious sticking point and Conservative fears of upsetting their rural base will be difficult to overcome . Equally , stories of US chlorinated chicken and hormone beef have already permeated the public consciousness . While Trump could agree to a bare - boned agreement that excludes agriculture and controversial topics such as food safety and drug pricing , just to say he had successfully negotiated something , it seems unlikely . The UK is not the end - game for the US . Its ultimate ambition is to open up the bigger EU market . For the UK to move to a more American approach would set a regional precedent , grant the US a regulatory foothold in the EU 's backyard , and push back against the EU 's increasingly global regulatory hegemony . Perhaps the only event that could cajole MPs and the British public into holding their noses and signing on Trump 's dotted line is a no-deal Brexit . The subsequent upheaval and economic uncertainty of no-deal would likely see the UK grasping for anything that looks like an economic lifeline . ( Although there is no reason to think that a trade deal with the US would come close to offsetting the negative economic shock of any kind of Brexit . ) This might also part-explain Trump 's propensity to talk up no-deal . Yet British MPs pining for such an outcome should think twice . Trump is not to be trusted . Just see what happened with Mexico : even though it recently agreed to a revamp of its existing trade agreement with the US and Canada , Trump has now threatened to levy a 5 per cent tariff on all Mexican exports to the US unless illegal immigration comes to a halt . Even if a no-deal Brexit does happen , and a lopsided US - UK free trade agreement is concluded , Trump may immediately come back asking for more .

For the price of 20 000 talars , the Cossack - Tatar forces decided to <event> end <\/event> the siege and returned home for the winter . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> | | 1648 to 1655 ( links to map of Poland ) The First Cossack War In 1648 the Cossacks rebelled again . This time they had a leader equal to the task in Chmielniecki . On news of the disturbances in the Sich Polish commander Nicholas Potocki set out for the Ukraine and in February 1648 he camped at Korsun . He sent part of his force ( 3 - 3,500 ) comprising regular troops and registered Cossacks to meet Chmielniecki ( 10,000 ) , which they did at Zlote Wody ( Yellow Waters ) . For the first time the Cossacks had allied themselves with the Tartars and together they formed a formidable fighting force . The mainly Cossack infantry now had a superb mobile cavalry arm while the solely cavalry Tartars had the assistance of the Cossacks defensive firepower . The Poles on the other hand lacked a commander of the stature of the recently deceased Koniecpolski . At Zlote Wody the registered Cossacks deserted the Royal army and in the ensuing confusion the remaining forces were destroyed on 15th May 1648 . Eleven days later the main Polish army was defeated at Korsun and as news spread of these victories the whole of the Ukraine rose in rebellion . When he was most needed , the much respected , King Wladyslaw IV died and with the Royal commanders captured or killed Poland was without a leader . Fortunately for Poland Chmielniecki delayed while he organised his forces and his country , while the booty laden Tartars returned home . In September 1648 Chmielniecki moved further into Poland . With both Hetman 's Potocki and Kalinowski captured , the Polish forces , though substantial , were ill disciplined and badly led by a group of three and defeated at Pilawce ( 10 to 23 October 1648 ) . The improvised cavalry failed to make any impression on the masses of Cossack infantry supported by the skillful Tartars . The few regular infantry which had survived Zlote Wody and Korsun ( King 's guard regiment and ' Wybraniecka ' infantry ) did however acquit themselves well , defending the river crossings with great courage before being overwhelmed . It was a great material and morale catastrophe , and a pathetic military display . One Cossack commander noted \" these were not the Poles we knew , the victors over the Turks and Muscovites , of Tartars and Germans , but cowards and rabbits , children clad in steel . They died of fright when they saw us \" . Chmielniecki then besieged Lvov and after receiving a ransom moved on to Zamosc , but the impregnable fortress held and the Cossacks returned home for the winter . Large numbers of peasants joined the Cossack army and with the Tartars they ravaged the land ' with fire and sword ' slaughtering nobles , Polish or Ruthenian , priests and nuns and Jews in their thousands . The Tartars taught their Cossack allies many lessons in cruelty including the Moldavian custom of impaling alive , which was carried out with relish by Cossacks and Poles alike . No one was in control on either side and the whole region degenerated into mindless violence and cruelty . In Warsaw Jan Kazimierz ( John Casimir ) half - brother of Wladyslaw was elected King . The coronation Sejm of 1649 enlarged the standing army , placing its financing partly on provinces of Poland and ended the registering of Cossacks . In June 1649 the Cossacks recommenced military operations when their Tartar allies returned . Polish forces retreated to the fortified camp of Zbaraz ( 10 July to 25 August 1649 ) where a relatively small force of some 9,000 Polish troops held back the entire might of Chmielniecki and the Khan for over six weeks . The new king moved to assist but was met by Chmielniecki 's main forces in a hard and indecisive two day battle at Zborow ( 15 - 16 August 1649 ) . The Poles succeeded in buying off the Khan and with Lithuanian forces operating in the East a truce was reached which included a general amnesty . The Second Cossack War Chmielniecki spent the next year maintaining the peace while making preparations for the inevitable continuation of war . He managed to raise an army of over 100,000 Cossacks had political support from Turkey and military support from the Crimean Tartars . He also hoped his rebellion , which had taken over the Ukraine , would spread to the peasants in Poland . The Sejm agreed to the raising of a 36,000 Royal and 15,000 Lithuanian army , giving the King the authority to raise the levy . While Polish forces were concentrating Hetman Kalinowski managed to loose half of his 12,000 force in operations to shield the main army . In June 1651 the Khan Islam Giereja rejoined the Cossacks and together they marched at the Polish forces . At the three day battle of Beresteczko ( 28 to 30 June 1651 ) the Royal army ( 27,000 mercenaries and 30,000 noble levy ) achieved a decisive victory and the Cossack - Tartar army ( 60 - 80,000 Cossacks and 20 - 30,000 Tartars ) retreated back to the Dniepr . Again the noble levy cavalry showed their poor discipline with the infantry saving the day and then ensuring a decisive defeat was inflicted on the enemy . After the battle the noble levy , deciding their duty was completed , dispersed while the remaining forces moved towards the Ukraine and joined up with the equally victorious Lithuanian army . Hetman Kalinowski , with complete victory within his grasp agreed to a truce . Peace was agreed in September at Biala Cerkiew , however it was even less successful than that agreed at Zborow . The Poles carried out punitive expeditions against the Ukraine while Chmielniecki punished with death the leaders of peasant riots . In 1652 the Great Cossack Council renewed hostilities with Poland and sent envoys to the Tsar and Khan for assistance . On 2 June 1652 Hetman Kalinowski attempted to head off Chmielniecki 's move to Moldavia but was defeated at Batoh . After the battle the Cossacks paid the Tartars to give them their share of the prisoners so that they could be killed , amoungst the dead was the brother of the future King Jan Sobieski , Marek . After a short vain siege of Kamieniec Podolski the Cossack - Tartar army returned home to seek further allies . Batoh led to a new 36,000 army with a much-reorganised financial base , making forces easier to raise and maintain , the Kwarta tax was used to maintain the artillery and fortifications . New financing gave the name ' computed ' for the regular army . The noble levy remained as a last resort and there were periodic mobilisations and exercises . Although the new system was by no means perfect it gave the Commonwealth a powerful army and was a natural evolution from a mainly mercenary to standing army . The Cossack wars continued and on 18th January 1654 Chmielniecki submitted the Ukraine to the ' Tsars hand ' and Muscovy invaded Poland and Lithuania . This was in violation of the Treaty of 1634 and Jan Kazimierz sent deputations to the Sultan and the Khan for assistance against the Tsar . The Ottomans allowed a Tartar alliance with the Poles , while the Sejm of June 1654 raised noble levies of 35,000 for Poland and 18,000 for Lithuania . Start of the Muscovite Wars The Muscovite army attacked with three groups at Lithuania and one at the Ukraine . The Muscovite army was numerous and well equipped and now trained mainly in the Western manner with many foreign officers . In Lithuania they were briefly checked by Janusz Radziwill 's small force , before pushing on to Smolensk . The winter halted further operations . In the Ukraine the Polish - Tartar army met the Cossack - Muscovite army at Ochmatow ( January 1655 ) and though the Muscovite forces were broken a decisive result slipped from the Poles when the Tartars refused to fight the Cossacks . In the Summer of 1655 a new Muscovite army reached Wilno and in two weeks turned the vibrant capital into a heap of ashes , but another even more dangerous enemy appeared . 5 <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"State\": [], \"Process\": [\"battle at Zborow\"], \"Place\": [\"Zborow\"], \"Time\": [\"16 August 1649\"], \"Agent\": [\"The Poles\"], \"Cause\": [\"in buying off the Khan\"]}"}

The KFOR troops said KLA rebels vandalized centuries - old murals and paintings in the chapel and stole two cars and all the monastery 's food . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> KLA rebels accused of vandalizing Serb monastery KFOR tries to stem Serb civilian exodus June 17 , 1999 PRISTINA , Yugoslavia ( CNN ) -- KFOR peacekeepers in Kosovo found themselves trying to deter reprisals against Serbs Thursday , as ethnic Albanian rebels were accused of desecrating a Serbian Orthodox monastery and assaulting a nun . Despite the incidents reported by French troops , the peacekeepers sought to reassure nervous Serbs they could protect them . The monastery is in Srbica , about 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) west of Pristina . KFOR spokesmen said Thursday the withdrawal of Yugoslav troops from the Serbian province was proceeding ahead of schedule . But the shrine 's desecration could hurt KFOR 's attempt to prevent a second flood of refugees from Kosovo -- this time , from Serb neighborhoods . French peacekeepers put the Devic monastery under guard after they said Kosovo Liberation Army fighters terrorized a priest and several nuns for four days , from Sunday to Wednesday . The KFOR troops said KLA rebels vandalized centuries - old murals and paintings in the chapel and stole two cars and all the monastery 's food . In addition , a French soldier said , the KLA stripped the clothes from a young nun and took her into a back room . The soldier said she was hysterical and appeared to be traumatized when she was found . When asked if the woman had been raped , the French soldier responded to CNN , \" What do you think ? \" The 15th - century monastery is one of the shrines from which the Serbian nation draws its cultural identity . Part of the agreement that ended NATO 's 11 - week bombing campaign provides for a handful of Yugoslav troops to return to the province later to protect sites like Devic . About 15,000 troops from NATO countries have gone into Kosovo since the end of fighting a week ago , said Lt. Col. Robin Clifford , KFOR 's spokesman in Pristina . At the same time , 35,000 Yugoslav army and Serb special police troops have left . That puts them ahead of the schedule set by the cease - fire agreement , which demands that all Yugoslav troops leave Kosovo by midnight Sunday . Fearing reprisals from the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians driven out during NATO 's air war against Yugoslavia , about 50,000 Serbs already have fled the province as their former neighbors return . KFOR commander Lt. Gen. Mike Jackson and Serbian Orthodox leader Patriarch Pavle have urged them to stay , and Clifford said the Serb exodus had slowed . KFOR will protect \" all the ordinary , decent citizens of Kosovo , regardless of their ethnic background or religious persuasion , \" Clifford said . \" I have also spoken to those who say they are perfectly content to say here , certainly those here in Pristina , as long as KFOR troops are here to protect them , \" he said . KFOR troops have had several encounters with the KLA , including one Wednesday in which U.S. Marines disarmed a group of 16 guerrillas . The newest reports of KLA anti-Serb activities came as reports surfaced of a possible agreement among rebel leaders to lay down their arms . Clifford said he could not comment on any possible agreement with the KLA , but said , \" We view any actions by the KLA -- or any other armed bands of paramilitaries or armed groups that cause friction or raise tensions -- as being entirely unacceptable . \" Pavle planned to stay in Pec , in southern Kosovo , in an effort to reassure Serbs and convince them to remain in the region Serbs consider the cradle of their society . But Pec was largely a ghost town Thursday , with only about 200 of its prewar population of 90,000 remaining . During the war , NATO accused Serb-led troops of carrying out a campaign of terror against ethnic Albanian civilians , and Kosovo Albanians are now bringing numerous graves to the attention of NATO troops and news organizations . In a village near Pec , residents showed CNN a site where they said 35 people were killed by Serb forces . The villagers said that on May 14 , Yugoslav troops herded the men into four houses and set them on fire . Three men lived to tell the story , and Italian troops secured the grave sites for international investigators . British officials said as many as 10,000 ethnic Albanians may have been killed in Kosovo , their remains buried at more than 100 sites . Clifford acknowledged the discoveries , but stopped short of attributing them entirely to massacres . \" Let 's not forget there has been a war here , and people die in wars and people are buried in wars , \" he said . In addition to grave sites , British troops participating in the KFOR peacekeeping mission have discovered what Foreign Office Minister Geoff Hoon called a torture center in the cellar of Serbia 's special police headquarters in Pristina , Kosovo 's provincial capital . And as Yugoslav troops leave Kosovo , they are burning houses and occasionally shooting people as they go , said Adm . Ian Garnett , Britain 's chief of joint operations . In the last days of the war , a U.N. tribunal charged Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and four top officials with war crimes in connection with the violence in Kosovo . Correspondents Richard Blystone , Mike Boettcher and Jim Clancy contributed to this report .

Dr Napthine on Monday confirmed reports that the state government was looking at alternative options for the Melbourne Metro rail tunnel . It had originally been planned to run from Kensington to Parkville , continue under Swanston Street with two CBD stations , then to the Domain Interchange and join at South Yarra station . The Premier said the government was still committed to building a rail project to increase capacity on the state 's passenger and freight rail networks . \" We have a lot of options on the table , the original Metro rail capacity project had raised some challenges , particularly the proposal in that project of having Swanston Street closed for two years plus , and completely dug up , \" he said . Under the current plan , Swanston Street would be ripped up to build the rail line with a \" cut - and - fill \" technique , with engineers saying it was the best and most appropriate way to build the railway . \" I 'm only a humble citizen of Melbourne and Victoria , but having a massive hole dividing Melbourne would be worse than the Berlin Wall ; it would be absolutely detrimental to the operation of Melbourne , \" Dr Napthine said . \" It would be an absolute disaster for Melbourne . \" The project has several problems including \" very sloppy \" ground south of the Yarra , compared to the strong basalt north of the river , making construction difficult . He said CityLink had special \" floating tunnels \" because the quality of the ground was better , adding there had been 600 bore holes for testing completed for the project , many more than those done for the east - west link . The Sunday Age reported that the project would cost $ 11.6 billion , but Dr Napthine said it was premature to put a cost estimate on rail project . The report said that some stations may be removed from the project , with a station at Fishermans Bend possibly being included in the scheme . The premier said any changes were in the early part of consideration , saying it would be irresponsible not to consider all ideas . Dr Napthine failed to say if the final design would be known before the November 29 election , other than to say the project was part of the government 's infrastructure plan and the timeline to deliver it in \" the back - half of this decade \" remained . Meanwhile , the premier has denied suggestions that there would be a ministerial reshuffle this week while parliament was in session . He said there would be \" minor adjustments \" made soon , after three ministers announced they would not contest November 's state election . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Pieces\": [], \"Time\": [\"for at least two years\"], \"Agent\": [\"the Melbourne Metro rail project\"], \"Whole_patient\": [\"Melbourne\"], \"Cause\": [\"of having Swanston Street closed for two years plus , and completely dug up\"], \"Place\": [\"Swanston Street\"]}"}

From pregame rituals to rivalry games , from marching bands to student section chants , it 's a level of sports unrivaled in passion . The FCS is no different . Programs rich in history are proud of the traditions they 've established . HERO Sports asked around and also scoured the internet for some of the best in the FCS . What we found are traditions that range from new to old , from humorous and quirky to something that sends chills down your spine and puts a lump in your throat . Here are the best traditions in the FCS with a Top 10 ranking at the bottom : NOTE : This article was originally published in 2018 and has been re-published in 2021 after the link broke . Many of these traditions were submitted by fans , administration , or coaches . Because of that , there are sure to be some missing . If you feel one deserves to be mentioned , email sam.herder@herosports.com and we 'll consider adding it . New Hampshire The Cannon Man Dick Dewing , who graduated in 1953 and is a UNH football Hall of Famer , fired a Revolutionary War-era cannon at home games for years , and did so into the 2019 season at the age of 91 . Dressed in full regalia and with his full crew , a blank shot is fired from the cannon at the beginning of the game , after the marching band plays \u201c 1812 Overture \u201d and after every Wildcats touchdown . Dewing passed away in April 2021 , but the tradition will continue . Todd Walker Teammate Award UNH has another special tradition with the Todd Walker Teammate Award . Walker , a former receiver for the Wildcats , was shot and killed in 2011 when he stopped an attempted robbery and saved the life of a woman he was walking home . The award was created to honor his memory and recognize a player who displays the attributes of selflessness and dedication as the ideal teammate . Delaware Tubby Raymond 's Paintings Harold \u201c Tubby \u201d Raymond was a Delaware assistant coach beginning in 1954 and was the head coach from 1966-2001 , winning 300 games and three national championships . In the 1950s , Raymond began to do acrylic paintings of a senior member of the team each week during the season for most of his coaching career at Delaware . He continued to do the paintings all the way up to the 2017 season until he passed away in December . Raymond was 92 . \u201c These portraits were a treasure to all of us , \u201d Joe Purzycki , a 1969 captain , said . McNeese \u201c Jolie Blond \u201d After each touchdown , the band plays the Cajun National Anthem , Jolie Blonde . The entire stadium dances to it , swaying to the left and clapping twice , swaying right and clapping twice , and so on and so on . Firing the Cannon After the Cowboys score a touchdown , a cannon is fired by Cannon Krewe members , who dress in full costume attire . It 's a strong tradition not only for the football team but for Southwest Louisiana as a whole . The history of pirates , contraband , buccaneers , and cannon fire can be found on street names , at festivals , and within the deep treasuries of local family tales and stories . The Cannon Krewe consists of at least 10 - 12 members for every game . When the Cowboys win , the cannons are fired strategically right when the scoreboard hits zero . If the team loses , the cannons are discharged only after the band plays the McNeese Alma Mater . Kennesaw State Turnover Plank Several college football teams celebrate with some sort of prop after the defense forces a turnover . Kennesaw State has \u201c Plank , \u201d which went viral in its debut season in 2017 . Simply a piece of wood with a smiley face on it that was originally found in Florida on spring break , Plank is still a point of pride for the defense to hold up on the sidelines . Idaho American Flag Every time the Idaho football team runs onto the field , they make sure a player is carrying the American flag . This started under former head coach Robb Akey after he took a trip to Afghanistan . The Vandals still run out with the flag under current head coach Paul Petrino . Ring the Bell Idaho has another tradition inside the walls of its facilities and uses it as a rallying call with \u201c Ring the Bell . \u201d Every time the bell is rung in the weight room , it signifies a player has hit his personal best . The Serpentine Add another tradition for Idaho , one that the students love . On the night before the homecoming football game , students form a serpentine led by the marching band that snakes across campus and picks people up on the way to a bonfire and pep rally . Originally , freshmen were tasked with gathering materials for the fire . Now , it is constructed by the homecoming committee . The serpentine has been an annual event for more than 100 years . Montana State Gold Rush Game Montana State has one of the best home venues in FCS football . The Bobcats make it extra special during the first home game of the year with the Gold Rush Game . The fans all wear gold and the team wears its gold jerseys . If the first home game is also the season opener , it 's usually held on a Thursday night under the lights . Cat Prowl Another cool tradition for MSU is the Cat Prowl an hour before kickoff . Cheerleaders and the marching band lead the football team to the stadium through a tunnel of fans . Before entering the stadium , players touch a 9 - foot statute of Sonny Holland , known as the \u201c the greatest Bobcat of them all . \u201d The statue debuted in 2016 . Holland was a three - time All -American and also won 47 games in seven years as a head coach , winning the 1976 Division II national championship . And the big stat is going 10 - 1 against Montana . Colgate Cake Wednesday Former Raiders head coach Dick Biddle told his players , \u201c Do n't be cake eaters . \u201d In other words , \u201c do n't be soft . \u201d In 2012 , Biddle brought in an actual cake with frosting that said , \u201c Do n't be cake eaters . \u201d This took place on a Wednesday and the team won that Saturday . It 's now turned into a tradition with cake in the locker room after every Wednesday practice . Samford Charles Williams Memorial Jersey In 2003 , Samford defensive back Charles Williams was killed in a car accident . An extremely well - respected man by his teammates and coaches , it was decided that no player would wear his No. 5 during the 2003 and 2004 seasons . In 2005 , the first Charles Williams Memorial Jersey was awarded to a senior who had the same qualities as Williams : selflessness , perseverance , and determination . The jersey number has been given to a senior every season since . Jacksonville State \u201c I'll Fly Away \u201d This has been sung by the JSU Marching Southerners for decades . A few years ago , the football team began to join in on the tradition . After games , the Southerners gather , put their arms around each other and sing it with the fans and players . Chattanooga Singing the Alma Mater A lot of football teams sing the school 's alma mater after games with the band . But how Chattanooga began this tradition is a little more unique . In 2009 , UTC fans pointed out on the message boards that Wofford stopped in the middle of the field after the game to watch the band play the UTC alma mater while the Chattanooga players ran to the locker room . Bob Mulkey , an admin on the message boards , brought it up to then - head coach Russ Huesman as part of the \u201c question of the week . \u201d Huesman acknowledged it and since then the football team remains on the field during the alma mater and the words appear on the video boards . Northern Arizona , Northern Colorado , Western Carolina The Freshmen Run At the beginning of every season , the freshmen class runs across the football field from end zone to end zone . Known FCS schools to do this are Northern Arizona , Northern Colorado , and Western Carolina . ( James Madison also does this , but has another well - known tradition that will be on this list . ) WCU 's tradition had a special twist with beloved chancellor David Belcher leading the freshmen during his seven years at the school . Belcher , known as the biggest fan of every sport \/ athlete at WCU , passed away in 2018 after a year - long battle with cancer . Western Illinois Peach Blossoms \u201c ' Peach Blossoms ' is the informal name of WIU 's Veterans Club with the purpose to help student - veterans adjust to college life after their time in service . They are also a group of the most passionate Leatherneck fans out there . The Peach Blossoms , a moniker adopted in the 1960s , can be seen during home games , tailgating , and the annual parade wearing their red-dyed mop tops and purple T-shirts . Villanova Tap the Rock The \u201c Tap the Rock \u201d mantra dates back to the 2009 national championship Villanova team . Team Chaplin , Father Rob Hagen , shared the Stonecutter Parable which describes a person wanting to break down a stone using only small chipping tools . The cutter goes on for a long time tapping the stone , eventually getting the stone to crack and fall apart . The message from the story is not reaching the goal . It 's realizing that , while the final tap of the rock was the one that broke it , it was all the taps leading up to it that played a key role . The message stuck and was engraved on the national title rings . Now , the football team still uses the saying and taps a rock as a reminder that the final play did n't win the game , but it was everything that added up to that final play . South Dakota Dakota Days ( D- Days ) The first Dakota Day was held in 1914 . Also known as D-Days , it 's a prideful week where the alumni return and the current students get to know more about the past traditions of the university . The weeklong celebration culminates with a parade Saturday before the football game . Of course , the students also use it as an excuse to do what college students typically do on a Saturday night . That side of D-Days can be found here : South Dakota State Hobo Day Another Homecoming celebration for a South Dakota school . The first official Hobo Day at SDSU took place in 1912 . It originally began as a \u201c nightshirt parade \u201d in 1907 where students prepared torches after a bonfire and marched through Main Street dressed in nightshirts and bedsheets . The tradition turned into Hobo Day in 1912 , where students simply dressed as hobos . The Homecoming celebration has continued to evolve over time while still maintaining traditions such as competitive beard - growing that started in the ' 30s . The Bummobile has also been a part of the parade for more than 100 years . Activities occur throughout the week , but it 's game day when the festivities really crank it up a notch and of course , the students have their own fun with it before and after the big football game . Jackson State Sonic Boom of the South entering the stadium to \u201c Get Ready \u201d HBCU marching bands are legendary and must - see shows . Perhaps no band sets the stage better during their football game performances than Jackson State 's , who enters the stadium playing \u201c Get Ready , \u201d an old Motown favorite selected as the band 's theme song in 1974 . Princeton The Bonfire If the ceremonial bonfire takes place , that means it was a special season for the Princeton football team . The fire only happens if the Tigers beat Harvard and Yale in the same season , giving the school bragging rights out of the \u201c Big Three . \u201d This started in the 1950s and as the tradition goes , it is the responsibility of the dink - <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Cause\": [], \"Sound_maker\": [\"the Victory Bell\"], \"Place\": [\"outside of the legendary Rose Hill Gym.\"], \"Time\": [\"After football wins\", \"at the start of graduation ceremonies\"], \"Agent\": [\"every senior\"]}"}

There seems to be a resurgence in Nintendo 's focus on WiiWare - There were three new WiiWare games last week and there 's three more this week . They 're probably not the titles most people were waiting for , though ... It should also be noted that every single game this week is new to western shores , so we do n't have any reviews yet - Think before you buy ! Drill Sergeant Mindstrong comes off as a fun party game with an army recruit theme , but judging by the Japanese release it seems to be nothing more than solving mathematical equations faster than your friends . The 800 Wii Points price does n't really seem to work in its favour either . We 'd like to be proven wrong though - Watch out for our review this week . In NEVES Plus , you are presented with a big picture - You are then given smaller blocks , which you must try to turn and fit together to recreate that picture . It 's a sequel to a DS game released in 2007 , and with ( supposedly ) over 500 different puzzles across multiple different game modes , for just 600 Wii Points , we think this could be a very good purchase if you like puzzle games . We 'll have a review soon , of course . We all knew it had to come sometime - Family Mini Golf is the fourth game in Aksys Games 's \" Family \" series , which was preceded by Table Tennis , Glide Hockey and Pirate Party . As the title implies , this time you 'll be playing mini golf . Of course , we always hope that new WiiWare games are good , but the series 's track record does n't exactly work in Mini Golf 's favour ! As such we recommend staying away from it until we 've reviewed it . The game costs 500 Wii Points , just like the previous three . Europe has three Art Style games on DSiWare which North America has yet to get - But for some reason Nintendo of America has decided to release the one game Europe does n't have yet first . Art Style : BOXLIFE is the western equivalent of Japan 's HACOLIFE . In this installment of the Art Style series , you are presented with what is basically a bunch of squares on the floor - Your job is to cut them up and then fold them into nice cubes . There 's both an increasingly difficult R&D mode and an endless Factory mode , and there 's a number of things to unlock to keep you busy as well . As with all DSiWare Art Style games it 's just 500 DSi Points - We 'll have a review up ASAP . The Virtual Console 's single new game this week was already announced in advance by Hudson Soft . SimEarth : The Living Planet is another game in Maxis 's line of \" Sim \" games , which also includes SimCity , SimTower , and of course , The Sims . It 's generally considered to be the hardest to play in the series , by far - This time you 're managing an entire planet instead of a city or even a single house , so as you might expect , there 's a ton of available options . Just take a look at Hudson Soft 's online manual for the game to get a good idea of how much stuff there is to do ! For the strategic masterminds , this game is pretty much a heaven - But people who like their games simple might want to stay away . Look out for the review soon ! No mascot fighting or LostWinds - esque puzzle solving just yet ! Will you be downloading any of this week 's new games ?

The key to success is making small adjustments and watching how the life forms react . SimEarth also includes planets with environments different from Earth , such as Mars and Venus . Try your hand at terraforming these planets with harsh conditions and creating a world where life can thrive .

He played a crucial role in exploring the creative possibilities of new console technology by working on some of the most innovative titles of the 1990s . After contributing to early installments of Wizardry and Phantasy Star , Ohshima created the iconic character designs for Sonic the Hedgehog . The blue mascot 's success paved the way for Ohshima 's directing turn on Sonic CD , a game brimming over with fresh ideas that few had an opportunity to experience due to the Sega CD 's unpopularity . His next major project , Nights Into Dreams for the Sega Saturn , was an audacious and beautiful attempt to claim the high ground during the early days of 3D console gaming . He followed Nights with Burning Rangers , another game for the ill-fated Saturn that was radically different from its violence - oriented 3D contemporaries . As the 90s came to an end he weathered the shifting fortunes of Sega by forming Artoon , developers of Blinx : The Time Sweeper , Blue Dragon , and Yoshi 's Island DS , and now heads the sometimes brilliant , occasionally aggravating , always interesting Cavia -- recently responsible for Capcom 's Resident Evil : Darkside Chronicles , and currently working on Square Enix 's upcoming Nier . You recently became the CEO of Cavia , moving over from Artoon -- or is it more complex than that ? Naoto Ohshima : Well , the head of the company here quit because of ... family issues . ( laughs ) Since they then lacked a president , I sort of wound up taking over that role , since we 're all technically part of the same outfit . ( Ed. note : Artoon , Cavia , and Feelplus are all under AQ Interactive . ) I do like a lot of Cavia 's games . Though they often seem unpolished -- the games seem to get \" almost there , \" do you know what I mean ? Bullet Witch and Ghost In The Shell : Stand Alone Complex both have something to them , but these certainly do n't feel like Ohshima -style games . NO : Well , certainly , I do a lot of management - type work these days . I definitely want to make something again ! I really do . Your first major console game with Artoon was Blinx . You might say it was ahead of its time ... games like Prince of Persia used a time mechanic long afterward and saw great success with it . Where did that idea come from ? NO : It was purely a product of the hard drive included with every Xbox -- the original one , not the 360 . We wanted to build a console game from the ground up that used the drive effectively . That 's where the play mechanic came from ? NO : That 's right . There would n't be any other way to do it . The PS2 would n't have been able to do it . Do you think it would be possible to make another mascot-style platforming game in the current era ? NO : Ah , well , I 'm making a game like that right now . ( laughs ) I ca n't quite talk about that yet , though . In more general terms , the game needs to be something that anyone is able to play , and it needs to have one thing or element that is brand new , that has n't been done before . Nights Into Dreams Nights Into Dreams on the Saturn was the first really 3D game I played , long ago . As the Nights character you had a certain path you followed in 2D , but if you went back to human form , you could walk around anywhere you liked . I found a lot of things that way that I could n't see as Nights , and it was a sort of turning point for me ; it felt like a real - life world to me , making these discoveries . You do n't get that pure feeling of discovery much in games anymore . Was that something you were purposefully aiming for with Nights ? NO : Well , with people my age , we did n't really have video games as children . When we came up with concepts for games , we could n't say \" It 's some of this game and some of that other game . \" As a result , especially around that era , you had a lot of games that did not become truly evaluated by the public until long after their release . There just were n't a lot of 3D games back then . Of course , with Nights , if you keep going and going along the ground you eventually run into an invisible wall , so ... we had to think about ways to keep players from going that far off ; that 's where the Alarm Egg came from ( Ed. note : a wandering alarm clock that follows the human player and wakes them from the dreamland , thereby ending the level ) . BS : What made you want to put features like that into the non- Nights section of the game ? NO : Well , the original inspiration for the game was to create a Peter Pan-like character . Nights and Peter Pan share that character trait ; they 're both capable of things that regular people can only do in their dreams . So I wanted two games here , in a way ; one where you were human , and one where you combined with Nights to accomplish extraordinary things . Nobody had really played a full - on , free -running 3D game at that time , so we were concerned that people would have trouble comprehending the game if it gave you complete control freedom . As a result , as a human , you have freedom , but only in a small , confined space . Combine with Nights , and the game switches to a side - scrolling type , as gamers would 've been readily familiar with at that time . In a way , having a vulnerable human character able to do things Nights could n't is somewhat empowering to the player . NO : I agree . Christmas Nights was also ahead of its time -- the idea that you could unlock extra stuff depending on what the date is . Those sorts of games are still rare to see . NO : Indeed . That game is mostly the same as Nights , but it was very literally a Christmas present for our audience , a sort of thank - you from Sega to its fans . That was the concept . I was an enormous fan of Sega , around the Saturn and Mega Drive \/ Genesis eras , and that certainly calls to mind the Sega of old . What struck me about Christmas Nights was that there was a lot of stuff in there , altered graphics and such , that would only be playable for two days ' time . NO : We had the idea to have Spring Nights , Summer Nights , and so forth , reflecting all of the seasons . It really was n't a technological challenge , as the textures do n't really change much . It did n't take a lot of time , and I think its mission of drumming up interest and excitement among our fans was pretty well met . What did you think of the new Nights ? NO : The Wii one ? That project was led by [ Takashi ] Iizuka , who was the lead designer on the original Nights . He really loves that character , and I 'm sure that he was able to create the Nights that he wanted to create . It did n't feel the same to me . NO : It was , perhaps , more Americanized than before . The original Nights was chiefly made with the Japanese and European audiences in mind -- Sonic , meanwhile , was squarely aimed at the U.S. market . In what way did you position Sonic for the U.S. market ? NO : Well , he 's a character that I think is suited to America -- or , at least , the image I had of America at the time . Nights is a more delicate ... well , his gender is deliberately ambiguous , for one . It 's a cliched question , but was that why Sonic 's main colors are red , white and blue ? NO : ( laughs ) Well , he 's blue because that 's Sega 's more - or - less official company color . His shoes were inspired by the cover to Michael Jackson 's Bad , which contrasted heavily between white and red -- that Santa Claus - type color . I also thought that red went well for a character who can run really fast , when his legs are spinning . Sonic CD You were also the director of Sonic CD -- another game that had time travel as a play mechanic . Have you liked that mechanic for a while ? NO : Well , I wanted a Sonic where the levels changed on you -- where Sonic would go really fast , like in Back to the Future , and bang , wind up in a different place . Why do you think you 've been involved with a lot of games with time elements to them ? NO : I had n't realized that , actually . ( laughs ) There must be a part of me that likes that sort of thing , the time . Sonic CD really felt great in action . It does n't have the full - on speed of Sonic 2 , but the world feels really alive in the game , much in the same that it did for me in Nights -- that feeling that the game world would still be alive even if I were n't exploring it . Was that your intention ? NO : Sonic CD was made in Japan , while Sonic 2 was made by ( Yuji ) Naka 's team over in the U.S. We exchanged information , of course , talking about the sort of game design each of us was aiming for . But Sonic CD was n't Sonic 2 ; it was really meant to be more of a CD version of the original Sonic . I ca n't help but wonder , therefore , if we had more fun making CD than they did making Sonic 2 [ because we did n't have the pressure of making a \" numbered sequel \" ] . What I really wanted to do was just have this sonic boom , with a flash , and have the level change on you instantly . We just could n't manage it on the hardware , though , so instead there 's that sequence that plays while it 's loading . ( laughs ) I kept fighting and fighting with the programmers , but they said it just was n't possible . I bet they probably could have done it . NO : I know ! ( laughs ) If Naka was doing the programming , I think it could 've been done . Do you know why Naka left Sega ? NO : No , actually . The way he put it , he was too far up -- he was doing nothing but management and could n't do any design or programming work on games . He could n't even influence Sonic anymore . I thought that was admirable that he went on to try to do creative work again . NO : Indeed . In fact , it was really the same deal with me and Artoon . Now , though , the group as a whole has gotten really big -- it 's sort of a mini-Sega . So will you be making your type of game in the future , then , or are you going to be making more darker - styled games , as Artoon and Cavia have been moving toward ? NO : Well , the important thing is to make gamers happy -- the users playing your game . When you make something that 's truly new -- well , it 's not that you have to with every project , but when you do , you 're expanding the world of games . That 's what I want to do ; I want to keep on doing new things , and I think that 's possible with Artoon , Cavia , and Feelplus . The way I see it , if the director makes the sort of games he wants to make , then the end results are going to be more interesting . The gamers are important , of course , but if you make a game for yourself , that adds character to the result . NO : Well , for example none of my favorite movies were really hits .

Hot topics include strategies for targeting GPCRs therapeutically , and understanding the mechanisms of biased agonism . A number of distinguished speakers will present their latest GPCR research at the GPCR Colloquium at the \u201c American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics \u201d meeting . In the phenomenon of biased agonism in GPCRs , a biased ligand activates one signaling pathway without activating another . \u201c Biased agonism represented a paradigm shift , \u201d says Robert Lefkowitz , M.D. , professor of chemistry at Duke University and winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with his colleague and former post-doc Brian Kobilka of Stanford University for their seminal work on 7 - transmembrane domain GPCRs . \u201c Much to our total surprise , we realized that an agonist could stimulate one pathway \u2014 G proteins or the arrestins \u2014 without stimulating the other . It was a realization that this system could not only turn off G protein signaling , but also establish signaling pathways on its own . \u201d In addition to the development of GPCR research and biased agonism , Dr. Lefkowitz also plans to unveil some new results of a collaboration with Kobilka 's lab , in which they are trying to work out the molecular mechanisms of biased agonists . \u201c We 're using a variety of structural approaches , including x-ray crystallography , to get at the mechanisms of biased agonists . \u201d Indeed , the importance of biased agonism in GPCR drug discovery is the work of one of Dr. Lefkowitz ' former post-docs , Jonathan Violin , Ph.D. , now head of biology at Trevena . He will discuss how Trevena is using receptor bias for clinical development of pain therapeutics . They are focused on using biased ligands to separate \u201c on-target adverse effects , \u201d or adverse effects presumed inseparable from a drug 's pharmacology , from the drug 's intended therapeutic effects . For example , Trevena recently discovered an analgesic drug targeting the mu-opioid receptor whose signaling mechanism partly resembles that of morphine , yet differs in that it does not engage beta-arrestins \u2014 and therapeutically shows reduced adverse effects of respiratory suppression and opioid-induced constipation . \u201c We are engaging the very well precedented and very valuable analgesia of this target , but hopefully in a safer and more tolerable fashion , by more precisely tuning in the kinds of intracellular signals that we desire , \u201d says Dr. Violin . He notes the value of beginning with known targets and signaling mechanisms , and then working to understand the mechanisms of biased ligands of these targets . \u201c What we think is happening with biased ligands is that we are stabilizing a subset of conformations associated with the active pharmacological entity or entities , \u201d he says . In other words , a biased ligand activates only a subset of the different signaling pathways and in vivo pharmacological responses that they normally observe with the full agonist . \u201c To us , that 's part of the value in our approach , \u201d he says , \u201c that we can take targets for which we know a lot about their clinical benefits or clinical risks , and dissect those so that we do n't have to lay out completely new biological pathways . \u201d \u201c We 're interested in studying new , functionally selective molecules that will activate G protein pathways selectively , or activate the beta-arrestin pathways selectively , \u201d says Jeff Aub\u00e9 , Ph.D. , professor and chemist at the University of Kansas . His work is motivated by the need to grow the toolbox of biased ligands . \u201c We 've sought to expand the scope of available compounds for study in this field by using different approaches , including screening and de novo design , \u201d he says . \u201c We have identified preliminary examples of five new , entirely different chemical classes with a range of potencies , and qualitatively different pharmacologies . \u201d Dr. Aub\u00e9 hopes that expanding the toolkit of biased ligands will help other researchers in the field . \u201c There are a lot of people who are interested in indications like addiction , who would be interested in , say , a potent partial agonist , \u201d he says . \u201c But that 's not really available right now . \u201d GPCRs in Therapeutics \u201c It is increasingly obvious that taking advantage of ligand - biased signaling will provide for some GPCR targets a way to modulate therapeutically relevant pathways while potentially avoiding unwanted physiology , \u201d says Christian Felder , Ph.D. , a research fellow in psychiatric disorders at Eli Lilly . \u201c Allosteric regulation of GPCRs has taken the science to a new level of possibilities , although with inherently increased complexity in execution . \u201d He stresses the need for more effective pharmacological tools , which will entail further work on GPCR crystal structures , in silico molecular dynamic simulations , and translational bioassay development . \u201c Without good ligand tools , research challenges such as deorphanizing of new GPCR targets and deconvoluting disease etiology become even bigger . \u201d Dr. Felder also believes that GPCR drug discovery will continue to benefit from partnerships among academia , government , and industry . \u201c A deeper understanding of structure , function , and physiology can only happen when we bring together the various disciplines of chemical , physical , and biological sciences to embrace the obvious complexity of how GPCRs regulate complex pathways and circuits , \u201d says Dr. Felder . \u201c Recent advances in active - state GPCR crystallography and in silico molecular dynamics are informing ligand - receptor interactions in much more detail , \u201d resulting in more efficient drug design . Int vitro models , such as inducible pluripotent stem cells , can give relevant information in a disease context , which can in turn \u201c inform translational animal models that may more directly mimic human disease etiology , \u201d says Dr. Felder . Heptares Therapeutics takes another angle on therapeutics , developing drugs to GPCR targets to which previous attempts have been unsuccessful , yet for which there is strong evidence for disease involvement . \u201c There remain a large number of GPCRs with a high level of clinical validation in disease that have not been drugged by small molecules , \u201d says the firm 's CSO , Fiona Marshall , Ph.D. \u201c For example , GLP1 is an important target in diabetes . However , only injectable peptides have been discovered for this receptor so far . \u201d Heptares uses a structure - based drug design platform called StaR , which engineers GPCRs to increase their thermostability \u2014 the result being that they can be purified from cell membranes . This lets them take advantage of drug discovery methods commonly used for soluble proteins , but normally impossible with membrane proteins , such as x-ray crystallography . \u201c Sta Rs are locked in specific chosen conformational states , such as agonist or antagonist , \u201d says Dr. Marshall , \u201c and can be used to define the pharmacology of compounds by measuring the relative binding to different conformations \u2014 a process known as ' reverse pharmacology ' . \u201d Heptares uses x-ray structures to look at receptor binding sites and protein-ligand interactions . They utilize the atomic resolution of x-ray structures to find small but significant differences between ligand binding sites of GPCRs in activated and inactive states , and then use the protein structure for the form of their chosen target for drug discovery . In her presentation , Dr. Marshall will discuss Heptares ' identification of drug candidates , including \u201c the identification of highly selective muscarinic agonists for the treatment of Alzheimer 's disease , and the identification of orexin antagonists for sleep disorders and addiction , \u201d she says . \u201c I will also be giving a first look at the first Family B GPCR structure that has been solved . \u201d GPCR Trafficking Looking at therapeutic opportunities of GPCRs from another angle is the lab of Mark von Zastrow , M.D. , Ph.D. , professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at UCSF . Traditionally , GPCR trafficking can determine in part whether a signaling response is sustained or downregulated , and it occurs over a longer period of hours or more . But Dr. von Zastrow is looking at GPCR trafficking events that occur seconds to minutes after ligand application \u2014 an acute trafficking response that occurs much faster than previously thought . \u201c Such effects are much less well understood , \u201d he says . \u201c GPCR trafficking mechanisms offer , in principle , a wide range of new biochemical targets for therapeutic manipulation . To my knowledge , the in vivo potential of such targets remains a little - explored area . \u201d Dr. von Zastrow will discuss results on mechanisms of GPCR localization , trafficking , and signaling from both biochemical and optimal imaging techniques , and will focus on recent progress toward developing new therapeutics . \u201c We are particularly interested in processes that affect neural and cardiovascular function , \u201d he says . \u201c An over - arching challenge is to link mechanistic understanding , elucidated largely in vitro or using reduced cell culture preparations , to in vivo effects as they occur in relevant tissues . \u201d The field is accumulating evidence for independent mechanisms of GPCR trafficking and GPCR signaling , according to Dr. von Zastrow . \u201c The idea that drugs can selectively influence one of these was considered highly controversial even five years ago , \u201d he says . \u201c However , little is known about the consequences of such selective ligand effects in vivo , or their potential therapeutic significance . In my opinion , this represents another exciting frontier with great therapeutic potential . \u201d <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Place\": [], \"Portal\": [\"one signaling pathway\"], \"Agent\": [\"Trevena\"], \"Useful_location\": [\"to separate \\u201c on-target adverse effects , \\u201d or adverse effects presumed inseparable from a drug 's pharmacology , from the drug 's intended therapeutic effects\"]}"}

The former AFL superstar is not happy with the AFL 's decision to cut the lengths of quarters from 20 minutes to 16 minutes this season and has laid the blame squarely on members of the media who are \u201c tired of the game \u201d . \u201c A lot of media people who push that the game should be shorter , I think they watch a lot of footy and sometimes can be tired by the game , \u201d Lloyd told 3 AW Radio .

AFL happy with fixture plan The AFL will stick with games from Thursday to Sunday amid talk the competition should stop scheduling matches at the same time . TV viewers have traditionally had to switch between games on Saturday and Sunday with many overlapping . But for the first four rounds of the competition restart , three matches will be played consecutively on Sundays with the AFL pushing back the twilight fixture to a 6.05 pm timeslot . With Thursday nights locked in for the first month , it means the only games being played simultaneously will be on a Saturday night . It has led to some football identities , including former Brisbane champion Jonathan Brown and Brownlow medallist Gerard Healy , calling for the AFL to scrap overlapping matches altogether . Since 2017 , the NRL has avoided fixture clashes with a regular Thursday night game , followed by back - to - back matches on Friday nights . It previously tried Monday night football for a decade . But the AFL 's fixture boss says Travis Auld says they wo n't be going down that path anytime soon . Sunday nights are not even certain to stay when crowds are allowed back , with the timeslot previously proving unpopular with families . \u201c We feel we 've been able to accommodate with the Thursday nights enough of those big games and then spread out the rest of the round , \u201d Auld told Fox Footy . \u201c ( Two Friday night games ) could 've happened this year given we 're not concerned with crowds but we feel like Thursday nights will work quite well . \u201c We had those discussions particularly with our broadcast partners to see what their preference would be and it landed on Thursday through to Sundays . \u201c It also works well for the clubs because it helps you manage days breaks and obviously that 's pretty important when you 're flying around the country . \u201d With AAP Stream Free on <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Cause\": [], \"Agent\": [\"the AFL 's\"], \"Event\": [\"its quarters\"], \"Time\": [\"the 2020 season\"]}"}

Pure Food and Wine has been the go -to spot for the city 's wellness elite , like superstar yogis , for more than a decade . Celebrities like Katie Holmes eat there , and Alec Baldwin found Hilaria by dining in the picturesque garden . So naturally , many were shocked by the turn of events . Employees from both Pure Food and Wine and takeout sister shop One Lucky Duck began protesting outside the restaurant with signs that said \" Wages Now ! \" and \" Many Unlucky Ducks , \" and Grubstreet published an essay from a waitress detailing how long it had been since her and her co-workers had been paid . Through it all , Melngailis stayed silent , not responding to requests from reporters and going mum on social media . Now , nearly a month later , the restaurant and One Lucky Duck locations remain shuttered ( and the New York Times even declared them \" closed \" last week ) . But Melngailis has surfaced , first via a personal blog post , and then agreeing to an exclusive interview with Well + Good . When asked , she declined to share the exact details of the events leading up to the payroll debacle , but admitted that a variety of circumstances ( both personal and professional ) caused the situation to spin out of control . \" When things are on the edge , its easier for things to come apart , \" she said . \" What a lot of people and even the staff do n't know is that the restaurant has a very complicated history , and from day one has had an enormous amount of debt on the books . People from the outside see a busy restaurant , and they assume I must live in a huge penthouse ... and it could not be more opposite . There are plenty of times I have not been paying my own rent to make payroll . \" Running a restaurant focused on high - quality , healthy ingredients in the most expensive city in the country , she says , has also been nearly unsustainable . \" The ingredients are all organic and perishable and very expensive . It 's really , really hard to make it work . A lot of healthy , organic businesses have started and gone out of business . The margins are so slim , \" she says . Of course , none of the explanations for the financial woes change the fact that staffers have not been paid for many hours already worked , and one of their biggest complaints was that Melngailis had been absent and silent rather than filling them in on what was going on . On this point , Melngailis says she 's particularly distraught , explaining that she was out of town looking into solutions to some of the restaurant 's problems when the walk - out happened , and she wishes she had been more communicative . \" I have a tendency , when I 'm feeling bad and down , to really hide and work on my computer and try to fix things , \" she says . \" It 's painful for me every day knowing that they 're all waiting on me . That hurts me every day . I get that people do n't understand \u2014 I do n't expect them to \u2014 and at some point I can explain it more , once the dust settles , and more importantly , once they 're paid . It 's heartbreaking to me . \" As for the future , Melngailis says she 's working day and night to secure funding to get the business back up and running as soon as possible , but she 's not ready to commit to any timeline . \" I would n't say anything until everything is confirmed , \" she says . \" I look forward to healing all those relationships and making things right . \" \u2014 Lisa Elaine Held <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [\"2015\"], \"Agent\": [\"Sarma Melngailis\"], \"Place\": [\"Pure Food and Wine and takeout sister shop One Lucky Duck\"], \"Event\": [\"Wages\"], \"Cause\": [\"an enormous amount of debt\", \"The ingredients are all organic and perishable and very expensive\", \"The margins are so slim\"]}"}

Continuing Education Activity Uterine atony is a principal cause of postpartum hemorrhage , an obstetric emergency . Globally , it is one of the top 5 causes of maternal mortality . Uterine atony refers to the inadequate contraction of the corpus uteri myometrial cells in response to endogenous oxytocin release . Postpartum hemorrhage can occur because spiral arteries are uniquely devoid of musculature and dependent on uterine contractions to mechanically squeeze them into hemostasis . After delivery , in the absence of uterine contraction , spiral arteries may continue to bleed , resulting in postpartum hemorrhage . This activity reviews the evaluation and management of uterine atony and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well - coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients . Objectives : - Explain how to detect uterine atony . - Explain the risks associated with uterine atony . - Describe how to manage uterine atony . - Explain the importance of improving care coordination , with particular emphasis on communication between interprofessional medical teams , to enhance to prevent hemorrhage in patients with uterine atony . Introduction Uterine atony refers to the corpus uteri myometrial cells inadequate contraction in response to endogenous oxytocin that is released in the course of delivery . It leads to postpartum hemorrhage as delivery of the placenta leaves disrupted spiral arteries which are uniquely void of musculature and dependent on contractions to mechanically squeeze them into a hemostatic state . Uterine atony is a principal cause of postpartum hemorrhage , an obstetric emergency . Globally , this is one of the top 5 causes of maternal mortality . [ 1 ] Etiology Risk factors for uterine atony include prolonged labor , precipitous labor , uterine distension ( multi-fetal gestation , polyhydramnios , fetal macrosomia ) , fibroid uterus , chorioamnionitis , indicated magnesium sulfate infusions , and prolonged use of oxytocin . Ineffective uterine contraction , either focally or diffusely , is additionally associated with a diverse range of etiologies including retained placental tissue , placental disorders ( such as morbidly adherent placenta , placenta previa , and abruption placentae ) , coagulopathy ( increased fibrin degradation products ) and uterine inversion . Body mass index ( BMI ) above 40 ( class III obesity ) is also a recognized risk factor for postpartum uterine atony . [ 2 ] Epidemiology The absence of effective contraction of the uterus after delivery complicates 1 in 40 births in the United States and is responsible for at least 75 % of cases of postpartum hemorrhage . [ 3 ] Pathophysiology Contraction of the myometrium that mechanically compresses the blood vessels supplying the placental bed provides the principal mechanism uterine hemostasis after delivery of the fetus , and the placenta is concluded . The process is complemented by local decidual hemostatic factors such as tissue factor type -1 plasminogen activator inhibitor as well as by systemic coagulation factors such as platelets , circulating clotting factors . History and Physical At prenatal history and examination , risk factor discernment is key to optimal risk management . Identification of risks allows for planning and availability of resources that might be needed including personnel , medication , equipment , adequate intravenous access , and blood products . The American College of Obstetricians recommends that women be identified prenatally as high risk for postpartum hemorrhage based on the presence of placenta accreta spectrum , pre-pregnancy BMI greater than 50 , clinically significant bleeding disorder , or other surgical - medical high - risk factors . Part of the planning should be to develop a plan that allows delivery at a facility with an appropriate level of care for these patients ' needs . The diagnosis is made during the physical exam immediately upon conclusion of an obstetric vaginal or cesarean delivery . Direct palpation at cesarean delivery ( typically after the closure of the uterine incision ) or indirect examination at bimanual examination after a vaginal delivery reveals a boggy , soft , and an unusually enlarged uterus , typically with co-existent bleeding from the cervical os ( harder to appreciate at cesarean deliveries ) . An expeditious exclusion of retained gestational products or obstetric lacerations quickly excludes additional co-concomitant etiologies . The possibility of coagulopathies is considered and pursued if clinically indicated . The physical examination suggested above may involve obstetric ultrasound imaging . Evaluation Diagnosis of diffuse uterine atony is prompted typically by finding of more than usual blood loss during examination demonstrating a flaccid and enlarged uterus , which may contain a significant amount of blood . With focal localized atony , the fundal region may be well contracted while the lower uterine segment is dilated and atonic , which may difficult to appreciate on abdominal examination , but may be detected on vaginal examination . A digital exploration of the uterine cavity ( if adequate anesthesia is available ) , or bedside obstetric ultrasound imaging to reveal an echogenic endometrial stripe is an essential examination , as is a timely examination with adequate lighting to exclude an obstetric laceration . Treatment \/ Management Prenatal Readiness If the woman is at a medium risk for intrapartum , blood should include be typed and screened . Women with a medium risk factor for uterine atony - related postpartum hemorrhage include prior uterine surgery , multiple gestation , grand multiparity , prior PPH , large fibroids , macrosomia , body mass index greater than 40 , anemia , chorioamnionitis , prolonged second stage , oxytocin longer than 24 hours , and magnesium sulfate administration . Those assessed to be high risk should be typed and cross - matched for those at high risk of PPH . High -risk criteria include placental previa or accreta , bleeding diathesis , 2 or more medium risk factors for uterine atony . Use of a cell saver ( blood salvage ) should be considered for women at increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage , but this is not cost-effective to be routine . Intrapartum Prevention This includes optimal management of the third stage of labor . Active management of the third stage includes uterine massage with concomitant sustained low-level traction on the umbilical cord . Simultaneous oxytocin infusion is helpful , although it is reasonable to defer it to after delivery of the placenta . Initial Medical Treatment If uterine atony occurs , healthcare providers should be ready for initial medical management which is directed to the use of medications to improve tone and induce uterine contractions . Massaging the uterus is also effective , as is ensuring an empty cavity . Maternal support with intravenous ( IV ) fluids is commenced through preferably an u8 - gauge , intravenous catheter . A team approach is initiated with the summoning of the needed personnel through a standardized built - in alert system . Medications used for postpartum hemorrhage secondary to Uterine atony include the following : - Oxytocin ( Pitocin ) can be given IV 10 to 40 units per 1000 ml or 10 units intramuscularly ( IM ) . The rapid undiluted infusion may cause hypotension . - Methylergonovine ( Methergine ) given IM 0.2 mg. Given every 2 to 4 hours . Should be avoided in patients with hypertension . - 15 - methyl-PGF2 -alpha ( Hemabate ) given IM 0.25 mg . Given every 15 to 90 minutes for a maximum of 8 doses . Should be avoided in asthmatics . May cause diarrhea , fevers , or tachycardia . It is expensive . - Misoprostol ( Cytotec ) : 800 to 1000 mg placed rectally . May cause a low-grade fever . It has a delayed action . - Dinoprostone ( Prostin E2 ) 20 mg vaginal or rectal suppository may be given every 2 hours . Surgical Treatment Should the medications fail with persisting excess bleeding , then surgical management is engaged . [ 4 ] Tamponade Techniques - Uterine packing with gauze ( with vaginal packing to ensure its retention , thus a uterovaginal packing ) with Foley catheter insertion to allow bladder drainage . The uterine packing should be tight and uniform , and it is a quickly and efficiently achieved with rolled gauze ribbons . - Bakri balloon ( with vaginal packing to ensure its retention ) with Foley catheter insertion to facilitate bladder drainage . Surgical Management Techniques - Uterine curettage for retained products - Uterine artery ligation ( O' Leary ) , with an option to for extending arterial ligation to tubo-ovarian vessels . - Compression sutures such as the B-Lynch are typically reserved for clinical scenarios where bimanual compression of the uterus leads to arrest in bleeding . - Hypogastric artery ligation ( performed by Gyn \/ Onc ) - Hysterectomy Differential Diagnosis The typical physical findings elude detection in the presence of uterine eversion when the endometrial surface everts into the vagina and allowed by uterine atony . This typically occurs after a vaginal delivery , and the usual findings of an enlarged boggy uterus are unavailable and replaced by findings of an intra-vaginal mass that is cherry colored ( endometrium ) and should be immediately replaced back into the uterine cavity , after which restoration of uterine tone prevents its recurrence . Prognosis Women with a prior PPH have as much as a 15 % risk of recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy . The risk of recurrence depends , in part , on the underlying cause and associations such as class 3 obesity may have a higher recurrence risk . Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care Postpartum anemia is common after an episode of uterine atony and postpartum hemorrhage . Severe anemia due to PPH may require red cell transfusions , depending on the severity of anemia and the degree of symptomatology attributable to anemia . A common practice is to offer a transfusion to symptomatic women with a hemoglobin value less than 7 g\/dL . In most cases of uterine atony - related postpartum hemorrhage , the amount of iron lost is not fully replaced by the transfused blood . Oral iron should thus be also considered . Parenteral iron therapy is an option as it accelerated recovery . Most women with mild to moderate anemia , however , resolve the anemia sufficiently rapidly with oral iron alone and do not need parenteral iron . Pearls and Other Issues In recognition that the majority of the cases of postpartum hemorrhage are due to uterine atony , implementation of a systemic approach in birthing units is advocated by all leading professional bodies . Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes The Joint Commission recommends that obstetrical staff undergo interprofessional team training to teach staff to work together and communicate more effectively when postpartum hemorrhage ( most due to uterine atony ) occurs . The Commission is in favor of clinical drills to help staff prepare for the clinical event , as well as conducting debriefings after such events to evaluate team performance and identify areas for improvement . Simulation team training can help to identify areas that need strengthening , and regular , unannounced , simulated , postpartum hemorrhage scenarios in real - life settings , such as the labor and delivery units or post-anesthesia care units , may also increase comfort with the protocols and teamwork required in such emergencies . Such a systemic approach creates a positive trajectory toward improved obstetric outcomes and is also endorsed by <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Place\": [\"uterus\"], \"Patient\": [\"blood\"], \"Time\": [\"after delivery of the fetus\"]}"}

Denzil Holles , 1st Baron Holles , BCW Project , accessed 10 - 05 - 18 Cromwell was sometimes mockingly referred to as \" England 's Hercules \" by his enemies : under this interpretation , the club has been suggested to hint at Cromwell 's military rule , and the phallus to mock his Puritanism . Lashmar , \" No prehistoric giant step for man , but a huge insult to Cromwell \" , The Independent , 16-05-2000 In 1967 Kenneth Carrdus proposed that the Holles referred to in Hutchins ' account was Denzil Holles ' son Francis , MP for Dorchester in 1679 - 80 : he claimed that the figures and letters noted by Hutchins could be made to read \" fh 1680 \" , though was unable to find much other evidence to support this . Castleden ( 1996 ) p.49 <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> The outspoken leader of the Presbyterian \" Peace Party \" in the House of Commons during the Civil Wars , he became a baron and privy councillor after the Restoration Denzil Holles was the second surviving son of John Holles ( d.1637 ) and Anne , daughter of Sir Thomas Stanhope . John Holles owned substantial lands in Nottinghamshire and property in London . He purchased the barony of Haughton and the earldom of Clare in an unsuccessful attempt to ingratiate himself at the court of King James I. Both titles were inherited by Denzil 's older brother , John . Denzil Holles attended Christ 's College , Cambridge , and Gray 's Inn , then made an advantageous marriage to heiress Dorothy Ashley in 1626 . After Dorothy 's death in 1641 , Holles married Jane , the wealthy widow of Sir Walter Covert . His third marriage , in 1666 , was also to a wealthy widow , Esther Richer , widow of Jacques Richer , a French nobleman . Holles 's political career began in 1624 when he was elected MP for St Michael in Cornwall . He came to prominence as MP for Dorchester in the second session of King Charles I 's third Parliament . During the violent scenes that accompanied the dissolution of Parliament in March 1629 , Holles physically held the Speaker , Sir John Finch , in his chair and read out Parliament 's declaration of grievances against the King . Holles was arrested with Sir John Eliot and seven others for his part in the protest . He was briefly imprisoned in the Tower , then brought before the court of the King 's Bench in February 1630 on a charge of conspiracy . Although he refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the King 's Bench over offences committed in Parliament , Holles was fined one thousand marks . He eventually paid the fine , but was later compensated by the Long Parliament , which ruled that his prosecution was a breach of parliamentary privilege . During the early sessions of the Long Parliament , Holles consistently maintained the view that Charles I was a good king , misled by evil counsellors . However , he did not join the attack on the King 's most unpopular adviser Lord Strafford , who was married to his sister . Holles attempted to mediate for Strafford 's life in Parliament and spoke on behalf of his family . In all other matters , Holles was firmly in opposition to the King . He presented the impeachment of Archbishop Laud in the House of Lords , supported the Root and Branch Bill against Episcopacy , drafted the Grand Remonstrance with John Pym and aggressively supported Hesilrige 's Militia Bill . After refusing an attempt to buy him off with the offer of a position at court , Holles was named as one of the Five Members whom the King attempted to arrest in January 1642 . When the First Civil War broke out in 1642 , Holles raised a regiment of foot for Parliament and went with the Earl of Bedford to the unsuccessful siege of Sherborne Castle . He was present at the battle of Edgehill in October 1642 , where he courageously held his position and tried to rally the troops scattered by Prince Rupert 's charge . The following month , however , his regiment was wiped out when Rupert stormed Brentford during the King 's advance on London , One-third of Holles 's regiment were killed and most of the rest were taken prisoner . Although he was not present at Brentford , Holles 's confidence was badly shaken . He withdrew from the military and turned down the offer of a senior command in the Parliamentarian army . During the winter of 1642 - 3 , he emerged as a leading member of the \" Peace Party \" in Parliament , taking an active part in the negotiations that took place between Parliament and the King at Oxford in the spring of 1643 , at Uxbridge during the winter of 1644 - 5 and at Newcastle in the summer of 1646 . Holles 's support for a negotiated settlement between King and Parliament brought him to prominence as a leader of the Presbyterian faction against the Independents . He clashed violently with Oliver Cromwell , whom he hated , accusing him of cowardice and saying that all his successes were due to chance and good fortune . In association with Scottish representatives and the Earl of Essex , Holles attempted to impeach Cromwell in December 1644 as an \" incendiary between the two nations \" . With the ending of the First Civil War in 1646 , Holles took a leading role in the bitter dispute between the Presbyterian MPs and the New Model Army . Following the dissolution of the Committee for Both Kingdoms in January 1647 , Holles and his Presbyterian allies took over effective control of the government . They planned to pay the Scottish army to return home , after which the English army was to be disbanded and negotiations opened for a settlement with the King . Although the Scots were paid off , the New Model Army refused to disband before arrears of pay were settled and other grievances addressed . In March 1647 , Holles denounced the soldiers who petitioned Parliament as \" enemies of the state \" . This resulted in the politicisation of the Army during the spring and summer of 1647 and its alliance with the radical Leveller movement . In June 1647 , Holles was foremost among the Eleven Members whose suspension from Parliament and impeachment was demanded by Army leaders . In response , Holles called for the mobilisation of the London militia against the New Model Army , but when General Fairfax led the Army into London in August 1647 , Presbyterian opposition quickly melted away . Most of the Eleven Members fled to the Continent . Holles went to Normandy , where he remained for almost a year . In June 1648 , during the Second Civil War , Parliament voted to repeal the impeachment against the Eleven Members . Holles returned to London in August and immediately resumed his attempts to reach a negotiated treaty with King Charles . He was one of the parliamentary commissioners at the Treaty of Newport , where he threw himself at the King 's feet , imploring him to accept Parliament 's terms . Holles presented the report from the commissioners at Newport to the House of Commons on 1 December and recommended that negotiations should be continued , to which Parliament agreed . This infuriated Army leaders and the Independent faction in Parliament and was the catalyst for Pride 's Purge on 6 December 1648 . The Army demanded the arrest of Holles and the other impeached MPs who had retaken their seats , but once again he escaped to France . After the execution of Charles I in January 1649 , Holles wrote to Charles II urging him to form an alliance with the Scots to regain the throne but he refused an offer to become Charles ' secretary of state in 1651 . Cromwell attempted a reconciliation with Holles and other exiled Presbyterians in 1654 and he returned to England where he lived quietly until the eve of the Restoration . Holles was among the secluded MPs who were re-admitted to Parliament when General Monck reversed Pride 's Purge in February 1660 and he was one the commissioners appointed to go to the Hague to deliver Parliament 's invitation to Charles II to return to England . Holles preceded Charles to England to prepare for his reception and was appointed to the privy council on 5 June 1660 . He emerged as the most vindictive of the thirty - four commissioners appointed to try the regicides in September and October . On 20 April 1661 , he was created first Baron Holles of Ifield in Sussex . Holles was English ambassador to Paris from 1662 - 7 , but his obsession with protocol was severely criticised . He was one of the commissioners who negotiated the treaty that ended the Second Anglo - Dutch War in June 1667 . In December 1667 , Holles was one of four peers who protested at the banishment of the Earl of Clarendon , which almost cost him his place on the privy council . However , he remained active in Restoration politics until his death in 1680 . He was buried at Westminster Abbey and a monument to him was erected in St Peter 's in Dorchester . His only son Francis ( 1627 - 90 ) succeeded as the second Baron Holles . The peerage became extinct after the death of his grandson Denzil , third Baron Holles , in 1694 . C.H.

Arctic Thaw : Merkel Inspects a Changing Climate in Greenland Spiegel Online , 17 August 2007 . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Arctic Thaw Merkel Inspects a Changing Climate in Greenland As a former physicist and environment minister , it is only natural that German Chancellor Angela Merkel would want to learn about the consequences of global warming first hand . Merkel and Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel began a two -day visit to Greenland Thursday to see the Ilulissat Icefjord , a UNESCO world heritage site , and the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier . The glacier , which is located about 200 kilometers ( 125 miles ) north of the Arctic Circle , has thinned in recent years in what scientists say is one of the most obvious signs of global warming . Experts are concerned that Greenland 's melting ice sheet could cause global sea levels to rise , with catastrophic effects on low-lying areas . Merkel said that China and the United States must be part of a new deal replacing the Kyoto Protocol limiting greenhouse gases . \" Our joint ambitious goal is to have a new , worldwide climate agreement decided which should go into force in 2012 when the present ( text ) expires , \" Merkel said , according to Greenland Radio KNR 's Web site . \" And the United States and China must also be part of it . \" The US and China are the world 's largest emitters of C02 , the gas that causes global warming . \" It made an impression on me to see the icebergs and hear that the glacier has ( retracted ) 15 kilometers in six years , \" Merkel told a news conference late Thursday . She said that the next few years will be decisive in combating climate change . \" We have to make visible what is happening to nature , \" she said . Greenland 's ice is melting faster than anywhere else . The temperature on the island has risen by an average of 1.5 degrees Celsius ( 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) compared to a global average increase during the same period of 0.74 degrees Celsius . ' Merkel Could Go and Stand in the Asian Floods as Well ' But her trip to Greenland has been criticized by opposition politicians , who are dismissing it as a publicity stunt . \" Environmental policies which limit themselves to symbolism are a mistake , \" said Guido Westerwelle , leader of the business - friendly , conservative Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) , in an interview with German public broadcaster ZDF on Friday . Green Party floor leader Renate K\u00fcnast was similarly cool in her reaction to Merkel 's Greenland trip . \" A melting glacier that produces cool pictures -- naturally that is a kind of public relations stunt , \" she told SPIEGEL ONLINE Thursday . \" Merkel could also go and stand in the Asian floods as well . \" She added that she would prefer to have \" more substance \" instead of images from the government . Merkel and Gabriel were joined on their trip to the semiautonomous Danish territory by Danish Prime Minster Anders Fogh Rasmussen . Before heading back to Berlin on Friday , Merkel and Gabriel are going on a helicopter tour to see more glaciers in the area and an American research base . Merkel has been prominent in the push for action in agreeing on a successor to the Kyoto Protocol agreement , which expires in 2012 . She secured a compromise agreement on considering greenhouse gas emission cuts at the G-8 summit in Germany in May , and will be holding a keynote speech at a United Nations climate conference in September . Merkel is also planning a trip to China and Japan at the end of this month , in a bid to get them on board for her climate plans .

Billboard published a record chart measuring jukebox play during the 1950s , which briefly became a component of the Hot 100 ; by 1959 , the jukebox 's popularity had <event> waned <\/event> to the point where Billboard ceased publishing the chart and stopped collecting jukebox play data . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> How The Hot 100 Became America 's Hit Barometer How The Hot 100 Became America 's Hit Barometer Listen at the audio link to Chris Molanphy and NPR 's Audie Cornish talk on All Things Considered about the history of Billboard 's Hot 100 chart . Hear that ? On the radio ? That slick , dreamy crooner dude , singing about how he 's going out of his mind over that girl ? Well , she 's an animal \u2014 baby , it 's in her nature . He used to play around with hearts that hastened at his call . But when he met that little girl , he knew that he would fall . Wait a sec ... what song is this ? Which dreamy dude is this ? What year is this ? Perhaps it 's the first week of August , 1958 , when the top song in America was Ricky Nelson 's \" Poor Little Fool \" \u2014 the first No. 1 song ever on the Billboard Hot 100 . The week Billboard launched what would become the premier singles chart in America , the list was led by the smooth - as-milk Nelson , acting the part of a player who 'd met his match \u2014 bewitched by a woman who , it turns out , is even faster than he is . Fifty - five years later , to the week , we find the Hot 100 topped by \" Blurred Lines , \" a ditty from the smooth - as - milk Robin Thicke . It 's about a player who 's ... bewitched by a woman who 's faster than he is . So , yeah , gender politics in pop music have scarcely evolved in a half - century \u2014 plus \u00e7a change and all that . ( Trust : 28-year - old Ricky Nelson had swag . If he 'd known in 1958 what a music video was , he 'd have shot one with ladies in various states of undress , too . ) The better question is this : How is it that , half a century later , we still follow a chart called the Hot 100 to measure which songs are dominating our earbuds , our streets , our beaches , our dancefloors , our American lives ? We do n't listen to transistor radios anymore , or buy seven-inch 45 - RPM vinyl ( not in quantity , anyway ) . Why is this chart still around ? The Hot 100 was designed to adapt . It 's a voracious creature , built to absorb whatever medium is delivering music to the masses at any given time . It 's not perfect \u2014 any chart where Bob Dylan , Bruce Springsteen and Missy Elliott peak only at No. 2 ca n't be \u2014 but this chart , designed for the music business and followed by pop nerds like me worldwide , is still the best benchmark we have to measure the bigness of hits . Defining our terms : Before dissecting how the Hot 100 came to be the industry standard for pop hitography , let 's answer some basic questions . Is \" the Top 40 \" related to the Hot 100 ? As a term for a radio format that plays current , popular music , \" Top 40 \" dates back to the early ' 50s , before the Hot 100 even existed . But nowadays , when Americans refer to the Top 40 as \" a list of popular songs , \" generally they 're referring to the first 40 songs on the Hot 100 . ( The full list of 100 songs is published in Billboard 's weekly magazine and online . ) Virtually all music critics and chart historians referencing a \" Top 40 hit \" are talking about the Hot 100 's first 40 positions , and if a song is understood to have \" missed the Top 40 , \" it peaked on the Hot 100 at No. 41 or below . This might all seem obvious \u2014 but it should be noted that many radio or TV programs that count down the top 40 , top 20 or top 10 do n't use the Hot 100 . That 's usually because the wide range of genres on Billboard 's big chart are a little too wide for their tastes , falling outside of a station 's target demographics \u2014 an adult - pop station that does n't play rap , for example . For more than 20 years ( 1970\u201391 ) , the national syndicated program American Top 40 with Casey Kasem did actually count down the Top 40 of the Hot 100 ( for Boomers and Gen -X pop nerds , it was paradise ) . But after a 1991 host change , and in response to longtime station complaints about the edgier hits making the chart ( e.g. , \" Me So Horny \" ) , AT40 switched to other , more radio-centric charts for its data . The current edition of AT40 , hosted by Ryan Seacrest , uses an unpublished chart with no direct relationship to Billboard . Is the Hot 100 a \" pop \" chart ? While the term began as an abbreviation for \" popular , \" pop has also come to denote a sugary genre unto itself \u2014 catchy music , usually meant to appeal to young people , tailor - made for the radio and mass consumption . But when we refer to the Hot 100 as \" the big pop chart , \" pop really does mean popular : Billboard will allow onto the Hot 100 any current song , in any genre , that radio is playing or people are buying or streaming . R&B , rap , country , rock , dance and other genres all have their own separate charts , with rules limiting what kind of song is allowed there . But songs of all of these types can and do appear on the Hot 100 . At one time , Billboard got its radio data for the Hot 100 only from stations playing Top 40 music . That 's because , in its ' 60s - to - ' 80s heyday , Top 40 stations really would play a rock song next to a country song next to an R&B song . In our modern world of micro-audience , that 's no longer the case , and the Hot 100 reflects it : For roughly the last 15 years , all current - based radio stations ( i.e. , not classic rock or oldies ) feed into the chart . If your local hip - hop or alt - rock or adult - contemporary or hot- country station is playing current stuff , those plays are tracked on the Hot 100 . What does the date on the Hot 100 mean ? Each week 's Hot 100 chart has a Saturday publication date , and it is a \" week ending \" date \u2014 the chart is meant to cover the seven days up to and including that Saturday . So this year , a baby born on July 29 would by covered by the Hot 100 dated August 3 , 2013 . ( Welcome to the world , \" Blurred Lines \" baby ! ) However , it should be noted that , for both record -keeping and magazine - selling purposes , Billboard stamps its charts with a date in the future , even though the data is from the recent past . This skews timing considerably \u2014 there 's a huge gap between when data is collected for the chart and the week - ending date . You buying a song or hearing it on the radio on a Monday or Tuesday does n't get recorded until early the next week ; it is n't announced by Billboard until a couple of days after that ; it does n't hit newsstands until early the following week ; and its \" week ending \" date is the Saturday after that . So for example , any iTunes -buying or radio-listening you 're doing right now is going to get captured on a chart dated August 17 , 2013 . The pedants among you will want to keep this in mind when you look up \" your \" No. 1 song \u2014 the Billboard chart that lines up with your birthdate reflects data from when Mom was still carrying you . ( I wish this technicality would allow me to say my birth song is really Paul and Linda McCartney 's \" Uncle Albert \/ Admiral Halsey \" and not this forgettable Donny Osmond song , but alas , no matter how I cut it , I 'm stuck with Donny . ) What does \" Number One with a bullet \" mean ? This phrase has so infiltrated popular culture that few know it originated in Billboard ; and even those that know \" with a bullet \" is pop-chart - related have no idea why we 're talking about ammo . It 's actually pretty simple : Billboard puts a circle \u2014 a bullet \u2014 around the chart position of any record that is gaining in chart points and has upward momentum . The Hot 100 was the first major Billboard chart to receive bullets ( at first , in the late ' 50s , they were actually stars , denoting a \" Star Performer This Week \" ) , but now virtually all Billboard charts have bullets . Generally , a song retains its bullet while it 's rising and loses it when the song is slowing at radio or with consumers and , hence , nearing its peak . It 's possible for a song to rise a few positions without a bullet , or fall a couple of places with a bullet \u2014 but generally , you want a bullet , which means your record has an upward trajectory . The ever-popular \" No. 1 with a bullet \" means a record is not only on top of the chart , it 's got upward momentum and will likely stay there for a while since it ca n't go any higher . So that 's a glossary of Hot 100 concepts . But how does the chart actually work ? Radio and sales , the perfect blend : The main thing to keep in mind about the Hot 100 is that it does n't measure just one thing . That is its genius . Many music charts are fairly simple . The album chart , for example \u2014 the Billboard 200 \u2014 is essentially a straight - up ranking of pure sales as tallied by Nielsen Soundscan , with a few minor rules applied regarding which albums qualify .

An enlarged heart ( cardiomegaly ) is n't a disease , but rather a sign of another condition . The term \" cardiomegaly \" refers to an enlarged heart seen on any imaging test , including a chest X -ray . Other tests are then needed to diagnose the condition that 's causing the enlarged heart . Heart damage and certain types of heart disease can cause an enlarged heart . Sometimes short - term stress on the body , such as pregnancy , can cause the heart to get larger . Depending on the condition , an enlarged heart may be temporary or permanent . Treatment for an enlarged heart may include medications , medical procedures or surgery . Symptoms In some people , an enlarged heart ( cardiomegaly ) causes no signs or symptoms . Others may have these signs and symptoms of cardiomegaly : - Shortness of breath , especially while lying flat - Waking up short of breath - Irregular heart rhythm ( arrhythmia ) - Swelling ( edema ) in the belly or in the legs When to see a doctor An enlarged heart may be easier to treat when it 's detected early . Talk to your health care provider if you have concerns about your heart . Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have signs and symptoms of a potential heart attack : - Chest pain - Discomfort in other areas of the upper body , including one or both arms , the back , neck , jaw , or stomach - Severe shortness of breath - Fainting Get the latest health information from Mayo Clinic 's experts .

Sorry something went wrong with your subscription Please , try again in a couple of minutes Causes An enlarged heart ( cardiomegaly ) can be caused by damage to the heart muscle or any condition that makes the heart pump harder than usual , including pregnancy . Sometimes the heart gets larger and becomes weak for unknown reasons . This condition is called idiopathic cardiomyopathy . Conditions associated with an enlarged heart include : - Heart condition present at birth ( congenital heart defect ) . Problems with the structure and function of the heart can cause the heart muscle to get larger and weak . - Damage from a heart attack . Scarring and other structural heart damage can make it harder for the heart to pump enough blood to the body . The strain can lead to heart swelling and eventual heart failure . - Diseases of the heart muscle ( cardiomyopathy ) . Cardiomyopathy often makes the heart rigid or thick . It can make it harder for the heart to pump blood . - Fluid buildup in the sac around the heart ( pericardial effusion ) . A collection of fluid in the sac that contains the heart can cause heart enlargement that can be seen on a chest X -ray . - Heart valve disease . Four valves in the heart keep blood flowing in the right direction . Disease or damage to any of the valves may interrupt blood flow and cause the heart chambers to get larger . - High blood pressure ( hypertension ) . If you have high blood pressure , the heart may have to pump harder to deliver blood to the rest of the body . The strain can cause the heart muscle to grow larger and become weak . - High blood pressure in the arteries in the lungs ( pulmonary hypertension ) . The heart has to work harder to move blood between the lungs and the heart . The strain may lead to thickening or enlargement of the right side of the heart . - Low red blood cell count ( anemia ) . In anemia , there 's a lack of healthy red blood cells to carry proper levels of oxygen to the body 's tissues . The heart must pump more blood to make up for the lack of oxygen in the blood . - Thyroid disorders . Both an underactive thyroid gland ( hypothyroidism ) and an overactive thyroid gland ( hyperthyroidism ) can lead to heart problems , including an enlarged heart . - Too much iron in the body ( hemochromatosis ) . Iron can build up in various organs , including the heart . This can cause the lower left heart chamber to swell . - Unusual protein deposits in the heart ( cardiac amyloidosis ) . This rare disease causes a protein called amyloid to collect in the blood and get stuck in body organs , including the heart . Amyloid protein deposits in the heart cause an irreversible thickening of the heart wall . The heart has to work harder to fill with blood . - Aerobic exercise . In some athletes , the heart becomes enlarged as a response to frequent and prolonged exercise . Usually , this type of enlarged heart is n't considered a disease and does n't need treatment . - Fat around the heart . Some people have extra fat around the heart that can appear on a chest X -ray . Unless there are other heart conditions associated , no treatment is necessary . Risk factors Things that can increase the risk of an enlarged heart ( cardiomegaly ) include : - A family history of heart muscle disease ( cardiomyopathy ) . Some types of cardiomyopathy run in families . Tell your health care provider if a parent or sibling has a history of a thick , rigid or enlarged heart . - High blood pressure . This means having a blood pressure measurement higher than 140\/90 millimeters of mercury . - Heart diseases . Any problem affecting the heart , including congenital heart defects or heart valve disease , may lead to heart enlargement . It 's important to follow a healthy lifestyle and have regular health checkups to manage heart disease . Complications The risk of complications from an enlarged heart depends on the part of the heart affected and the cause . Complications of an enlarged heart can include : - Heart failure . Heart failure may occur if the left lower heart chamber ( left ventricle ) becomes enlarged . In heart failure , the heart ca n't pump the proper amount of blood throughout the body . - Blood clots . Blood clots may form in the lining of the heart . A blood clot that forms on the right side of the heart can travel to the lungs ( pulmonary embolism ) . If a clot blocks blood flow , you could have a heart attack or stroke . - Leaky heart valve ( regurgitation ) . Heart enlargement may prevent the mitral and tricuspid heart valves from closing , causing blood to leak backward . The interrupted blood flow creates a sound called a heart murmur . Although not necessarily harmful , heart murmurs should be monitored by a health care provider . - Cardiac arrest and sudden death . An enlarged heart may cause the heart to beat too fast or too slow . The irregular heartbeat ( arrhythmia ) may lead to fainting , cardiac arrest or sudden death . Prevention Tell your health care provider if anyone in your family has or had cardiomyopathy or other health conditions that caused an enlarged heart . When diagnosed early , proper treatment of the underlying condition may prevent the enlarged heart from getting worse . Following a heart- healthy lifestyle can help prevent or manage some conditions that can lead to an enlarged heart . Take these steps to help prevent an enlarged heart : - Monitor and manage high blood pressure , high cholesterol and diabetes . - Take any prescribed medications as directed . - Eat a nutritious , balanced diet . - Get regular exercise . - Avoid or limit alcohol . - Do n't smoke . - Do n't use illegal drugs . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Protagonist\": [\"Others\"]}"}

As well as relegation to the Football Conference for the first time in the club 's history , the club was in <event> disarray <\/event> off the pitch , entering administration and selling their Abbey Stadium home . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Fans ' Forum There will be a special Fans ' Forum at the U's Supporters ' Club on Tuesday 3rd May where Cambridge United followers will get their first opportunity - since the club filed for administration last Friday - to ask questions to representatives from the board of directors , club officials and football staff . The Forum takes place at 7.30 pm for an 8 pm start . Panellists confirmed so far are Fans ' Director Brian Attmore and new Commercial Director Justyn Medd . The football staff will be represented by Andy Duncan . Early arrival is recommended as capacity at the venue is limited . The full story ... Six days after they were formally relegated from the Football League , Cambridge United Football Club Limited filed in the Chancery Court on Friday morning to enter administration . According to the club 's official website , the decision to file for administration was taken this week \" after a thorough review of the club 's financial situation and detailed discussions with insolvency experts , Grant Thornton . \" | \" It 's been a dreadful season in all ways ... this gives the people of Cambridge and the supporters of Cambridge the chance to start afresh . \" | | Roger Hunt , Cambridge United Chairman | Finance Director Nick Pomery explained : \" The club has liabilities of around \u00a3 900,000 and assets which are in no way sufficient to meet these debts . Our relegation to the Conference , confirmed on Saturday , means that it is not feasible that these liabilities can be paid off by trading profitably over the forthcoming season . We therefore have no choice but to file for administration . \" After such a tumultuous season , this statement wo n't be a surprise to many of the fans . By deciding to file for administration now it means that as the season continues for the U's , they will automatically have ten points deducted ... This of course , makes no difference now they 've been relegated . By doing it now rather than later it means they 'll be on equal terms when they start next season in the Conference . BBC Radio Cambridgeshire 's Sports Editor Jonathan Park explains : \" The administrator 's main aim is to keep the business running . They 'll have a thorough look at what 's going on and where the club are spending money . They 'll have to make some tough decisions and it 's probable that staff will be made redundant and players will be sold . The bottom line is how can the club keep going by spending the least amount of money ... \" It also means people who are owed money by the club may not be paid , although Finance Director Pomery has said that \" suppliers have assurance that any future supplies ordered by administrators will be paid for in full . \" | Roger Hunt | The administrators will also be looking at the rental payments for the ground which they need to meet , currently \u00a3 200,000 a year . This is part of the contract with Bideawhile 445 Ltd who bought the stadium in November 2004 . Minutes after the announcement was made , Sports Editor Jonathan Park spoke to United Chairman Roger Hunt who believes this is a fresh start for the club . He said : \" It 's been a dreadful season in all ways ... this gives the people of Cambridge and the supporters of Cambridge the chance to start afresh . \" Asked whether it 's possible to keep the squad together he said : \" It 's always going to be difficult because we 've only got four players in contract for next season . Like every club , you try and negotiate new contracts - it 's obviously going to be a bit harder going into the Conference , but there are other players that think it 's a good opportunity . \" Regarding the situation with rental payments for the ground , Hunt said : \" It was already paid quarterly in advance which I think expires on the 23rd of June . John Howard has already agreed with the administrator that he will waive the rent completely for the next three months to get us through this period and to help the club come out of administration . So that is a very good gesture , in fairness . \" Responding to a question about the timing of going into administration Hunt said : \" To be really , really honest [ the decision ] should have been taken perhaps when we did n't get the ITV Digital money . We 've struggled on and struggled on and all it 's done is make the spiral even worse and we 've ended up where we have . We should have really taken the decision a lot sooner than we have . \" This large debt was hanging over us , no chance of meeting it , really there was no other alternative . \" Talking about the local companies and suppliers who wo n't be paid Hunt said : \" That has been the main reason for not going into administration before now . Because we are very mindful of these local businesses , most of which do support us very strongly on and off the pitch anyway , and they are true Cambridge United fans . That actually is the hardest pill to swallow and I really ca n't give a satisfactory answer that would suit me , let alone anybody else . \" After a question from a Radio Cambridgeshire listener about where the debt has come from , Hunt said : \" After the ground was sold we did clear all our debts . At that particular time there was a significant shortfall on our gate income and the biggest debt was from Customs and Excise - having sold the ground there was VAT on that sale and that was a big bill . To get through this close season now , with relegation we 've obviously lost a lot of Football League income ... it is impossible , and that is the major creditor . \" Asked what will happen to manager Steve Thompson , Hunt said : \" It 's the administrators decision really . We are working very closely with the administrator , but to be honest it 's a bit too early to call that one and I 'll sit down and talk to Steve first . \" The U's Chairman does n't see this as the end of the club : \" It simply draws the line under a very , very sad season . \" Crisis Timeline : 29th November 2004 : At an emergency meeting , Cambridge United shareholders approved the sale and lease back of the Abbey Stadium for \u00a3 1,923,000 to Bideawhile 445 Ltd. 12th December 2004 : Manager Herve Renard is sacked . 28th December 2004 : Steve Thompson appointed as manager . 17th January 2005 : Cambridge Fans United announce plans to ' Buy back the Abbey ' at their AGM . 29th January 2005 : Cambridge lose a crucial match against Kidderminster , leaving them trailing at the bottom of the League Two table . 31st January 2005 : At the club 's AGM it was revealed that Cambridge United has just 28 days to save itself . Four hours before the meeting a formal offer was made to buy the club by one of the U's directors Johnny Hon . The Hong - Kong born business man along with two associates make an offer to buy a controlling interest in the club . 7th February 2005 : Following Gary Harwood 's decision to step down as Chairman of Cambridge Utd , Roger Hunt takes over the reigns . Gary Harwood continues as a Director at the Abbey . 22nd February 2005 : Thompson 's first win after 11 games in charge . The U's win 1 - 0 at home to Cheltenham . 5th April 2005 : Landlords Bideawhile Limited reject a \u00a3 2.2 m bid to buy the Abbey Stadium . Dr Johnny Hon offers to loan the club the money but Bideawhile director and club vice - chairman John Howard rejects the offer . Cambridge chairman Roger Hunt says he is \" extremely disappointed . \" 15th April 2005 : Dr Johnny Hon resigns from the board of Cambridge United . 23rd April 2005 : Cambridge United are officially relegated from the Football League after 0 - 0 draw with Rochdale . 26th April 2005 : Under-fire Cambridge vice-chairman and land - lord John Howard reassures supporters the Abbey Stadium is in safe hands : \" Football will be played at Abbey Stadium for 50 years , unless the directors and shareholders feel the best thing is to relocate . The ground is safe in the short - term , no matter what people may think . \" 29th April 2005 : Cambridge United Football Club file for administration .

Social efficiency is achieved at the point where the marginal benefits to society for either production or consumption are equal to the marginal costs of either production or consumption . Issues of equity are difficult to judge due to the subjective assessment of what is , and what is not , a fair distribution of resources . Externalities are spillover costs or benefits . Whenever there are external costs , the market will ( other things being equal ) lead to a level of production and consumption above the socially efficient level . Whenever there are external benefits , the market will ( other things being equal ) lead to a level of production and consumption below the socially efficient level . Public goods will be underprovided by the market . The problem is that they have large external benefits relative to private benefits , and without government intervention it would not be possible to prevent people having a free ride and thereby escaping contributing to their cost of production . Monopoly power will ( other things being equal ) lead to a level of output below the socially efficient level . It will lead to a deadweight welfare loss : a loss of consumer plus producer surplus . Ignorance and uncertainty may prevent people from consuming or producing at the levels they would otherwise choose . Information may sometimes be provided ( at a price ) by the market , but it may be imperfect ; in some cases it may not be available at all . Markets may respond sluggishly to changes in demand and supply . The time lags in adjustment can lead to a permanent state of disequilibrium and to problems of instability . In a free market there may be inadequate provision for dependants and an inadequate output of merit goods . Taxes and subsidies are one means of correcting market distortions . Externalities can be corrected by imposing tax rates equal to the size of the marginal external cost , and granting rates of subsidy equal to marginal external benefits . Taxes and subsidies can also be used to affect monopoly price , output and profit . Subsidies can be used to persuade a monopolist to increase output to the competitive level . Lump-sum taxes can be used to reduce monopoly profits without affecting price or output . Taxes and subsidies have the advantages of internalising externalities and of providing incentives to reduce external costs . On the other hand , they may be impractical to use when different rates are required for each case , or when it is impossible to know the full effects of the activities that the taxes or subsidies are being used to correct . An extension of property rights may allow individuals to prevent others from imposing costs on them . This is not practical , however , when many people are affected to a small degree , or where several people are affected but differ in their attitudes towards what they want doing about the problem . Laws can be used to regulate activities that impose external costs , to regulate monopolies and oligopolies , and to provide consumer protection . Legal controls are often simpler and easier to operate than taxes , and are safer when the danger is potentially great . However , they tend to be rather a blunt weapon . Regulatory bodies can be set up to monitor and control activities that are against the public interest ( e.g. anti- competitive behaviour of oligopolists ) . They can conduct investigations of specific cases , but these may be expensive and time consuming , and may not be acted on by the authorities . The government may provide information in cases where the private sector fails to provide an adequate level . It may also provide goods and services directly . These could be either public goods or other goods where the government feels that provision by the market is inadequate . The government could also influence production in publicly owned industries . Government intervention in the market may lead to shortages or surpluses ; it may be based on poor information ; it may be costly in terms of administration ; it may stifle incentives ; it may be disruptive if government policies change too frequently ; it may not represent the majority of voters interests if the government is elected by a minority , or if voters did not fully understand the issues at election time , or if the policies were not in the governments manifesto ; it may remove certain liberties . By contrast , a free market leads to automatic adjustments to changes in economic conditions ; the prospect of monopoly \/ oligopoly profits may stimulate risk taking and hence research and development and innovation , and this advantage may outweigh any problems of resource misallocation ; there may still be a high degree of actual or potential competition under monopoly and oligopoly . There are two views of social responsibility . The first states that it should be of no concern to business , which would do best for society by serving the interests of its shareholders . Social policy should be left to politicians . The alternative view is that business needs to consider the impact of its actions upon society , and to take changing social and political considerations into account when making decisions . This is good business . The virtue matrix is a means of illustrating the drivers of corporate social responsibility . Firms will take socially responsible actions if they are required to by law or if social norms dictate . These pressures on firms represent the civil foundation . Some firms will take corporate social responsibility further and thus move into the frontier . Here they may do things that are socially beneficial and may only possibly lead to higher profits , or may even clearly reduce profits . As firms become more socially responsible over time and as social pressures on business increase , so the civil foundation is likely to grow . Evidence suggests that economic performance is likely to be enhanced as the corporate responsibility of firms grows . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Chosen\": [], \"Time\": [], \"Possibilities\": [\"production\"], \"Cognizer\": [\"people\"], \"Place\": [\"a free market\"]}"}

CNN. <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> 11 Puerto Rican nationalists freed from prison Hearings in Congress next week on Clinton clemency offer September 10 , 1999 WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Eleven members of a militant Puerto Rican nationalist group responsible for a wave of bombings across the United States in the 1970s and 1980s have been released from federal prisons after accepting a controversial clemency offer from President Bill Clinton . The last four prisoners -- Dylcia Pagan , Carmen Valentin , Alicia Rodriguez and Ida Luz Rodriguez -- were released Friday afternoon from a federal prison in Dublin , California . Earlier in the day , seven other prisoners -- Ricardo Jimenez , Alejandrina Torres , Edwin Cortes , Luis Rosa , Elizam Escobar , Adolfo Matos and Alberto Rodriguez -- had been released from prisons in Connecticut , Indiana , Pennsylvania , Kansas , Oklahoma , California and Texas . Those released Friday had served between 14 and 19 years in prison for their role in the terror campaign by the Armed Forces of National Liberation , known by its Spanish acronym FALN . Law enforcement officials say the FALN was responsible for 130 bombings , most in New York and Chicago . 9 will return to Puerto Rico ; 2 to Chicago None of those granted clemency were convicted in any of the actual bombings . Rather , they had been convicted on a variety of charges ranging from bomb making and conspiracy to armed robbery and firearms violations . Nine of the prisoners freed Friday are planning to return to Puerto Rico , while the other two plan to settle in Chicago . All 11 must check in with their parole officers within 72 hours . Of the 16 members of the FALN offered clemency by Clinton , 14 accepted and two refused . Two of the 14 who accepted were already free and had their outstanding fines reduced ; one other member had his sentence reduced but still must serve five more years in a Florida prison before being released . Senate votes Monday on anti-clemency resolution The decision by Clinton to release the convicted FALN members has sparked strong criticism from law enforcement officials and political leaders . The U.S. House approved a resolution opposing the clemency offer on a 311 - 41 vote , with 93 Democrats crossing party lines to oppose Clinton . The Senate will vote on a similar resolution Monday . A draft text condemns the president for a \" deplorable concession to terrorists \" that has \" undermined national security . \" \" There is a feeling of outrage in this country against this action , \" said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott ( R- Mississippi . ) Congress cannot legally override Clinton 's decision on clemency , which is a power granted to the president alone . But Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R- Alabama ) said lawmakers had an obligation to vote for the resolution condemning Clinton 's action . \" When he elevates terrorists over other people who may well deserve pardons much more , or having their sentence cut much more , he has abused his power and abused his office , \" Sessions said . Some leading Democrats , including presidential candidate Bill Bradley and New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan , have also opposed the clemency offer . Clinton : Did n't discuss offer with Hillary Critics have accused Clinton of taking the action to help the expected 2000 New York Senate campaign of his wife , Hillary Rodham Clinton , who is running for Moynihan 's seat . New York is home to a large Puerto Rican community . As the controversy grew , the first lady urged her husband to rescind the clemency offer , a statement which drew the ire of some Hispanic politicians in New York . Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn Thursday evening , Clinton defended his decision and said he did n't discuss the clemency offer with his wife . \" None of them were convicted of doing bodily harm to anyone . And they had all served sentences that were considerably longer than they would serve under the sentencing guidelines which control federal sentencing now , \" he said . \" I did not believe they should be held in incarceration -- in effect -- by guilt by association , \" he said . The political uproar is likely to continue next week when two Senate committees and one House committee plan to conduct hearings on the clemency offer .

Scott of The New York Times criticized the film 's editing , script , and characters . Jon Condit from Dread Central awarded the film a score of 1\/5 , calling it \" a really poor man 's Blood Diamond that just <event> happens <\/event> to also feature an enormous man-eating crocodile \" . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Primeval ( 2007 ) Starring Dominic Purcell , Brooke Langton , Orlando Jones , Jurgen Prochnow , Matthew Collins , Gabriel Malema Directed by Michael Katleman Primeval is \u201c inspired by true events , \u201d a phrase that is really nothing more than modern Hollywood double - speak for \u201c the basic concept behind the movie is based in reality but we 've fictionalized everything else . \u201d Frankly , most modern movies that claim to be inspired by true events are even less fact oriented than your typical \u201c ripped from the headlines \u201d episode of \u201c Law & Order . \u201d In the case of Primeval there really is an impoverished African nation named Burundi that has been involved in a long - standing civil war , and somewhere in this nation 's waterways lurks a monster crocodile that 's eaten a whole lot of people . Everything else presented is pure bunk \u2013 in more ways than one . As the trailers and commercial spots for Primeval have done an excellent job telling us , Gustave is the world 's most prolific serial killer with over 300 kills to his name . The same trailers and commercial spots have gone out of their way to avoid letting us know that Gustave is , in fact , an enormous man-eating crocodile . One has to wonder whether or not the choice to try and keep Gustave 's true nature a secret was a brilliant stroke of marketing or evidence that the studio had little or no faith in getting audiences into theaters to watch a movie about a killer crocodile , even one that 's \u201c inspired by true events , \u201d or that they just knew the film was lousy and decided to unload it into the cinematic dumping ground that is January . The way Hollywood Pictures pulled up stakes and abruptly ( and unceremoniously ) changed Primeval 's release date from April 13th to January 12th with less than two weeks ' notice kind of gave me the vibe that the latter was probably more accurate . Now that I 've seen the film for myself , I 'm positive it had to have been the latter . But first things first . Just who is Gustave ? Having done my own research into the subject matter , I can tell you that Gustave is indeed a killer crocodile that has been terrorizing the riverbanks around Lake Tanganyika in Burundi , Africa . Gustave , who got his name from a French resident of Burundi , is one of the largest crocodiles ever reported at twenty feet in length and weighing around one ton . It 's believed that the three times larger than the average croc Gustave became too big to sustain itself on a typical crocodile diet and thus began eating people . An unconfirmed number claims that Gustave has consumed in excess of 300 fishermen and bathers . Some have tried to capture or kill Gustave only to lose their lives in the process or come away missing a few limbs . And since many of the commercials have gone on the record telling us that Gustave is \u201c still at large , \u201d they 've already done the audience a disservice by more or less telling us how the movie wo n't end . Now that part of the marketing was unquestionably asinine . Well , guess what , everyone ; turns out that the movie 's marketers got us with a double whammy . This movie about a killer crocodile that 's been deceptively marketed as a serial killer flick turns out to not even really be a movie about a killer crocodile . Primeval is really more of a liberal guilt trip thriller about African genocide and how the rest of the world , especially we affluent American honkies , just do n't give a damn about poor black people killing other poor black people . Gustave is more or less the catalyst to get the characters to Africa and only cameos briefly throughout the film . Right when the kill or be killed by Gustave part of the movie should be kicking in , the croc suddenly takes a backseat to the protagonists ' thoroughly lame life or death struggle with the ruthless henchmen of an African warlord . Imagine a really poor man 's Blood Diamond that just happens to also feature an enormous man-eating crocodile ; that 's what Primeval really is . We 'll even be browbeaten at one point with an insipid monologue about how we 're all responsible for the creation of Gustave by not doing anything about the civil wars in Africa . Give me a break ! Dominic Purcell of \u201c Prison Break \u201d fame plays a Network News Channel ( I guess calling it the Network News Network would have just been too hokey for the filmmakers ) producer in hot water after a scandalous story he broke regarding a powerful Senator 's corruption turns out to have been erroneous . The NNC honcho decides to get him out of the country for a while by assigning him to a story about a killer crocodile in Burundi , Africa that just killed a humanitarian aide worker ( as seen in the film 's effective opening sequence ) . His boss does n't just want him to fly to Africa and produce the story ; he wants the croc captured alive in time for sweeps . Purcell is unhappy and thinks this fluff piece is beneath him . Right off the bat we got a major miscasting problem as Dominic Purcell 's physical scruffiness and often surly demeanor make him look and sound more appropriate for the role of a guy competing in the UFC Octagon than a character that is supposed to be a Peabody Award winning television news producer . Anchoring the segment will be the network 's go - to reporter for animal related news items played by The Replacement 's Brooke Langton . Her sole contribution to the film is to provide an easy on the eyes female . I 'm sure it will come as no shock to you to hear that Primeval is yet another one of those movies where the two actors in the group with the least amount of personality get to be the two main characters almost entirely due to their being the most photogenic . Say what I may about the other characters I 'm about to describe , none are as one-dimensionally shallow as those played by Purcell and Langton . Of course , where would we be without the wisecracking black cameraman played by Orlando Jones ? Ugh . Damn near every line of dialogue that comes out of his mouth is meant to be funny , and I 'd reckon that the ratio of stuff he says that actually is humorous is about 20 - to - 1 against . He gets off about three or four that actually elicit a chuckle and one that is legitimately laugh out loud funny , but mostly he 's just obnoxious as the stereotypical wisecracking black sidekick who rarely takes anything seriously , even when face - to - snout with a giant crocodile . When Jones goes off on a comedic tirade about how much he hates Africa , he even tosses out a few lines about how in retrospect slavery was n't a bad thing after all because it got his people out of Africa . It 's embarrassing . As a matter of fact , one especially insulting scene has Jones trying to teach some African bushmen how to do a hip - hop beat with their native drums with no success , prompting his character to utter the line , \u201c This is embarrassing . \u201d Ten bucks says that was an ad lib . Jones ' cameraman also gets to befriend a young African youth in a Nike shirt who speaks English and longs to travel to America . This young man will play a key role in their impending confrontation with armed thugs to the point of factoring into the plot almost more than the giant crocodile does . The NNC trio joins up with the other two more members of their croc hunt upon arriving in Africa . One is an Aussie crocodile hunter clearly based on the late Steve Irwin . The other is Jurgen Prochnow playing one of those roles he can sleepwalk his way through . In this case he 's a local hunter who 'll serve as their tour guide and translator . But mostly he get into arguments with the crocodile hunter because the croc hunter wants to capture Gustave alive in this giant cage they brought , arguing that he wants to protect it from people like Prochnow , and , naturally , Prochnow insists that capture is impossible and the bulletproof ( literally ! ) crocodile must be killed . Guess which one will prove to be correct ? They 've all got bigger problems though . Burundi is in the midst of a civil war , although their NNC boss assured them they 'll be okay because there 's currently a cease - fire . They 'd never know it since their boat is immediately shot at and they are given dire warning that where they are headed is in the vicinity of the local warlord known as \u201c Little Gustave . \u201d He 's such a heartless butcher that he nicknamed himself after the killer croc . He 's also the real villain of the movie \u2013 well , mostly his henchmen are . Orlando Jones will go for a solo walk through the African brush to get some footage of the local scenery and stumble upon some of Little Gustave 's henchmen executing a family . Of course , he gets it on film and , of course , Little Gustave 's men will want that footage back and are willing to kill for it . The group will debate whether or not this footage is the real story they need to cover , not the crocodile , leading to a big discussion about world apathy towards African genocide . I hate to sound apathetic in my own right toward African genocide , but was n't this supposed to be a \u201c nature gone amok \u201d horror flick about a killer crocodile ? Forget the giant , cunning , man-eating crocodile ; Primeval suddenly decides it wants to be a socially conscientious thriller with sporadic appearances by a giant , cunning , man-eating crocodile . The script will devolve to the point that Gustave is just popping up in time to chomp one of the bad guys at just the right moment . Heck , Little Gustave 's thugs even generate more carnage than \u201c the world 's most prolific serial killer \u201d does . But even the few and far between \u201c nature gone amok \u201d moments when Gustave does show up are almost guaranteed to disappoint , not just because the computer generated crocodile often appears obviously so , but because director Michael Katleman and editor Gabriel Wrye have co-conspired to make nearly all the croc attack scenes virtually incomprehensible to watch thanks to the one - two punch of jittery camera work and rapid-fire editing . It 's kind of hard to generate suspense or thrills when you hardly have any idea what is actually happening on the screen . The only moment in the entire movie where you get a really good look at Gustave in action that is n't in any way obscured by either darkness , bad camerawork , or split second editing is near the end when it engages in a foot race in pursuit of Orlando Jones ( despite real - life reports of Gustave being rather slow - moving due to its enormity ) . This was the most suspenseful moment of the movie for me as I was on the edge of my seat hoping that croc would catch Orlando Jones and chomp the hell out of him . Other than that , there 's only one genuine jump scare in the whole film . Now I generally frown on people talking back at the screen in movie theaters , that sort of behavior being a pet peeve of mine that I myself have rarely ever given into . However , I could <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Place\": [\"Primeval\"], \"State_of_affairs\": [\"somewhere in this nation 's waterways lurks a monster crocodile that 's eaten a whole lot of people\"]}"}

February was same month in which his father , Edgar Rice Burroughs , decided to make a full - time career of writing . In fact , ERB dedicated the first novel he wrote , A Princess of Mars , to young John . \" John \" was obviously a favourite name of ERB 's -- as well as giving the name to his youngest son , he also christened his two best-known heroes with the name , and even used it once as a pseudonym : John Tyler McCulloch . The ancestor of whom Ed was most proud was Virginia settler , John Coleman . Coleman was also Ed 's brother 's name . JCB ( Jack ) and his older sister and brother Joan ( pronounced Jo- Anne ) and Hulbert ( Hully ) were all brought up on Tarzan stories and were encouraged to develop a great appreciation for the outdoors and nature . By all accounts ERB was an excellent father and his most prolific and artistic writing period coincided with the period of time when his three children were probably most demanding . He had said , \" Were I literary and afflicted with temperament I should have a devil of a time writing stories ... \" ERB was a complex man who had few real friends , but two of his closest friends and confidantes throughout the rest of his life would be his sons , John and Hulbert . In discussions with them he shared his dislike for any form of organized religion , and often called himself an atheist , but he obviously had a great respect for intelligent reason , humanism and nature . He imparted in his sons a code of love and understanding of wildlife that was over a half century ahead of the current ecological movements . The family went on many outdoor excursions together , the first being a cross - country trip from Chicago to California in 1913 -- Jack was a six-month -old infant at the time . A more rigorous automobile camping tour was undertaken in 1916 . The San Fernando Valley ranch , to which they moved in 1919 , was full of abundant wildlife and the family spent countless hours exploring its rugged untouched terrain , both on foot and horseback -- roaming from Pacific beaches , through arroyos and up mountainsides . The famous ERB Doodad was created during one of their outdoor adventures in the high Sierras in 1924 when Ed sketched it out in the sand on a riverbank . This symbol was to become the famous colophon which appears on most of the ERB books . Each family member , however , had his own special variant of the doodad : Ed 's circle was to the right of the \" spear , \" Hulbert 's circle was below , and Jack 's was to the left . The family embarked on numerous other auto expeditions : the Grand Canyon area in August , 1926 and Death Valley in April 1933 .

This symbol was to become the famous colophon which appears on most of the ERB books .

The family embarked on numerous other auto expeditions : the Grand Canyon area in August , 1926 and Death Valley in April 1933 . The Burroughs family moved to California when Jack was six , and settled on the 550 - acre Harrison Gray Otis , Mil Flores estate , which they re-christened Tarzana . The Burroughs children were constantly exposed to activity and excitement : meeting celebrities , visiting movie sets , horseback riding and motoring with their famous father . Young Jack , perhaps the most sensitive of the three Burroughs children , showed an early aptitude for art and was given his first lessons by his father who himself was quite a good cartoonist . Papa , as Jack called his father , would encourage him by telling him wild tales , showing him the fundamentals of drawing and encouraging his creative interests at every opportunity . Both boys soon were enrolled in LA 's Page Military Academy but when eight - year - old Jack , a sensitive and timid child , could n't adjust to the strict regimen he was pulled out in mid-year and tutored at home for the rest of the year . The boy had nearly died of diphtheria soon after their move to Tarzana and later , in 1921 , both Jack and Hulbert contracted mild cases of polio . As a result , Ed and Emma were worried about them being exposed to diseases in public schools . Around the time that he was being tutored at home , Jack was enrolled , temporarily , in the Hollywood School for Girls . Both boys eventually were enrolled at the Los Angeles Coaching School . Later , Jack attended Urban Military Academy and later , John Burroughs and Van Nuys High Schools , graduating in 1930 . During this schooling period , Jack achieved an early success in creative writing . His father helped him in writing poetry and developing metre . Undoubtedly influenced by his father 's stories , he composed fantastic science fiction serials , devising plots about monsters coming out of the ocean or collisions between planets . He provided his own illustrations for these stories . His interest in drawing had been noticeable several years before , when he began copying or tracing the colourful illustrations made by J. Allen St. John . Other students would wait eagerly to read Jack 's stories and hear each new installment of the serials which he read in class . He was emulating his father 's style of cliffhanger endings . Expanding upon his writing skills , Jack took on the role of sports editor at Van Nuys High School . A curious choice for one who did not like sports at the time . He dreaded writing up the football or basketball games and usually turned in his assignments at the last moment . Born : 6 March 1916 , Oklahoma City One of his best friends at school was Rochelle Hudson , a movie starlet at 13 . Since she lived near Ventura Boulevard , she was often given a ride to school by Jack and Hulbert . Snubbed by most of her schoolmates because of her fame as a movie star , she became a good friend of the Burroughs family and even took vacation trips with them . On one occasion , sixteen - year - old Jack drove Rochelle and her mother on a trip to Oklahoma City . Living so close to Hollywood , coupled with their father 's association with the film industry , offered many advantages to the Burroughs kids . In 1920 a film company gave them lion cubs and monkeys for Christmas . The monkeys turned out to be quite vicious , however , and the lions had voracious appetites -- a more suitable home was soon found for the animals . Ed treated the family and even members of the Hollywood community to regular showings of feature films in the ballroom of a building he had built near the main house . The second story of the building contained a darkroom and ERB 's study which was used as a schoolroom where the children were tutored . Another source of excitement for Jack was the number of films which were shot on location in the canyon on the back of the ranch . ERB 's novel , The Girl from Hollywood , actually presents a thinly veiled description of Burroughs family life on Tarzana Ranch in the twenties . Pursuing his interest in art , John Coleman enrolled in Pomona College in 1930 . Before he left for college , his father had confided that he was not in agreement with much of what colleges stood for and also that he feared that Jack would meet literary people who would deride the Burroughs stories . Ed urged his son not to take these criticisms seriously and repeated statements he often made about his work . He had no pretensions about being a skilled or profound writer ; his sole purpose was to create entertainment for the reader . Jack shared his father 's appreciation of classical art and he worked hard to learn the basic techniques of the old masters . In one of the courses he studied anatomy by dissecting a human cadaver . He recalls working in the \" Biology Department basement at night with children 's big eyes watching me through the high basement window as I worked on my half of the specimen assigned to me . \" Jack was very successful in his four years at Pomona College and he graduated with honours in 1934 ( Phi Beta Kappa , magna cum lauda ) . For his graduate project he acquired some real sabre - tooth tiger bones from the Los Angeles County Museum , which had recovered them from the La Brea tar pits . He then used these bones for inspiration in the creation of a model of a saber - tooth tiger , which was considered an outstanding piece of work and was placed on exhibition at the Los Angeles Art Museum . Influenced by his father 's interest in flying , Jack took weekend flying lessons in 1934 , but it was around this time that his father and mother separated , an event which had a tremendously disruptive effect on the entire family . Ed had often confided in both of his sons as to the difficulties presented to his marriage by their mother 's drinking problem , but the actual separation proved to be a great shock . Hully and Jack moved with mother , Emma , to a house in Bel -Air , a stylish suburb west of Beverly Hills and from then until her death on November 5 , 1944 , they took on much of the responsibility of caring for her . Jack had explained the situation by saying , \" My father was sensitive and idealistic about women . He wanted them to be like his heroines , fine and virtuous . The idea of his wife as a victim of alcohol was difficult for him to accept . His generation thought that drinkiing by women was immoral . \" Although Jack and the rest of the family obviously did not fully approve of Ed 's developing relationship with family friend and one - time movie starlet , Florence Dearholt , he and Florence 's brother , Eddie Gilbert did become good friends . Jack married Pomona classmate , Jane Ralston , on 12 December , 1936 -- they were both 23 years old . Jack and Jane 's first child -- John Ralston -- was born on 22 June , 1942 ( less than two months after Ed 's May 4th divorce from Florence ) . Their second son , Danton , was born on 2 June , 1944 and they later had a daughter , Dian . Today , all three of the children carry on the Burroughs legacy by being actively involved in the arts , entertainment and the running of ERB , Inc . All of Edgar Rice Burroughs ' children were fans of their father 's writing , but only JCB has actually added significantly to ERB 's works with new creative material , although Hulbert was very involved in ERB , Inc.business matters . Since John grew up in an atmosphere saturated by his father 's famous creations , it is not surprising that one of his major influences was J. Allen St. John , who illustrated most of the early ERB works . Nor is it surprising that his first excursions into the professional art world would be influenced by ERB themes . After graduating from Pomona , John did preliminary work , with friend and former Otis Art Institute classmate , Bob Clampett , on an animated version of John Carter of Mars .

A space filled with their culture , the hill played a major part in the hippies ' ability to openly use drugs and express themselves as the police adopted a policy of looking the other way . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> The 21-year - old took a long drag off a cigar - size joint and exhaled , a white cloud of smoke floating around his head . Sunday marked his second year attending 4\/20 , an informal marijuana - focused festival of thousands on Hippie Hill in Golden Gate Park , and Nathan - \" just Nathan \" - had traveled from Salinas to be part of the communal partaking of cannabis . \" Everyone is so nice , \" he said , taking another drag , adding that it was fortuitously Easter , albeit an untraditional acknowledgment of it . \" Everyone is coming together to celebrate something . \" While the vibe in the park was for the most part mellow , city and park officials were keeping a wary eye on the event . They did n't care about the cannabis . They cared about the clogged streets , illegally parked cars and mounds of trash . There were several arrests by late afternoon , according to reports . Last year , the crowds left 10,000 pounds of garbage in their wake and created at - a-standstill traffic jams as the revelers flooded the Haight - Ashbury neighborhood . Supervisor London Breed said she did n't want to be a \" buzzkill . \" But Breed , whose district includes the Haight and the park area , did n't want a repeat of last year 's chaos and two -day cleanup . She noted that smoking anything in any city park is illegal , but San Francisco has a tradition of turning a blind eye to infractions for official or unofficial events . City officials said they would be cracking down on several violations , including structures or canopies , amplified sound , alcoholic beverages , tree climbing , fires , and peddling or vending without a permit . Lenient attitude Yet Hippie Hill and Sharon Meadow below it were covered in canopies , with speakers blaring music , bottles and cans of beer everywhere , an occasional tree climber , several barbecues , and dozens if not hundreds of people selling a range of regular and \" medicinal \" items . \" Lollipops ( laced with cannabis ) , two for $ 5 , \" one entrepreneurial woman yelled . \" Joints for $ 2 . \" \" Chili cheese Cheetos , Doritos , Fritos , \" yelled a man selling the straight snacks . \" I got it right here . Fritos . Cheetos . Boom ! \" So many people were selling pot cookies , pot brownies , pot cupcakes and other bacchanalian treats that sales were pretty slow , many of the impromptu vendors said . \" I 'm pretty baked , so it 's slow going , \" one sucker - selling woman said . Yet there was no visible police presence in the meadow or on the hill . \" Ultimately , we want people to enjoy the park peacefully , \" said Connie Chan , spokeswoman for the Recreation and Park Department . Elias Pizano , 29 , drove from Modesto and arrived at the meadow at 6:30 a.m. , a car - size beach ball in tow . \" It 's like a celebration , \" he said . \" Everybody is happy . \" No place to go That was arguably an overstatement . Among those not happy : people who needed a potty break in the midst of the pot smoking . Because it was a non-sanctioned event , there were n't any portable bathrooms on hand , just a few stalls in permanent park bathrooms and a plethora of trees and bushes to accommodate the 10,000 or so revelers . Similar events were taking place in other cities across the state and country , each hitting its peak at 4:20 p.m. with a shared communal high . Yet the celebration comes as San Francisco and the state continue to grapple with the issue of relaxed laws on marijuana . In San Francisco earlier this month , the City Planning Commission approved restrictions to limit the growth of cannabis dispensaries in the Ocean Avenue neighborhood . California voted to legalize medical marijuana in 1996 . But Gov. Jerry Brown said recently he is watching closely to see how Colorado and Washington handle new laws that regulate the growth and sale of taxed recreational marijuana at state- licensed stores . In San Francisco , officials were more focused Sunday on keeping the temporary cardboard trash cans from overflowing and traffic moving around neighboring streets . Barriers prevented cars from entering the park and from accessing Haight Street . Trash collectors And a handful of park workers on overtime pay mingled with the crowd , picking up trash . As 4:20 p.m. approached , however , trash started to dot the hillside and meadow , despite the numerous recycling and landfill boxes spaced about 30 feet apart . Along the pathway at the bottom of Hippie Hill , where revelers were shoulder to shoulder , vendors Alicia , 30 , and Patrick , 34 - no last names given - held up sizable $ 5 peanut - butter chocolate - chip cookies , each containing an estimated half - gram of marijuana . They had few takers . \" We 're not coming back next year , \" said Patrick , adding they had come from Stockton . \" Too much of a hassle . \" Behind them was a cooler filled with most of the 150 individually vacuum - packed cookies they had made . \" We 're gonna end up eating and passing out whatever 's left , \" Patrick said with a shrug .

Yepuri , MD , MS Facebook Linked In Twitter Jay Yepuri , MD , MS , is a board - certified gastroenterologist and a practicing partner at Digestive Health Associates of Texas ( DHAT ) . Learn about our Medical Expert Board Print The endometrium is one of the stars of the female reproductive system , playing key roles during the menstrual cycle as well as during pregnancy . Also called the endometrial lining , the tissue it 's made up of serves as the \" wallpaper \" of the uterus , or womb \u2014 the pear-shaped organ that houses a developing baby . Abnormalities of the endometrium can result in concerns such as endometriosis , hyperplasia , and cancer . Garry DeLong \/ Getty Images Anatomy The endometrium is made up mostly of mucosal tissue . It has two layers . The first layer , the stratum basalis , attaches to the layer of smooth muscle tissue of the uterus called the myometrium . This layer serves as an anchor for the endometrium within the uterus and stays relatively unchanged . The second layer is dynamic , however . It changes in response to the monthly flux of hormones that guide the menstrual cycle . For this reason , it 's called the stratum functionalis , or functional layer . It 's the part of the endometrium where a fertilized egg ( or blastocyst ) will implant if conception takes place . Menstruation and Pregnancy Just before ovulation ( the release of an egg from a fallopian tube ) , the functional layer of the endometrium goes through specific changes . Structures called uterine glands become longer and tiny blood vessels proliferate \u2014 a process called vascularization . As a result , the endometrial lining becomes thicker and enriched with blood so that it 's ready to receive a fertilized egg and also support a placenta \u2014 the organ that develops during pregnancy to supply a fetus with oxygen , blood , and nutrients . If conception does n't take place after ovulation , the build - up of blood vessels and tissues becomes unnecessary and is shed . This is your period . Menstrual flow is made up of the cells that slough away from the functional layer of the endometrial lining , mixed with blood from the little blood vessels that surrounded the uterine glands . Keep in mind that those too young to have gotten their periods yet and adults who 've gone through menopause will not experience these changes . Their endometrial linings will stay relatively thin and stable . Hormonal birth control methods can have a similar effect . People who use progesterone - only contraception such as the Mirena intrauterine device or the contraceptive implant Nexplanon , both of which ultimately suppress the build - up of the functional layer of the endometrium , tend to have lighter periods . Endometrial Conditions Most of the time , the ebb and flow of the endometrial lining follow a fairly predictable rhythm \u2014 as you well know if you 're a person who menstruates . However , this can be altered by abnormalities of the endometrial lining . Here are the most common ones women may experience . Endometriosis Sometimes as it thickens , the endometrial lining wanders outside of the borders of the uterus and builds upon the ovaries , fallopian tubes , or tissue that lines the pelvis . Even though it 's outside of the uterus , this tissue will continue to grow and then break down as you menstruate . The problem is because it is displaced , the blood and tissue have nowhere to exit the body and become trapped . Eventually , endometriosis can lead to cysts on the ovaries called endometriomas , as well as scar tissue and adhesions that cause structures in the pelvis to stick together . The main symptom is severe pain \u2014 not only during menstruation but also during intercourse , bowel movements , or urination . Periods may be heavy , and you may feel extra tired , bloated , or nauseous . Endometriosis can be treated with medication , hormone therapy , or surgery , but may still affect fertility . About 40 % of people who have endometriosis will have some degree of infertility resulting from any number of complications , such as scar tissue and adhesions in and around the fallopian tubes to low levels of progesterone that can affect the build - up of the uterine lining \u2014 a condition called luteal phase defect . Endometrial Hyperplasia In this condition , the endometrial lining becomes too thick . This most often happens due to a specific hormonal imbalance . An excess of estrogen , which causes the thickening of the endometrium , in combination with an absence of progesterone that can result if ovulation does n't take place . Under these conditions , the endometrial lining is n't shed and cells within it continue to proliferate . Endometrial hyperplasia can occur during perimenopause when ovulation becomes irregular , or after menopause , when the menstrual cycle stops altogether . It also can happen in people who take medications that act like estrogen ( without progestin or progesterone ) or who take high doses of estrogen after menopause for a long period of time . Other risk factors include irregular menstrual periods , particularly in people who have polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) , are infertile , or are obese : Excess fat cells produce excess estrogen as well . This can lead to an extra buildup of the endometrium and , ultimately , heavier periods . The symptoms of endometrial hyperplasia include menstrual bleeding that 's heavier or lasts longer than usual ; shorter than normal periods ; or any bleeding after menopause . If you experience any of these symptoms , see your gynecologist . Endometrial hyperplasia can put you at risk of endometrial cancer , as the excess cells can become abnormal . The condition is usually treated with progestin . Cancer Endometrial cancer is caused by the growth of abnormal cells . About 90 % of people who are diagnosed with this condition have abnormal vaginal bleeding . Other possible symptoms of endometrial cancer include non-bloody vaginal discharge , pelvic pain , feeling a mass in your pelvic area , or unexplained weight loss . According to the American Cancer Society , when diagnosed early ( at stage 0 ) , the five - year survival rate for treated endometrial cancer is 96 % . If your periods change dramatically ( they become heavier or last longer , for example ) or you have bleeding between periods or after you go through menopause , see your healthcare provider . There are less serious causes for these symptoms , but it 's better to err on the side of caution . Was this page helpful ? Thanks for your feedback !

The company was <event> bought <\/event> 6 months later by investors Lawrence Hebner , Donald Kline , and Donald Jasper for $ 300,000 . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> This story appears in the June 23 , 2013 issue of Forbes . Subscribe We always look back and say , ' Why did we ever get involved in the water business ? ' \" says Lawrence Hebner . In 1987 , when he and fellow investors Donald Kline and Donald Jasper acquired Talking Rain , a tiny , unprofitable beverage company , they did n't realize how long -- and pocked -- a road it would be to prosperity . Their recent success is a shock given the long stretch of false starts and outright failures . Ah , sweet vindication . Over the last three years the company 's zero-calorie fizzy water , Sparkling ICE , has kept it from folding -- and blasted revenue from $ 25 million in 2010 to $ 148 million in 2012 . Talking Rain , based in Preston , Wash . , pulled in $ 50 million in the first quarter , and claims it 's profitable . Now available in all 50 states , Sparkling ICE accounts for 95 % of sales . \" We pinch ourselves every day , \" says Talking Rain CEO Kevin Klock , 44 . He should : It 's taken the company longer to reach this point than Odysseus needed to battle the Trojans and make his way home . \" For a long time nobody believed the numbers , which is fine -- it just allowed us to continue to take market share . \" Hebner , now 72 , had no business getting involved in the first place . A onetime broker for Dean Witter in Seattle , he 'd known Kline , 75 , and Jasper , 74 - - both home builders and real estate investors -- since 1970 . He 'd gotten them into various stocks , then into commercial properties . When they stumbled across Talking Rain , it was a six-month-old company that produced carbonated water , rode on the back of a The trio took a majority stake for $ 300,000 . Three months later , having burned through the first $ 110,000 payout , Stevens and Hiskin came back for more . The investors decided to take over , buying out Hiskin but keeping Stevens to head up marketing and product development . Talking Rain capitalized on Perrier 's global recall in 1990 , pitching its brand as a replacement in the price club Costco . That connection paid off again in 1993 , when the retailer began selling the newly created Sparkling ICE -- an imitation of Clearly Canadian 's lightly flavored sparkling waters . The company achieved meager profitability around 1995 . It took a stab at spreading Sparkling ICE and seltzer water beyond the Northwest in 1996 , leveraging Costco stores in California and BJ's in New Jersey to invade grocery chains in those states . After spending over $ 1 million with little success , Talking Rain retreated . Time for plan B. Investing in a larger sales force , the company made another plunge to take two new drinks , Twist and Active Water , to the national market , spending about $ 35 million of the investors ' stash between 2006 and 2010 - - losing an undisclosed amount of money . Both products failed to catch on . Twist , a lightly flavored water , did n't excite taste buds , and Active Water , a vitamin-enriched beverage , was far outpaced by Coke 's Vitaminwater and Pepsi 's SoBe Lifewater . The two drinks were dropped from over half of their 4,132 retailers , as well as by 20 of their 50 distributors . By mid-2010 Talking Rain was months away from shrinking to a regional brand -- or going under . Its CEO , president and head of sales all left within six weeks . The investors turned to Klock , then the vice president of operations . He and his team had an inspiring , if desperate , thought : Put the company 's remaining resources behind a dark horse , Sparkling ICE , and take it national . The carbonated flavored water had enjoyed success in the Northwest since 1992 . Could it catch on ? After tinkering with taste , mouth -feel , flavors and packaging , Talking Rain took its drink to distributors through its reconstituted sales team . National grocer With proof of surging interest , the sales team persuaded retailers to swap out Twist and Active Water with Sparkling ICE . In 2011 Talking Rain generated $ 60 million in revenue , up 140 % from the year before . \" We targeted 39 of the top 40 retailers in the U.S. when we got into 2011 , \" says Klock . \" And by 2012 we had all but one . \" Talking Rain has more than tripled its employee base in the last three years to 209 and has 40 or so open positions . \" We 're starting to blanket the country with salespeople , \" says Klock . This summer it will launch its first ad campaign , a $ 15 million push that includes national television commercials as well as billboards and building - side spectaculars in 14 markets . ICE will also sponsor the LPGA , putting the brand before the golf tour 's national TV audiences this summer . Those viewers --a 50\/50 split of men and women in the 35 - and - up demographic -- could mean a slew of new converts for Sparkling ICE . What does this so-long - in - coming payday mean for the investors ? Talking Rain revenues are now on a par with what the construction businesses pull in for Kline and Jasper . \" This was always a little game everybody was playing , \" shrugs Hebner , who is retired from his own brokerage business . \" No matter what happens to this company , it 's not going to change any of our lives . \" Follow me on Twitter @ KarstenStrauss <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [\"In 1987\"], \"Buyer\": [\"he and fellow investors Donald Kline and Donald Jasper\"], \"Goods\": [\"Talking Rain , a tiny , unprofitable beverage company\"], \"Place\": [\"Preston , Wash\"]}"}

Exten Ze faced legal actions by both of Conway 's Cup Series teams in 2010 , Front Row Motorsports and Robby Gordon Motorsports , after Exten Ze allegedly <event> paid <\/event> neither team 's sponsorship money . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Sam Cranston NASCAR Illustrated Sam Cranston NASCAR Illustrated Front Row Motorsports is suing its former driver Kevin Conway and his sponsor Biotab Nutraceuticals , which sells Extenze , over alleged non- payment of part of a $ 5.4 million sponsorship deal for Conway to drive a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series car in 2010 . The lawsuit was filed Monday in North Carolina Superior Court in Charlotte . A Front Row Motorsports spokesman declined to comment on the lawsuit , which asks for damages to cover the $ 2.754 million that will eventually be due under the terms of the contract , payment of $ 734,201 in sponsorship fees , hard card fees , race licenses and other expenses for services rendered and $ 135,000 advanced to Conway as part of his base compensation . \u201c It 's really unfortunate that they 've made some pretty outrageous allegations against us and the good thing is we 'll have our day in court , and the truth will all come to light in the months ahead , \u201d Conway said in a phone interview Tuesday . \u201c Unfortunately , I ca n't really comment on the specifics . \u201d According to the complaint and contracts attached as exhibits , Extenze was to pay Conway 's marketing company Exclaim $ 5.4 million in 50 weekly installments of $ 108,000 , and that money was then to be sent to the race team . The $ 5.4 million was designed to cover the first 15 races , and then Extenze would have the option of funding the remaining 21 events through revenues generated by a product placement contract . The team would get 15 percent for product placement at dollar stores , retail stores or wholesale auto parts stores . Conway 's base compensation , according to a contract that is an exhibit in the lawsuit , was $ 540,000 plus 10 percent of any other sponsorships brought in for the car . He also would get paid 15 percent of all purse money and season point fund money , with the percentage increasing to 30 percent for any top - 20 , 35 percent for a top - 10 and 45 percent for a top-five . Front Row was obligated to put Conway in a car that was in the top 35 in owner points , and if he failed to make the field in two consecutive races or any three during the season , the contract could be terminated . The deal between Conway and Front Row went sour during the summer , according to the complaint , when Exclaim allegedly began paying only half of its $ 108,000 payments beginning June 21 . Exclaim is also listed as a defendant in the lawsuit . \u201c [ Exclaim ] represented that Biotab was experiencing cash flow problems due to the payment of a settlement to resolve an unrelated lawsuit against Biotab , \u201d Front Row 's complaint states . Front Row notified Conway on Aug. 8 that he would not be back in the car beginning with the Aug. 15 race at Michigan if his sponsor could not pay its $ 108,000 weekly fee . Conway did not compete at Michigan but then ran the next three events for Robby Gordon Motorsports . He is scheduled to run seven of the final 10 events for RGM but will not be in the car this weekend because team owner Robby Gordon has sponsorship for the New Hampshire race . Conway had struggled in his rookie season with three lead - lap finishes in 23 starts driving for Front Row . But as the only rookie competing fulltime , he is on pace to win the rookie award . If he ever fell 300 points behind any other rookie , he could terminate the deal with Front Row . The lawsuit was filed by Charlotte attorney Ron Skufca , who represents the North Carolina - based Front Row Motorsports . Biotab is based in California . \u201c It 's somewhat of a distraction for everybody , but it 's something that will certainly be sorted out , \u201d Conway said . \u201c We 'll have our day in court . \u2026 It 's not interfering with our 2011 plans or the rest of 2010 in any way . \u201c We 're really excited about 2011 and some announcements that are going to be forthcoming next month detailing our plans .

Expansion of Sales Systems in Japan and Development of Markets in Other Countries Item 4 . Exports of Completely - built Vehicles Exports to Scandinavia began with a sample shipment of two Tiaras to Finland in June 1962 , marking the start of Toyota 's advance into Europe , but nothing went beyond the sample shipment . The trigger of a full - scale entry by Toyota vehicles into European markets was the ninth Tokyo Motor Show held in October of that year . President W. Krohn of Erla Auto Import A\/S , a Danish dealer of imported vehicles , was in Japan and noticed the Crown ( RS40 ) that was on display at the show . He had a feeling that the subdued styling of the Crown would suit European tastes and decided to obtain exclusive sales rights for the Crown in Denmark . President Krohn exhibited the Crown in three major cities in Denmark in December of that year and generated a tremendous reaction . A distributor agreement was concluded with Erla Auto Import in May 1963 , and full - scale exports to the European market began with the loading on a ship of 190 Crowns . The start of exports to Denmark led to a distributor agreement being signed with Louwman & Parqui B.V. of the Netherlands in May 1964 , marking the start of Toyota 's entrance into mainland Europe . Initially , Erla Auto Import was also responsible for sales in Sweden and Norway , but local distributors were later established in these countries . In 1966 , Toyota used non-automobile producing countries such as Belgium and Switzerland as footholds to establish sales bases in automobile - producing countries including the United Kingdom , France , and West Germany . Complete-knockdown production of Toyota vehicles in Europe was commenced by Portugal - based Salvador Caetano I.M.V.T. , S.A. in 1968 . With the strengthening of its foundations for sales in Europe in the late 1960s , Toyota 's sales grew rapidly . At the time , Japanese vehicles were at a price disadvantage because of the freight charges for the long transport distances and customs duties , but they offered the advantages of including a lot of equipment as standard and incurring few breakdowns , which meant that maintenance costs were low , and as a result , the competitiveness of Japanese vehicles steadily increased . As exports to Europe gained momentum , a representative office was established in Brussels , Belgium in August 1970 to gather information on automotive - related laws and regulations in each country and to conduct development of products suited for European markets . As for Canada , export to the country did not make much headway due to the specifications required for the harsh , cold climate , as well as the imposition of high import duties . Finally in 1965 , exports of the Crown , Publica , and Land Cruiser began , with Canadian Motor Industries as the distributor . Specifications for the extreme cold , however , were not adopted , and sales were extremely poor . In order to develop products suitable for Canada 's harsh climactic conditions , Toyota conducted repeated testing in cold weather regions . In February 1967 , a cold - weather region test team comprising two Corollas and one Corona crossed the snow - covered Canadian continent from west to east , driving in extremely cold conditions with temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees centigrade . This experience was put to use in improving vehicles for Canada and Scandinavia . Cold - weather testing has been conducted in Canada every year since test sites were established in Wawa and Cochrane in Ontario Province in 1973 . By improving products based on these harsh cold - weather tests and developing sales networks , exports to Canada increased from 2,000 units in 1967 to 29,000 units in 1970. <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Buyer\": [], \"Goods\": [\"of two Tiaras\"], \"Place\": [\"Finland\"], \"Time\": [\"1962\"], \"Seller\": [\"Toyota\"]}"}

The information they provided , which in some cases includes actual photo copies of available documentation , is not in exact agreement with the account of the episode in Geoffrey Ward 's \" Jazz : A History of America 's Music . \" There has been sporadic but extensive discussion in the Forum of Bix 's alcohol addiction and of Ralph Berton 's claim of a homosexual fling between his brother Eugene and Bix . Ralph Berton 's unsupported claim of a homosexual encounter between Gene Berton and Bix has been used by some individuals to create a whole scenario in which Bix 's addiction to alcohol was caused by a deep - seated guilt complex that had its roots in an event that took place during the early part of Bix 's life . The exact nature of the event was not known . Sudhalter writes in \" Lost Chords \" that there is some documentation that has been carefully hidden from the public that \" records an event deemed serious enough , at least in the context of the early ' 20s , to have kindled Bismarck Beiderbecke 's indignation . \" \" The facts remain closely guarded and cannot be discussed here without betrayal of confidences . \" I have expounded on the need to separate Bix 's private from his public life and have strongly argued that his rights to privacy must not be desecrated . Unfortunately , my plea - and those of others - have been disregarded . A short account of the episode that took place in Davenport in 1921 is included in the recent book \" Jazz : A History of America 's Music by Geoffrey C. Ward ( the book associated with Ken Burns ' PBS special ) . I find it highly distasteful to provide the following information because it goes against my principles against violation of privacy . However , in the interest of making the Bixography the most comprehensive source of data about Bix and of putting an end to innuendoes and uncorroborated hypotheses , I am compelled , unwillingly , to provide the following account . Ward 's book is in the public domain , and therefore I offer a verbatim quote from p. 83 of that book . \" By the age of eighteen , Bix was good enough to play alongside older musicians - and to join them behind the bandstand between sets to sip corn whiskey and bootleg gin . At nineteen , he was arrested for what the Davenport police blotter called a \" lewd and lascivious act with a child \" - apparently just a fellow teenager , a girl from down the street . The case never reached court but the scandal must have been humiliating to him and his family . \" \" They [ Bix 's parents ] had always wanted their boy to go to Princeton , and in the autumn of 1921 , evidently hoping to force him to focus on his studies and wean him away from jazz and the bad habits they believed went with it , they packed him off to Lake Forest . \" I want to briefly make two points . First , I note an error in Ward 's account : Bix was eighteen , not nineteen in 1921 , when the alleged incident took place . Second , and most importantly , the event does not provide any support whatsoever for allegations of Bix 's homosexuality . This is important because some individuals had cited this event - without having any knowledge of its nature - as evidence for a proposed link between Bix 's alcohol addiction and Berton 's undocumented claim of a homosexual encounter . Albert Haim I am caught between strong contradictory forces . On the one hand , my ethical principles compel me to scrupulously guard Bix 's - and anybody 's - private affairs from public scrutiny and speculation . On the other hand , my rigorous training as a research scientist drives me to vigorously investigate and search for the \" truth \" . After a lot of soul searching and in the interest of fairness , accuracy , completeness , and final closure , I decided to post here transcriptions of the only two available documents - the Davenport police blotter for April 22 , 1921 and the grand jury deposition of Preston R. Ivens , the father of the girl in the incident . In addition , and with his permission , I also provide the essence of a conversation I had with Geoffrey C. Ward , the author of \" Jazz : A History of America 's Music \" , the companion book to Ken Burns ' Jazz TV series for PBS . I have seen photographs of the two documents mentioned above . The Davenport police blotter for 1921 still exists and has been archived . I have been informed that the Scott County proceedings prior to 1940 have been purged . Copies of the deposition had been obtained many years ago . Police Blotter [ April 1921 ] . [ Exact transcription from photograph of original document . ] Date - 22 ; Name , Leon Beiderbecke ; Arrested By , Len & Halligan ; Crime , Lewd & lascivious act with child ; Age , 18 ; height , 5 - 7 ; Complection [ sic ] , Dark ; Occupation , Student ; Nationality , Am ; Remarks , Held to G.J. [ grand jury ] $ 1500 bond - Scott Court . [ Note : My understanding is that Bix was close to six feet tall and of light complexion . ] Deposition . State of Iowa vs. Beiderbecke . [ Exact transcription from photograph of original document . ] Preston R. Ivens being first duly sworn on oath says : I live at 3030 Grand Ave. Davenport- Scott County , Iowa . I am a student at the Palmer School . On April 22 , 1921 my little girl came home , told me that a man took her in the garage , said some awful things to her . I ran up to the garage , then called up the police but could get no clue . Next day I saw 2 boys whom I had seen when I went to the garage . I asked if they saw a man take a little girl into the garage the day before . They said yes & told me it was the Dft [ defendant ] . My little girl told her story to me & later to the chief of police & the County Attorney . She said he asked her to show herself . The little girl is 5 years old . In consideration of the childs [ sic ] age & the harm that would result to her in going over with this case I would request that no action be taken by the Grand Jury . I consulted with Dr. Eliot & Dr. B. J. Palmer & Dr. Craven & they all besides Mr. C. H. Murphy thought it best to drop the case for the betterment of the child . Signed : Preston R. Ivens . [ Note : Palmer School of Chiropractic is still in existence ; Mr. Ivens did not complete the program . The Ivens 's residence was about 15 blocks away from the Beiderbecke 's residence . ] I had a telephone conversation with Geoffrey C. Ward , the author of \" Jazz : A History of America 's Music \" on December 18 , 2000 . Mr. Ward informed me that the data about Bix 's arrest for \" lewd and lascivious act with a child \" was from a photograph of the Davenport police blotter for April 22 , 1921 . No information about the age and sex of the child was provided in the blotter . The identification of the child as \" apparently just a fellow teenager , a girl from down the street \" was provided to Mr. Ward by the late Mr. Philip Evans during a telephone conversation several years ago . \" This is all I know about the episode of April 1921 . As far as I am aware , there are no other serious events in Bix 's life that have not been disclosed . I believe that this is the sum total of material that has not been in the public domain . I will not analyze the documents nor will I speculate about their meaning or some of the puzzling aspects . However , some clarifications are in order . For the benefit of readers from overseas , I give a brief and general explanation of the Grand Jury system in the U.S.A . The rules vary from state to state , but some features are common . Basically , when an individual is arrested , depending on the nature of the charges , he \/ she may be bound over to a Grand Jury . The Grand Jury is a group of about twenty citizens called to determine whether evidence exists to warrant the trial ( by a Petit Jury , 12 men \/ women who decide on the guilt or innocence of the defendant ) of a person accused of a crime . Unlike the trial by a Petit Jury , Grand Jury proceedings are secret . The only person present during depositions by witnesses and by the defendant is the District Attorney . Witnesses and accused testify one at a time behind closed doors . There is no judge present . After the jurors are sworn in , the indictments proposed by the District Attorney are laid before them and witnesses are called . The defendant may be called , provided he \/ she waives his privilege against self- incrimination . On the conclusion of the hearing , the Grand Jury deliberates in private and decides whether the evidence provides reasonable cause to believe that the defendant committed the crime of which he is accused . Of course , the Grand Jury can decide that insufficient evidence has been presented and the case is dismissed . When the proceedings are concluded in favor of the defendant , the records are sealed . This means that they are not available to anyone without a Supreme Court order on good cause shown . Clearly , Bix was arrested , released on bail , and his case was sent over to the Grand Jury . The case was dismissed . Those are the facts . What are the claims ? According to Mr. Ivens , his daughter told him that an unidentified man said \" something awful \" to her and asked her \" to show herself . \" What is the basis for the allegation by Mr. Ivens that the man was Bix ? Apparently , only the word of two unidentified boys seen by Mr. Ivens near \" the garage . \" Clearly , all the evidence brought in by Mr. Ivens was nothing but hearsay . The charges were dismissed and <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Perpetrator\": [\"Leon Beiderbecke\"], \"Crime\": [\"Lewd & lascivious act with child\"], \"Time\": [\"On April 22 , 1921\"], \"Place\": [\"in the garage\"]}"}

However , many American strategists now argue that even light , token US land forces -- ' getting US combat boots on the ground ' as General Warner puts it -- would <event> signal <\/event> to an enemy that the US is physically guarding the area and can only be dislodged at the risk of war . \" <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> How do you speed a large US ground force over 12,000 miles of ocean and air space to the Persian Gulf , and then support it there without permanent land bases nearby ? The problem is confronting the new US military planning group meeting here in an effort to solve it . Since being formed at this base near Tampa , Fla. , March 1 , the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force ( RDJTF ) -- 253 men and women from the Army , Navy , Air Force , and Marine Corps -- has been puzzling over a solution night and day . \" The Iran hostage crisis is breathing down our necks , \" says one aide to the RDJTF 's Marine commander , Lt. Gen. Paul X. ( PX ) Kelley . Fighting between Iran and Iraq , which could endanger US oil supplies , and new threats to the lives of US hostages in Tehran have kept up the pressure . It 's still too early , says four - star Army Gen . Volney F. Warner , to tell whether US access to bases in Kenya and somalian , and other facilities closer to the Persian Gulf already being used in Oman , can be of lasting value . Except at Diego Garcia , in mid-Indian Ocean , the arrangements for US bases have not been finalized . In an interview with ABC News in Washington , Egyptian President Sadat April 9 offered the US bases in Egypt to defend what he called \" shaky \" Arab regimes in the Gulf . So far , the US has operated only flying radar planes and has no combat planes based in either Egypt or the Gulf region . General Warner is commander of the older US Readiness Command , of which the new RJDTF is a part . He has long experience in airborne combat and guerrilla - type operations in southeast Asia . He has done top-level Army planning in Europe and the US , and commanded the XVIII Airborne Corps , which includes the 82nd Airborne division and other US rapid intervention forces . In an interview with the Monitor , General Warner mapped out these strategic problems for the US : * It is too late for any massive airborne raid into IRan to rescue the American hostages . \" If you decide the lives of hostages comes first , \" he says , \" that puts you in a situation where you should n't repudiate force at the outset . You should wait until later in the game . . . . But I 'm confident that we have military organizations that are expert at this [ special or covert guerrilla operations ] , and that we have options . \" General Warner did not say so , but the RDJTF could use Army , Marine , Air Force , or Navy special forces with such training . The US must more clearly define its \" vital interests \" ( President Carter 's phrase in his January State of the Union speech ) in the Middle East . \" If it 's the oil - producing area , then we need to circumscribe it , literally , in a military sense . \" * US options grow more difficults as the chance of a Soviet response increases . However , many American strategists now argue that even light , token US land forces -- \" getting US combat boots on the ground , \" as General Warner puts it -- would signal to an enemy that the US is physically guarding the area and can only be dislodged at the risk of war . * Airlift alone to move major US forces to the Persian Gulf would require months . A combination of sea and airlift would require 45 days . \" And once forces are there , how do you sustain them ? \" he asks . \" You need about 12 gallons of water alone , per man and per day ; and 12 gallons of oil , too . \" * Retaining large US land forces in the region requires an immense supply line . \" We do n't have any readily identifiable new ports , such as we used in Vietnam , \" recalls General Warner . ( Some of these Viet ports now are used by the Soviets for their Indian Ocean supply lines . ) * Personnel replacements would become urgent . \" Your men end up looking over their shoulder for help . We get faced with a limited mobilization of reserve and National Guard forces and they 're just not adequate to the task . \" * Present front-line US armored equipment like the M - 60 main battle tank is too heavy to move easily to the Mideast by air . Since the 1973 Arab - Israel war , Soviet military - aid programs have provided large numbers of high - grade Soviet armor , like the T-62 and T-72 tank and light - armored fighting vehicles , to nearby Soviet friends ( like syria ) or customers ( like Iraq ) . The US might meet this threat by using high - technology weapons producing more effect with less weight and bulk , like rocket and laser systems . However , General Warner says : \" To send a lighter tank up against a Soviet T-72 , just because you can get your light tank there , and have a shootout in which your tank loses its turret , is not going to be very useful either . \" A force sent to a remote area like the Gulf , General Warner says , \" must be tailored to the mission and potential threat , not to the means used to get there . \" Prepositioning of equipment on land -- as now is being done on a large scale in NATO Europe -- or on ships in the Indian Ocean , which the Defense Department has promised to do by June , are only \" Band - Aids \" and poor substitutes for lack of mobility . To increase mobility , the US must build the proposed new giant CX long - range transport plane , General Warner says . It also needs a fleet of rapid troop and cargo ships , which , like the CX , appear in the proposed five - year US defense plan . The bottom line , as read from the observations of General Warner and others here , seems to be : \" Do n't get involved in any land war in south Asia -- Iran , Pakistan , or the Gulf -- where superior Soviet forces could swiftly and massively respond . \" Do put at least token American land forces on dry land in the area . This would prove that the big seaborne US task force now cruising is not an empty gesture and [ some planners believe ] could deter possible adversaries , such as Iran , from opening hostilities . \" <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Topic\": [], \"Time\": [], \"Place\": [\"the Persian Gulf\"], \"Communicator\": [\"The US\"], \"Medium\": [\"getting US combat boots on the ground\"], \"Message\": [\"the US is physically guarding the area and can only be dislodged at the risk of war\"]}"}

For disrespecting and humiliating her , she curses the men of Ulster to be overcome with weakness \u2014 as weak \" as a woman in childbirth \" \u2014 at the time of their greatest need . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> The Debility of the Ulstermen There lived on the heights and in the solitudes of the hills a rich cow-lord of the Ulstermen , Crunnchu mac Agnoman by name . In his solitude great wealth accumulated to him . He had four sons around him . His wife , the mother of his children , died . For a long time he lived without a wife . As he was one day alone on the couch in his house , he saw coming into the mansion a young stately woman , distinguished in her appearance , clothing , and demeanor . Macha was the woman 's name , as scholars say . She sat herself down on a chair near the hearth , and stirred the fire . She passed the whole day there , without exchanging a word with any one . She fetched a kneading - trough and a sieve and began to prepare food . As the day drew to an end she took a vessel and milked the cow , still without speaking . When she returned to the house , she turned right about , went into his kitchen and gave directions to his servants ; then she took a seat next to Crunnchu . Each one went to his couch ; she remained to the last and put out the fire , turned right about again and laid herself down beside him , laying her hand on his side . For a long time they dwelt together . Through his union with her , he increased yet more in wealth . His handsome appearance was delightful to her . Now the Ulstermen frequently held great assemblies and meetings . All , as many as could go , both of men and women , went to the gathering . \u201c I , too , \u201d said Crunnchu , \u201c will go like every one else to the assembly . \u201d \u201c Go not , \u201d said his wife , \u201c lest thou run into danger by speaking of us ; for our union will continue only if thou dost not speak of me in the assembly . \u201d \u201c I will not utter a word , \u201d said Crunnchu . The Ulstermen gathered to the festival , Crunnchu also going pith the rest . It was a brilliant festival , not alone in regard to the people , but as to horses and costumes also . There took place races and combats , tournaments , games , and processions . At the ninth hour the royal chariot was brought upon the ground , and the king 's horses carried the day in the contests . Then bards appeared to praise the king and the queen , the poets and the druids , his household , the people and the whole assembly . The people cried : \u201c Never before have two such horses been seen at the festival as these two horses of the king : in all Ireland there is not a swifter pair ! \u201d \u201c My wife runs quicker than these two horses , \u201d said Crunnchu . \u201c Seize the man , \u201d said the king , \u201c and hold him until his wife can be brought to the race - contest ! \u201d He was made fast , and messengers were despatched from the king to the woman . She bade the messengers welcome , and asked them what had brought them there . \u201c We have come for you that you may release your husband , kept prisoner by the king 's command , because he boasted that you were swifter of foot than the king 's horses . \u201d \u201c My husband has spoken unwisely , \u201d said she ; \u201c it was not fitting that he should say so . As for me , I am ill , and about to be delivered of a child . \u201d \u201c Alas for that , \u201d said the messengers , \u201c for thy husband will be put to death if thou dost not come . \u201d \u201c Then I must needs go , \u201d she said . Forthwith she went to the assembly . Every one crowded round to see her . \u201c it is not becoming , \u201d said she , \u201c that I should be gazed at in this condition . Wherefore am I brought hither ? \u201d \u201c To run in contest with the two horses of the king , \u201d shouted the multitude . \u201c Alas ! \u201d she cried , \u201c for I am close upon my hour . \u201d \u201c Unsheath your swords and hew yonder man to death , \u201d said the king . \u201c Help me , \u201d she cried to the bystanders , \u201c for a mother hath borne each one of you . Give me , O King , but a short delay , until I am delivered . \u201d \u201c It shall not be so , \u201d replied the king . \u201c Then shame upon you who have shown so little respect for me , \u201d she cried . \u201c Because you take no pity upon me , a heaviei . infamy will fall upon you . \u201d \u201c What is thy name ? \u201d asked the king . \u201c My name , \u201d said she , \u201c and the name of that which I shall bear , will for ever cleave to the place of this assembly . I am Macha , daughter of Sainreth mac Imbaith ( Strange son of Ocean ) . Bring up the horses beside me ! \u201d It was done , and she outran the horses and arrived first at the end of the course . Then she gave vent to a cry in her pain , but God helped her , and she bore twins , a son and a daughter , before the horses reached the goal . Therefore is the place called Emain Macha , the \" Twins of Macha . \" All who heard that cry were suddenly seized with weakness , so that they had no more strength than the woman in her pain . And she said , \u201c From this hour the ignominy that you have inflicted upon me will redound to the shame of each one of you . When a time of oppression falls upon you , each one of you who dwells in this province will be overcome with weakness , as the weakness of a woman in childbirth , and this will remain upon you for five days and four nights ; to the ninth generation it shall be so . \u201d Thus it was . It continued from the days of Crunnchu to the days of Fergus mac Donnell , or till the time of Forc , son of Dallan , son of Mainech , son of Lugaid . Three classes there were upon whom the debility had no power , namely , the children and the women of Ulster , and Cu Chulainn , because he was not descended from Ulster ; none , also , of those who were outside the province were afflicted by it . This is the cause of the Noinden Ulad , or the Debility of the Ulstermen . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Message\": [], \"Topic\": [], \"Speaker\": [\"Macha\"], \"Place\": [\"at the end of the course\"], \"Voice\": [\"a cry in her pain\"], \"Time\": [\"before the horses reached the goal\"]}"}

He served as CEO of the company until Prashanth Chandrasekar succeeded him in the role on October 1 , 2019 . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Announcing Stack Overflow 's New CEO , Prashanth Chandrasekar ! Last March , I shared that we were starting to look for a new CEO for Stack Overflow . We were looking for that rare combination of someone who could foster the community while accelerating the growth of our businesses , especially Teams , where we are starting to close many huge deals and becoming a hyper-growth enterprise software company very quickly . This is not something I 'm particularly good at , and I thought it was time to bring on more experienced leadership . The Board of Directors nominated a search committee and we went through almost 200 candidates . It speaks to how well respected a company Stack Overflow is that we found ourselves in the rare position of having plenty of highly qualified executives who were excited about the opportunity . Nevertheless , one of them really stood out , and we are pleased to let you know that we have selected Prashanth Chandrasekar as our next CEO . His first day will be October 1st . Prashanth was born in Bangalore , India , the city with the highest number of Stack Overflow users in the world , one of the global capitals for software developers writing the script for the future . He started out as a software engineer before moving over to management . He has a BS in Computer Engineering from the University of Maine , a Masters in Engineering Management from Cornell , and an MBA from Harvard . He worked at Capgemini as a management consultant and Barclays as an investment banker in their technology group before joining Rackspace in San Antonio , Texas . At Rackspace , Prashanth really proved his mettle , creating from scratch a completely new business unit inside the company , the Global Managed Public Clouds Business .

Noeline 's grandfather William , a publican by trade , was one of the 50 strong volunteers that came to Lough Mask from Monaghan \/ Cavan in 1880 in order to help with the harvesting of the crops . He died in 1904 at the age of 63 years . Gerry and Noeline had in their possession the historic silver commemorative medal , which was presented to William Moore in early 1881 by the Orange Order to the men who took part in the Lough Mask House Relief Expedition . It is believed to be the only remaining inscribed medal from this expedition left in Ireland , the National Museum in Dublin has one without inscription . The medal bore the following inscription : - Obverse side : the Imperial Crown and the words \" In honour of the Loyal and Brave Ulstermen \" ; - Reverse : \" The Boycott Expedition . Lough Mask 1880 . \" Space was left on this side for the name of each recipient . In this case the medal was inscribed with William Moore 's name . The Neale Heritage and Development Association are extremely grateful to Gerry and Noeline for their visit and a verbal commitment to donate the historic medal to the proposed community resource centre at the Neale has been given . This will be a wonderful asset to the new centre . The ribbon is orange with two green stripes which indicates that the medal is connected with agriculture . It was designed by a professional medalist named John Woodhouse Jnr and struck by West & Co of Belfast . Seventy one medals were struck and awarded to the officers of the expedition ( 3 ) the County Monaghan party ( 32 ) the county Cavan party ( 25 ) individuals from Dublin ( 7 ) Special awards ( 3 ) which went to the Earl of Enniskilling The Royal Irish Academy and The Belfast Newsletter . One was awarded to the British Museum for historical purposes . Charles Boycott was not awarded a medal . Boycott medals have not been common on the open market . The Story of the Expedition Charles Boycott found himself in real difficulties when the first ' boycott ' begun . It was as hard , then , to run a farm without labour as it would be difficult today to run one without tractors . Nonetheless the demands of the farm waited for no one . Charles had started harvesting . He had 300 sheep and perhaps fifty steers ( attending to sheep in those days was no sinecure ; foot - rot was common ) . What had been a well ordered private house and farm had been turned into a muddy , and disordered , public establishment . Everyone still living in Lough Mask House was required , suddenly , to adopt a new , and most unexpected , lifestyle . By the end of the first week in November a ' Boycott Relief Expedition ' from Ulster had been , more or less decided upon . Charles , it is believed , did his best to stop this from happening , he needed no more than about twelve men to finish his harvest ) . Tension began , slowly to mount ; plans to transfer additional soldiers to Ballinrobe were made ; troops began to patrol the roads leading to Charles house ; the telegraph between Ballinrobe and Dublin was kept , permanently , open , additional magistrates were drafted into the Ballinrobe area . On 9th November further military reinforcements , from Dublin and The Curragh proceeded west to Ballinrobe ; and , by the following day , about 900 soldiers ( from different arms of the services ) and a small ' army ' of war and newspaper correspondents had arrived , Ballinrobe was seething with excitement ! Could it , conceivably be true that an armed body of Ulstermen was on its way to help Charles ' get in his turnips ' ? On 10th November the ' Boycott Expedition ' was reported as being ready to leave Ulster . Whilst Charles had succeeded in ' saving ' a large part of his grain crop he still needed to complete his harvest . The rumour that he was about to play host to a number of Ulstermen filled him with justified - trepidation ; even the R.I.C , billeted on his land , were prevented from buying food in Ballinrobe . But , and despite his mounting difficulties , Charles remained defiant . On the same day , in Ulster , the fifty volunteers from counties Monaghan and Cavan showed themselves to be ' stout and respectable ' - and cheerful young men ( whatever anyone else might call them ! ) . they had been told that they were going to County Mayo to save the crops of a brave and courageous English gentleman . On 11th November the two separate county parties merged under the command of Mr Manning , Mr Goddard ( a solicitor ) and Captain Somerset Maxwell who was then aged seventy -seven . Whilst waiting on Athlone station the volunteers were issued with revolvers but told to conceal them The Dublin Daily Express donated food and supplies . The party travelled on to Claremorris by a scheduled train . At Claremorris station the volunteers found themselves facing a substantial reception party . This consisted of one Field Officer and twenty other ranks from the 1st Dragoons , 150 officers and men of the 76th Regiment , two troops of the l9th Hussars , Colone I Bruce and a number of Royal Irish Constables , several Resident Magistrates , an ambulance wagon under the command of Surgeon Major Reynolds and a large group of war and newspaper reporters . Not surprisingly the Freemen 's Journal remarked that they had never seen 'a sorrier or more wretched crew than the volunteers ' whilst the ' loyalist press ' described a group of ' fine young men ' making 'a brave show of indifference . ' From Claremorris to Ballinrobe At about 4.30 pm - it was November and darkness was fast coming on - the marching party set off on their fourteen - mile march to Ballinrobe . Heavy rain is said to have fallen ' continuously . ' For a reason now obscure the escort of 150 men of the 76th Regiment were relieved , at Hollymount , by a similar number from the 84th Regiment . Several delays occurred , it was not until nearly five hours had elapsed that the by now wet and weary volunteers reached Ballinrobe . On the following day ( 12th November ) the weather had improved . The military column smaller than on the previous day - reformed itself and marched on , for a further three miles , to Lough Mask House where it was received by Charles and Assheton Weekes , both of whom were armed . Not many people watched ; most of those who did were women . That evening Charles gave a dinner party for those army officers , volunteer officers and magistrates who intended to spend the night at or near , Lough Mask House . The volunteers make themselves as comfortable as circumstances allowed , everyone found a tent . The expeditions first night in Lough Mask House is believed to have been very wet . The process of turning Charles 's tidy paths and well - kept lawns into an appaling - quagmire had begun . On 12th November there were about 900 soldiers in and around Lough Mask House and Ballinrobe and about 7,000 in the west of Ireland . Charles continued , resolutely , to defy the Land League . The eyes of the world were , by now , focused upon events in Lough Mask House . On Saturday 13th November the task of ' saving Charles 's crops ' began - this meant the lifting of eight acres of turnips , seven acres of mangolds , two acres of potatoes and the threshing of twenty acres of already cut corn . The Royal Engineers ' scooped out ' a cooking trench upon which the volunteer cooks placed gigantic pots of potatoes . Three or four members of the party started on the threshing , using Charles 's ' modern ' - but still very small - hand - thresher ; the remainder , accompanied by their officers and escorted by police and a patrol of the l9th Hussars , marched out to Charles 's fields . That night the Monaghan men returned soaking wet and refused to sleep in their tents , but seemed happier when moved into a hayloft . A rumour reached the camp that it was to be attacked that evening ; sentries were doubled , a password given out and extra soldiers from the 84th moved up but nothing untoward happened . The Ulstermen had only a limited objective . When they had secured Charles 's crops , and threshed his corn , the only thing remaining to them was to return home . In the meanwhile the eyes and ears of the western world including American eyes and ears - remained glued upon Lough Mask and his exciting affairs . On the next day Father John O'Malley of The Neale began to react to the apparent success of the Ulstermen . He proposed that a delegation of Lough Mask House and farm employees , led by himself , should go north to meet Lord Erne . On 20th November Michael Davitt returned to Ireland from the U.S.A. - too late to take any part in the ' Boycott affair ' but not too late to emphasise to his many friends in Ireland the depth of American support for Ireland . By about the same date it seemed unlikely that any surprising incident would upset the steady flow of events round Lough Mask House . The Ulstermen were working well . Such of Charles 's crops as could be sold were fetching good prices . Somerset Maxwell had abandoned the boathouse and was staying with Lord and Lady Ardilaun near Cong . A professional photographer named Wynne had taken some excellent photographs of the ' camp ' and its occupants . Auld Lang Syne By Friday 26th November the Ulster Volunteers had finished their work . That night everyone was kept awake by another tremendous storm which , finally , completed the ruin of Charles 's well - trampled park and his lawns and paths . On the following day ( 27th November ) conditions were better and everyone set about striking camp with a will . At about 2 pm the volunteers accompanied by their officers some soldiers , the press and several newspaper artists assembled outside Charles 's front door . Somerset Maxwell read out a courteous letter from Charles in which he thanked everyone for their help and expressed the sadness he felt at being obliged ' to quit , with my wife , a happy home where we had hoped to have spent the remainder of our days . ' A great cheer went up when Charles walked down his front door steps and shook hands with everyone . A Regimentals cook borrowed a scabbard and beat the time whilst the assembled company sang ' Auld Lang Syne ' and ' For They are Jolly Good Fellows ' . Not many local people watched the departure to Ballinrobe of ' the queerest menagerie that ever came to Connaught ' , but Father O'Malley was one . He found himself entangled with an old lady . ' Did I not warn you ' he said , ' to let the British Army alone ? How dare you come to intimidate those two thousand heroes after their glorious campaign ? I 'll make an example of you . Be off ! ' It was still dark when the volunteers and soldiers marched away from Ballinrobe to catch their trains . Charles and Annie accompanied by a dog , a parrot and a few suitcases - left Lough Mask House early on the same day in an ambulance wagon ( drawn , it is believed by four grey mules ) and escorted by a troop of the 19th Hussars . As Charles caught up , and passed through , the Ulster Volunteers he took off his hat to them ; they had done their duty . Atter Charles left Lough Mask House at the end of November 1880 ' boycotting ' became both widespread , and notorious , in Ireland . ' Boycotting ' To ' boycott ' was legal in as much as it could not <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Agent\": [\"Charles Boycott\"], \"Place\": [\"Lough Mask House\"], \"Time\": [\"in November\"], \"Issue\": [\"to finish his harvest\"]}"}

Open CASCADE technology was <event> contacted <\/event> by Debian team in 2009 , and 2012 got a reply that Open CASCADE technology was considering dual - licensing OCCT ( the library ) , however they postponed that move . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> LibreDWG drama : the end or the new beginning ? There 's a can of worms we opened this year : the unfortunate situation with support for DWG files in free CAD software via LibreDWG . We feel , by now it ought to be closed . We have the final answer from FSF . In January this year LGW picked a lead about perspectives of LibreDWG and support for DWG in software like LibreCAD , FreeCAD , Open Asset Import Library , and Blender . The key question was : why does n't any of the end -user applications use the existing code in LibreDWG to gain support for DWG files ? As it turned out , it was about incompatibility between LibreDWG , which is GPLv3 + , and some of the 3rd party projects which had strictly GPLv2 licensed code or linked to one . We contacted all involved parties \u2014 developers of LibreDWG , maintainers of all aforementioned 3rd party end -user software , and a license compatibility engineer at FSF . Eventually , as nothing was moving forward , in April one of LibreDWG developers contacted Richard Stallman personally ( and CCed several people including me ) . It took quite a bit of persuasion ( 3 months ) to get him to provide a clear and concise statement , and that statement is : We are not going to change the license . So , what does it mean ? Is it the end of DWG support in free software ? Is LibreDWG actually alive ? And what took it LGW so long to publish an update to the story ? Let 's start from the very beginning . The core of the issue Essentially , it 's about incompatibility between GPLv2 - only and GPLv3 + code . LibreDWG is licensed under GPLv3 + , and all copyright belongs to Free Software Foundation . The actual developers do n't have a say in all legal matters . The FAQ on GPL clearly states : Is GPLv3 compatible with GPLv2 ? No . Some of the requirements in GPLv3 , such as the requirement to provide Installation Information , do not exist in GPLv2 . As a result , the licenses are not compatible : if you tried to combine code released under both these licenses , you would violate section 6 of GPLv2 . However , if code is released under GPL \u201c version 2 or later , \u201d that is compatible with GPLv3 because GPLv3 is one of the options it permits . For FreeCAD the problem was both the Coin3D library and the Open CASCADE library . The first used to be GPLv2 - only and was relicensed to GPL - compatible BSD 3 - clause in December 2011 . The Open CASCADE project , however , currently uses its own Open CASCADE Technology Public License that is n't GPL - compatible . They were contacted about that by Debian team in 2009 . In late 2011 they publicly stated that they were considering dual - licensing OCCT ( the library ) , however in February 2012 they announced they were postponing that move . According to Andrey Betenev , as of December 2012 the decision is still up to the head company that controls Open CASCADE assets . For LibreCAD the legal issue is about the GPLv2 - only code inherited from Ribbonsoft who created the original QCad Community Edition product . The company declined the requests to relicense the code and even requested immediate removal of additional content such as documentation and fonts from LibreCAD . So before FSF issued a final statement ( not a public one , too ) on the matter , we were dealing with a situation where LibreDWG could become usable for end -user software only at the risk of potential legal issues . Having had seen that developers of free CAD software could n't make use of LibreDWG , the library developers eventually lost the motivation to work on the project and ceased their involvement . Which did n't make the situation any better . What 's going on now In terms of DWG support in free software nothing is really going on . GRASS is still the only project knowingly using the LibreDWG library . FreeCAD team is about to release v 0.13 , LibreCAD team is working on upcoming v2.0 , Open Asset Import Library and Blender are compatible , but have no volunteers to work on the support for DWG files . Meanwhile earlier this year Open Design Alliance released v 5.2 of their DWG specification that finally makes a stab at decrypting binary ACIS data \u2014 the most important part of DWG for FreeCAD . The development of LibreDWG is effectively on hold . Latest changes to master branch were committed in January 2011 , and latest changes to r2007 branch were committed in February 2012 . What 's next How can we solve this ? Let 's be realistic : we probably ca n't . You ca n't force Open CASCADE managers to okay the switch of the license to LGPL : they will do it only when they feel comfortable about it and have the green lights from lawyers . And knowing the track record of Ribbonsoft , chances that you can get them to relicense their code from the QCad Community Edition are rather zero-ish . If it 's not relicensing , then surely there could be a technical workaround ? Like a plug - in ? Well , not quite . For instance , according to LibreCAD team , right now there are just two ways for LibreDWG to be legally used in LibreCAD via the plug - in interface : - Rewriting all LibreCAD classes that are currently GPLv2 -only . - Creating tons of proxy objects to work around license incompatibility . Given the current development status of LibreCAD , none of the two ways seem realistic , and in terms of longterm strategy planning the second approach is , frankly , unthinkable . Edit : accrording to one of LibreDWG developers the second scenario is n't legal anyway . Finally , once you break through the legal matters , you have to deal with the fact that LibreDWG is currently unmaintained and even has n't had a single tarball release ever . There does n't seem to be any development going on , the code for R2007 file format is still in a branch , and no work on R2010 file format has even ( knowingly ) started . But wait , is n't LibreDWG one of the high priority projects by Free Software Foundation ? Unfortunately , so far hopes for FSF to take the lead have proven to be false . Richard Stallman was n't even aware of the problems one of their \u201c high priority \u201d projects had been facing for a long time . And it does n't look like he did anything about it since he learned about it : no awareness campaign , no direct contacting of involved parties that we know about . Since I was drawn into a private discussion with Richard about LibreDWG anyway , I specifically asked him , whether FSF was planning to take any actions to ensure that the work on LibreDWG was n't left unused by free end -user software . That was in June 2012 . After 6 months ( I can be very patient , when I have to ) and several reminders Richard still has n't provided any reply whatsoever . Apparently , the question does n't deserve an answer . You are at liberty to draw your conclusions from that . I have my own reservations . As you can see , solving this issue for both FreeCAD and LibreCAD is going to need a well orchestrated campaign . It 's going to involve a smart strategy . And it 's going to take years to get to the stage where you have production - quality input and output of DWG files . So we are talking about a bottomless supply of patience coupled with passion and some serious management skills . I 'm confident : there is a CAD version of Barney Stinson walking around who can claim that the challenge is accepted . Maybe it 's you ? <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Address\": [], \"Communication\": [], \"Place\": [], \"Topic\": [\"incompatibility between GPLv2 - only and GPLv3 + code\"], \"Addressee\": [\"The Open CASCADE project\"], \"Communicator\": [\"by Debian team\"], \"Time\": [\"in 2009\"]}"}

Sanders and Hawkins were the first people in Italy to use the process of trap-neuter-return ( TNR ) to <event> control <\/event> cat populations . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Just a few decades ago , Venice was full of furry cats . They had their own city , one that included roofs of buildings and secret walled gardens . You 'd smell the pee they marked their territories with in the back alleys . But in the space of those thirty years , the street cats of Venice have all but vanished . What 's behind this mysterious disappearance ? To get to the bottom of this story , let 's start at the beginning . For centuries , Venetians lived side - by- side with cats . They were brought in by traders from the Middle East and cherished by the local population for their usefulness in keeping away rats , in houses as well as on merchant ships . Special breeds were introduced in the 13th century that were especially adept hunters . They were even credited for helping to save the city from the plague of 1348 by keeping disease carrying rats at bay . Famous cats were even a part of Venetian history . The cat of Doge Francesco Morosini was brought everywhere with the naval commander , including into war . Nini , a white cat who lived at the Caffe dei Frari was an international celebrity and he even had a wake held in his honor when he died in 1894 . The main character in our tale will be a British lady who arrived in Venice in 1965 , at a time when many of the cats of the city were sick and in need of organized care . Her name was Helena Sanders . You can see her in this delightful TV interview , explaining how she came to be an advocate for Venetian street cats and how surprised she was at the resistance that she was met with . She sounds like a sweet grandmother , but in fact she was promoting quite a progressive program . Sanders was among the first in Italy to practice TNR , or trap- neuter-return . In the 1950s , animal welfare activists in the U.K began to trap alley cats in order to sterilize and neuter them before returning them to their outdoor homes . This was not only a way to eradicate diseases , but it also allowed them to control the population , so that unwanted colonies could be eliminated over time . This practice , however , did not find favor with local people . The Venetian lawyer interviewed in the video , Umberto Corado , argues simply that the cats serve a purpose in the city \u2013 their historic purpose of keeping the rats away and that their numbers were quite normal . In pre-modern times , animals were kept primarily for their use value . Dogs were for guarding , cats for catching mice and so on . Just 70 years ago , it was unheard of to have a cat live entirely indoors . It just was n't possible until the mid-20th century . The development of refrigeration and canned cat food meant that cats did n't have to hunt . The marketing of cat litter began in the 1960s , so they would n't need to go out for the bathroom . The practice of neutering became available in the 30s and spaying in the 50s , so that cats would n't wander outside searching for mates . It 's important to understand the TNR movement as a part of a shift in the cultural mindset in general . The cat and the dog were entering the bourgeois family circle in these decades as the family pet . Just as the place they entered was sanitized and sterilized , so they themselves needed to become clean and sterile . As John Berger writes in his essay on animals , \u201c the pet is \u2026 sexually isolated , deprived of almost all other animal contact , and fed with artificial foods \u2026 they are creatures of their owner 's way of life . \u201d The street cat , which found its home within the community , was out . The domestic cat of the individual home was in . The campaign taken up by Sanders ' association , Dingo , followed this sea change . The news clip states that Sanders encountered a population of some 38,000 cats . Her organization , Dingo , claims it stabilized a population of 12,000 cats that roamed the streets of Venice , bringing the numbers down to 2,000 over time with support from the city government . Nowadays , street cats are significantly fewer than a few decades ago . Though you 'll still find cats lounging about at the bookstore Acqua Alta and in the gardens of the hospital , they are by no means the regular feature of Venetian life they once were . In this way , they have become a metaphor for the Venetians themselves . Last year , an article in La Nuova Venezia followed a meeting of a group called Awakening , made up of photo-journalists , environmental groups and cat lovers . Representative Marco Secchi says , \u201c the cats disappeared like Venetians are disappearing . \u201d They claim that the enormous influx of tourists that floods the city every year has made it difficult for cats to live in the streets and squares that were their homes . While the statement is uncorroborated , it 's not hard to see why this feels poignantly true . This is the story of the human residents of Venice , who are being pushed out en masse by the booming industry of mass tourism , their houses converted into profitable rentals and hotels . In just 30 years , the city has lost half of its residents , going from 120,000 to about about 55,000 currently . Meanwhile , the number of visitors has skyrocketed up to 20 million annually , half of which do n't stay even one night . Along with these demographic shifts have come social and cultural changes . Local bakeries , fish markets and butchers are slowly encroached upon by easy and quick supermarket culture . Artisan boutiques are closing and dime - a-dozen souvenir shops are popping up . Even parts of Venice that were unsafe , like Giudecca and Castello , are now prime real estate for fancy restaurants and luxury hotels . The alley cats who roamed free and owned the city 's back streets represent a kind of wildness and autonomy that Venetians have lost .

What is rarely understood is that there are variations in stir-frying technique . Broadly classified the variations are 1 ) plain stir-fry ( \u6e05\u7092 or QingChao ) , 2 ) moist stir-fry ( \u6ed1\u7092 or HuaChao ) and 3 ) dry wok stir-fry ( \u7178\u7092 or BianChao ) . In this third part of Stir-fry Fortnight series post let me show you how simple it is to make plain vegetable stir-fry . Among these different variations American cooks understand plain stir-fry the least . I rarely see mention of plain stir- fry vegetables as a dish in a Chinese American meal . But a meal in China almost always includes one . It is often served to balance meat and other protein dishes . I for one crave for a vegetable stir-fry every meal , even when I 'm having steak and potato . ( Thank god for creamed spinach ! ) Perhaps the reason that Americans are not familiar with this technique is because Chinese restaurants rarely list them in menus . A Chinese patron would normally just ask the waiter or waitress what kind of green vegetables are in season and available in the kitchen , then simply order one for plain stir-fry . Plain stir-fry is usually made of one single vegetable ingredient . When cooked in the classic plain stir-fry manner it is simply dropped into very hot oil , seasoned with salt and stirred until cooked . No thickener , no soy sauce , plain and simple . Sliced garlic is often added , and is then known as garlic stir-fry ( \u849c\u7092 or SuanChao ) . Additionally , other condiments such as fermented black beans ( \u8c46\u8c49 ) , shrimp paste ( \u8766\u91ac ) and fermented tofu ( \u8150\u4e73 ) can also be added to enhance flavor . A few tips are in order to help you with plain stir-fry . When cooking leafy vegetable it is almost always sufficient to just let them cook in their own moisture , without covering the wok . Keep stirring while cooking to prevent the greens from burning . However when cooking vegetables that contain less moisture such as legumes or gourds , you can add a few splashes of water during cooking and cover the wok with a lid . Repeat this a few times and stir the vegetable in between until cooked . To show you the plain stir-fry technique I selected a recipe for Garlic Stir-fry Pea Shoots ( \u849c\u7092\u8c46\u82d7 ) . Pea shoots are the tender tendrils of pea vines . They are most commonly harvested from snow pea vines . The tender shoots have a slightly spicy sweet taste and are full of Vitamin C and Potassium . After you 've read this post go out and buy any leafy green vegetable such as spinach , bok choy or watercress , and substitute the greens in this recipe . Garlic Stir-fry Pea Shoots ( \u849c\u7092\u8c46\u82d7 ) Ingredients - 12 ounces pea shoots - 2 cloves garlic sliced thinly - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil - 1\/2 teaspoon salt Instructions - When buying pea shoots be sure to select young tender leaves . To prepare for stir-frying snap the stems into bite size length . Rinse in cold water thoroughly and drain well . Slice garlic thinly and set aside . - Heat the vegetable oil in a wok over high heat . Drop the garlic slices into the wok just as the oil begins to smoke . Stir the garlic around for about 30 seconds and add all the pea shoots into the wok . The water on the pea shoots from rinsing should be sufficient to keep the wok moist as the vegetable cooks . Add salt and stir-fry for about one more minute . The vegetable is ready when the leaves are just wilted . Plate and serve . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Place\": [\"China\"], \"Cook\": [\"me\"], \"Produced_food\": [\"plain vegetable stir-fry\"]}"}

These days it 'd be hard to make a long - running series based on a schoolmaster who took pleasure in thwacking his charges and swindling everyone . Fortunately , in olden days sense prevailed . Whack - O! featured the wonderful Jimmy Edwards as Professor James Edwards . Prof Edwards is one of the great characters of sitcom , an unapologetic , scheming drunk , who constantly runs rings around his fellow masters and thinks nothing of cheating and manipulating charges and colleagues alike . Teachers v Pupils is standard fare throughout film and TV , but usually it 's like St Trinians - we 're on the side of the kids . Whack - O! brilliantly realised that adults wanted to see a teacher prevail , particularly when the teacher in question was a charming sociopath . Watching the series now is a little painful in one respect - we 're too sensitive to find canings amusing - but it 's right on the money in other ways , mainly because finding over privileged kids vile has n't gone out of fashion . Frank Muir and Denis Norden between them brought 45 episodes of Whack - O! into being , and the series ran successfully from 1956 - 1960 . The only problem might have been that they thought they were making a monster , whereas in fact they were making a monster so grotesque you could n't help loving him . Despite the fact that times changed for the world , Whack - O! continued into the film Bottoms Up , and was relaunched in 1971 in colour . A series out of its time , it never recaptured its former glory , and whilst sketches such as the fantastic Rowan Atkinson \/ Richard Curtis outing ' Fatal Beatings ' pushed the idea into even more extreme directions , whole series that tried to make light of the odd pupil-beating have n't been able to catch the wave in a more sensitive and correct time .

Materials & Pre-Demo Preparations : 3 g dextrose 5 g sodium hydroxide pellets 5 - 10 ml indigo carmine indicator solution , ( 1 % solution - 1 g per 100 ml water ) 250 ml distilled water 500 ml round - bottom flask stopper stirring rod Before the demonstration , dissolve 3 g of dextrose and 5 g of sodium hydroxide in 250 ml distilled water . After adding the indigo carmine indicator , the solution needs to sit for at least 10 minutes before you can begin the demonstration . Directions : In a beaker containing 250 ml of distilled water , add 3 g of dextrose and stir until it dissolves . Next , add 5 g of sodium hydroxide pellets into the same beaker , and use a stirring rod to break apart the pellets so that they will dissolve quickly . Once this is done , pour the contents of the beaker into the glass flask , and add between 5 - 10 ml of the indigo carmine indicator . Enough should be added to the solution so that it turns a yellow color . Put the stopper in the flask , and let it sit for ten minutes . After ten minutes , the solution should be ready for the demonstration . Shake the flask once or twice , and it should turn a red color . Shake once or twice again , and it should turn green . Then , if it sits , it should turn back to the yellow color . Introduction & Commentary : Who knows how traffic lights work ? What are the three colors that you see on a traffic light ? Well , I 'm going to make a traffic light on my own in this bottle , and I 'm not even going to add any new chemicals like everyone else has been doing . Explanation : The indigo carmine indicator changes color as a result of the changing levels of oxygen in the solution . The solution is originally yellow in color , but when the flask is shaken , oxygen dissolves into the solution , therefore oxidizing the indicator , and changing the color to red . When the flask is shaken again , the levels of oxygen increase more , and will oxidize the indicator further , causing it to turn green . When the solution is left alone , however , the oxygen concentration drops due to a reaction with the dextrose , so the solution will turn back to its original yellow color . Safety Precautions : Since sodium hydroxide is a corrosive chemical , use caution when shaking the flask . Make sure the stopper is on tight , and put your hand on top of it when shaking . Waste Disposal : Dispose of the contents of the flask in the sink . Reference : Flinn Scientific , Inc. , CHEMFAX , Pub .

Ties between India and China have long been hostage to mutual suspicion and great - power rivalry , but the joint training is the result of a new approach to Afghanistan that was agreed upon by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their informal summit in Wuhan , China in April 2018 . The change in Indian - Chinese bilateral relations on Afghanistan from a zero-sum dynamic to outcome-driven cooperation is likely to go a long way in helping to secure peace in the country by making it impossible for Pakistan to oppose Indo - Chinese projects to build up the capacity of the Afghan state . If India and China continue to successfully implement joint projects , they should be able to convince other stakeholders , such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and NATO , to help stabilize Afghanistan as well . Security is a natural focus for the two countries , as the situation in Afghanistan continues to deteriorate . According to the latest report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction to the U.S. Congress , the Afghan government controls just over half of the country \u2013 \u2013 55.5 percent of districts \u2013\u2013down from 72.5 percent three years earlier . In the face of a sustained Taliban insurgency , both New Delhi and Beijing are giving indications of pragmatic thinking on how to navigate their respective interests by working in coordination . There is a realization in both countries that growing instability in Afghanistan can have a potentially negative spillover effect for the region . Moreover , there is significant overlap in Chinese and Indian interests as well . Instability in Afghanistan has provided an enabling environment for terrorist networks such as al - Qaeda , ISIS - Khorasan , East Turkestan Islamic Movement ( ETIM ) , Lashkar -e- Taiba , the Haqqani Network , and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan ( IMU ) to launch attacks across the region . The chaos has allowed human , drug , and weapons smuggling to thrive too . China has additional security concerns related to Islamic militancy among the Uighur population in its far-western province of Xinjiang . Uighur militants have found shelter beyond China 's borders in the past , and in recent years , aided by ISIS , Uighur militancy has re-emerged in Afghanistan , where the Islamic State of Khorasan Province ( ISKP ) has called for jihad against China , vowing to \u201c shed blood like rivers . \u201d This has led China to tighten its ties with Kabul and provide counterterrorism assistance , including training and equipment , to the Afghan government . There is speculation that Beijing is in talks with Kabul over the construction of a military base in the mountainous Wakhan Corridor ( which links Xinjiang and Afghanistan ) , where joint patrols of Chinese and Afghan troops have been reported . As it looks to increase its footprint in Afghanistan , China has also turned to its long - standing military ally and trading partner , Pakistan . The \u201c all - weather \u201d friendship between China and Pakistan and the deep linkages between Pakistan 's security establishment and the Afghan Taliban have obliged Beijing to accommodate the Taliban . Beijing hopes that this will convince the group to cut its ties with ETIM and the IMU , which will help China contain their presence in Afghanistan . In the past year , China has also directly engaged with the Afghan Taliban as part of its back - channel diplomacy , during which Pakistan is said to have acted as a broker for the Taliban . This willingness to talk directly to the Taliban rather than just mediate in Afghan - led negotiations shows China 's seriousness in getting involved in Afghan politics . China 's Belt and Road initiative ( BRI ) is also unlikely to achieve its goals if there is constant conflict in Afghanistan , with blowback effects in Pakistan . In fact , Maulana Samiul Haq , the \u201c Father of the Taliban \u201d who was recently assassinated in his Rawalpindi home , had asked China to act as an arbitrator in Afghan peace negotiations . It would not be entirely incorrect to argue that the road to peace in Afghanistan runs through Rawalpindi in terms of its ability to put pressure on the Afghan Taliban to join the peace process , and no country other than China has real leverage over Pakistan 's security establishment . It was pressure from Beijing that forced the Pakistani military to launch a decisive operation in June 2014 in North Waziristan against the Taliban Movement of Pakistan , who were said to be hosting ETIM . At the same time , China is keen to involve India\u2013\u2013a country that has a broadly positive image among Afghans\u2013\u2013in its drive to secure its interests and influence in Afghanistan . For its part , by strengthening Afghanistan , India seeks to advance its own national security objectives \u2013 \u2013eliminating a critical safe haven for terrorists who have attacked India , and gaining access to Central Asian trade and energy resources . Islamabad 's exaggerated fears that New Delhi wants to trap Pakistan militarily through the Kabul government have led it to oppose Indian involvement in Afghanistan . Pakistan 's military establishment frequently levels allegations that an Indo - Afghan nexus is stoking separatist movements in Pakistan , and there have been many instances of kidnappings and attacks on Indians in Afghanistan aimed at frightening the Indian government into leaving the country . Despite Pakistan 's objections , Indo - Afghan ties remain robust , as reflected by the activation of the air corridor and the trilateral agreement with Iran over the Chabahar Port . Supporting a more proactive regional role for New Delhi\u2013\u2013which would contribute to Afghanistan 's security , stability , and economic development \u2013\u2013 should be in Beijing 's long - term interest . Joint capacity building and development - oriented projects with China in Afghanistan would be beneficial for India both economically and strategically . Besides protecting Indian nationals working in Afghanistan , such projects might also provide security from terrorist attacks backed by Pakistan 's security establishment . While Chinese - Indian cooperation on measures like joint diplomatic training is welcome , there remains a fundamental difference on how to resolve the Afghan problem . India would like China to play a more positive role in facilitating direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban\u2013 \u2013 the only path to peace and stability in the region . However , while Beijing has leverage with Pakistan 's security establishment , its close relationship with Islamabad has also been a real impediment to forcing it to deliver tangible results in a negotiated political settlement in Afghanistan . For now , the belief that China 's increasing involvement in Afghanistan might eventually motivate Beijing to put pressure on Pakistan to cut its ties with terrorist groups has yet to be translated into reality . Ultimately , if Chinese - Indian cooperation in Afghanistan is to prove successful , the two countries will need to find common ground on the issue of terrorism .

John Bercow ( Buckingham ) ( Con ) : I am proud to rise to champion the cause of the Nuffield speech and language unit , which is based in Ealing . It is a centre of excellence that now faces the threat of closure . It is right that the House and those interested in the subject should understand the background . The Nuffield speech and language unit is a part of the Royal National Throat , Nose and Ear hospital , which in turn is part of the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust . Since 1971 , the unit has provided specialist intensive therapy and teaching to children aged between four and seven with the most severe speech and language disorders . No provision of comparable quality for such children does or can exist in mainstream education . It is important to understand that children typically attend the unit for an average of two years . The severity of their impairments means that they are not able to participate in , or be integrated into , mainstream education . Quite apart from its teaching and therapy work , the unit has established itself intellectually and professionally as the repository of excellence in research and good practice , and the Nuffield dyspraxia programme is used in countries all over the world . The unit is small , catering for between 12 and 14 children . I have described the teaching and therapy that it provides , and the significance of its globally imitated dyspraxia programme . In addition , the unit is inextricably bound up with the Nuffield hearing and speech centre , which receives some 40 requests each week \u201a \u00c4\u00eefrom parents and professionals , by telephone , e-mail and post \u201a \u00c4\u00eeseeking advice on speech therapy . That is the background to the unit 's significance . It is exemplary and deservedly celebrated , but is now facing the threat of closure . For the best part of five successive years , the unit has been either full or over-subscribed . As a result , it had become a net financial contributor to its parent trust . This year , however , it is suffering a lack of referrals for 2006 - 07 and so is falling into deficit for the first time . Two factors explain the lack of referrals . First , the local education authority is resistant to the issuing of statements , and to agreeing to and providing finance for out - of - area placements . Secondly , there is a widespread and \u201a \u00c4\u00eedare I say it ? \u201a \u00c4\u00eealmost pervasive ignorance of the unit 's existence . I attribute that ignorance to the fact that the Royal Free Hampstead trust has devoted a degree of energy to marketing the trust that is somewhere between minimal and nil . I emphasise to the Minister that , on the strength of that one - year deficit , the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust is proposing to close this distinguished and celebrated unit . Mr. Philip Hollobone ( Kettering ) ( Con ) : I congratulate my hon . Friend on securing this debate . I received a telephone call today from a constituent , Dr. Deirdre Lucas , a distinguished audiology consultant who has nothing but praise for the unit 's special and unique work . She expressed in the strongest terms her fear that that centre of excellence and expertise could be lost for ever . It is without equal and , if we are not careful , we are going to lose a very precious resource . John Bercow : I am grateful to my hon . Friend , who makes his point eloquently and pithily . In preparing for the debate , I became aware of Dr. Deirdre Lucas , but it is a pretty safe bet that she will not be aware of me . I know of her authority and expertise in the field . She is one of a number of people who are determined to fight the good fight to preserve the unit because she has professional knowledge of its indispensability . My hon . Friend wisely used the word \u201c unique \u201d , which leads me to the arguments against closure of the unit . The facility is unique . That word may be hackneyed ; it is overused and frequently used inappropriately but it could scarcely be more appositely deployed than in respect of the unit . There is no other facility of its kind either in London or anywhere else in the country , so it is unique and it is also irreplaceable . However , the Minister does not need to take that from me . He can take it from the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust 's consultation document , which puts the point clearly , stating helpfully that Significantly , it adds that if the unit ceases to exist , the future potential of the children whom it serves will be severely damaged . I could not put it more effectively than that . We are describing a vital national resource , which on my reckoning at least 16 local education authorities have used over the years . We cannot afford lightly , if at all , to dispense with existing centres of excellence . We should be proud of them . We should be defending them and building on them , championing and supporting them , and if they are under threat it is the responsibility of all political parties , including pre-eminently the governing party , to get involved : to take a stance , to lend a hand and not to back off \u201a \u00c4\u00eea point to which I will , in due course , return . Mr. Peter Bone ( Wellingborough ) ( Con ) : I congratulate my hon . Friend on securing this important debate . Does he agree that one of the problems is that to a certain extent the unit is seen as a Cinderella part of the national health and the education services ? I have personal experience of the problem . My five -year - old son had a minor speech problem that was difficult to have attended to in the state system , so to hear that a unit with such national excellence is to close is extremely worrying . John Bercow : I entirely agree . My hon . Friend reinforces the argument and the impression , which I am glad to say is correct and growing , that there is strong support for the unit . We are entitled to look at the long - term outcomes of the Nuffield unit 's work \u201a \u00c4\u00eefor example , over the period between 1998 and 2003 . I re-emphasise that we are talking about help for severely disadvantaged children . After two years at the unit , 41 per cent . of children are able to go on to mainstream education ; 7 per cent . go on to local language units attached to mainstream schools ; 38 per cent . go to the Meath school , a specialist school that caters specifically for children with severe speech and language disorders ; and 13 per cent . go to other specialist schools . Early intervention is of the essence . I underline that point . We have to ensure that children in special and intense need are assisted at an early stage . If we do that , help , treatment , therapy and teaching can be highly effective . What is more , that can result in cost savings in the medium to long term . On the other hand , if we intervene very late , there are grave risks , such as emotional and psychological damage , lower educational attainment , a persistent communication handicap and poorer employment prospects . For all those reasons , it is vital that children get a chance without the procrastination , delay and politicking that prevent them from getting the help that they need . We cannot simply intervene later and rescue the situation . Serious , grave and potentially irrevocable damage can be done to the opportunities and life chances of children who are so delayed or neglected . I want to say something about the support that exists for the unit . My hon . Friends the Members for Kettering ( Mr. Hollobone ) and for Wellingborough ( Mr. Bone ) have already referred to that , but let it be underlined . A plethora of testimonials is now emerging in support of the unit . I call in aid first of all Pamela Williams , who is the chief speech therapist at the Nuffield speech and language unit and also chair of the Dyspraxia Foundation . Her words should carry weight and be listened to with respect by all hon . Members . She has said : Hers is not the only voice . Let us listen to the verdict of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists , which has publicly stated and communicated to me its belief that the demise of the unit would cause an \u201c erosion of expertise \u201d and a \u201c loss of capacity \u201d , with the result that patients would be left \u201c unsupported \u201d . Let us hear , too , the verdict of Janet Farrugia , a distinguished speech and language therapist of 25 years ' experience . She says : Significantly and ominously , she goes on to add that children who go elsewhere for their treatment or education make \u201c significantly slower \u201d progress . From the range of parents , I would like to cite in particular Dr. Tony Canas , who has founded the Friends of the Nuffield Speech and Language Unit . He is a truly remarkable man who is fighting as David against Goliath in the battle . He has set up a website and devoted an enormous amount of time and his considerable intellectual prowess to try to make arguments in support of the unit . He and his wife Angela have a son , Vincente , at the unit . They had to go through an enormous , debilitating , protracted , expensive and potentially soul-destroying battle to get their son into the unit , which they did , and he has now been there for the best part of an academic year . Tony Canas says : That is the considered judgment of a range of people who know of the unit , who can see its benefit , who are alarmed at the threat to its existence and who are determined to protect it . Dr. Julian Lewis ( New Forest , East ) ( Con ) : My hon . Friend is making such an overwhelming case that I will ask him briefly to do something slightly unusual in a debate of this sort . Will he put himself in the shoes of the people who are trying to close the unit and say what possible basis they could adduce for its closure in the face of such an overwhelming endorsement of it ? It is hard to envisage any such basis from the testimonials that he has eloquently read to the House . John Bercow : I am very grateful to my hon . Friend , who will have been a friend of mine for 23 years this October . We have often said that we have only one brain and we have thought it prudent over the years , in the course of our political careers , to share it between us . We each have an uncanny tendency to anticipate the thoughts and prospective pronouncements of the other , but I have to say , in all candour , that if he thinks that I am able to penetrate the inner recesses of the sort of extraordinarily contorted minds that could seriously contemplate a decision <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Medication\": [], \"Body_part\": [], \"Time\": [], \"Place\": [\"in Ealing\"], \"Healer\": [\"The Nuffield speech and language unit\"], \"Treatment\": [\"specialist intensive\"], \"Patient\": [\"to children aged between four and seven\"], \"Affliction\": [\"with the most severe speech and language disorders\"]}"}

Those were the words of Austin Dexter , a \u201c swamp rat \u201d who grew up in the Kankakee marsh in the mid- to late - 1800s . He was interviewed in the early 1920s by pioneer Kankakee historian and storyteller Burt Burroughs . The murder of the Grand Kankakee Marsh actually was a slow death spanning more than a half - century . The crime was committed by a state government and groups of individuals eager to profit from reclaiming a \u201c dismal wasteland \u201d and converting it into farm fields that would yield a bountiful harvest . The earliest efforts at draining the almost one- million - acre wetland were made in the mid-1850s , when landowners hand - dug channels to direct water into the Kankakee River . Most of the early ditching efforts were made at the eastern end of the marsh , which stretched along both sides of the river from South Bend , Ind. , to Momence . Frontier settlers saw the marsh as a dismal , unproductive wasteland ; draining it to allow planting of crops was considered a benefit . One author wrote approvingly about an early landowner who \u201c took the unproductive acres of the swamps , drained them , and brought them into cultivation . \u201d Even the U.S. government approved ; the federal Swamp Act of 1850 turned over wetlands to state governments , which could sell the land and use the proceeds for drainage projects . In the 1870s and 1880s , drainage efforts were ramped up with the introduction of steam-driven dredges . The large machines were far faster and more productive than the hand - digging and oxen - drawn - plow methods used previously . They produced wider , deeper ditches , piling up the excavated material to form levees or road bases along the sides . One of the earliest waterways dug by a steam dredge was the Singleton Ditch , begun in 1873 . In Lake County , Ind. , it runs parallel to and about one mile to the north of the river , crosses the state line , and empties into the Kankakee just east of Momence . During the late 1800s , literally hundreds of miles of similar ditches were dug through the wetlands on either side of the river . \u201c Reclaimed \u201d swampland soon was producing bumper crops of cereal grains and vegetables , such as onions and sugar beets . While small farmsteads were common , most of the Grand Marsh was in the hands of large landowners , such as Chicago meat-packer Nelson Morris . He owned more than 25,000 acres , where he raised large herds of cattle brought to Indiana from Texas . A related drainage project was Beaver Lake , located on the southwestern edge of the marsh , north of the town of Morocco . The earliest effort to drain the 16,000 - acre lake was made by the Indiana state government in 1853 . A ditch several miles in length was dug to connect the lake with the Kankakee River , but the results were disappointing : the lake 's shoreline receded by only about 100 yards . During the next 20 years , further ditching efforts drained away most of the lake , leaving only a narrow body of water about two miles long and 800 feet wide . Kankakeean Lemuel Milk owned 10,000 acres of former lake bottom ; his nephew , H.H. Cooley , owned about 4,000 more , including the remaining body of water . On Aug. 29 , 1874 , Milk and Cooley opened a deepened ditch , draining away the last vestiges of Beaver Lake . The Grand Kankakee Marsh itself , however , still resisted drainage efforts . Despite the miles of ditches that had turned thousands of acres into farmland , vast areas adjoining the river still were underwater . The culprit was a ledge of limestone , extending a mile upstream from Momence . The ledge acted as a natural dam that restricted the river 's flow , keeping water levels from being lowered in the Marsh . In July 1893 , a crew of 50 laborers began cutting a channel three feet deep , 200 feet wide , and more than a mile long through the limestone ledge . Even though the ledge was located in Illinois , the excavation work was paid for by a $ 65,000 appropriation from the Indiana state government . The lowering of the ledge had the desired effect , speeding up the flow of the river and allowing drainage of additional areas of the marsh . The \u201c murder of the marsh \u201d had not yet been completed , however : in May 1894 , the Chicago Tribune reported from Momence : \u201c About seventy - five landowners in the Kankakee Valley \u2026 met in this city today to talk over plans for straightening the channel of the Kankakee River from near South Bend , Ind. , to this city in order to secure better drainage for 600,000 acres of marsh land . \u201d That straightening effort would begin in 1902 and last for 20 years . By the time it was completed in 1922 , the Kankakee River in Indiana had been converted from a meandering , 250 - mile - long waterway with 2,000 bends to a series of canal - like , straight - line ditches about 90 miles in length . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Item\": [\"a ledge of limestone\"], \"Place\": [\"a mile upstream from Momence\"], \"Time\": [\"In July 1893\"], \"Agent\": [\"a crew of 50 laborers\"], \"Pieces\": [\"a channel three feet deep , 200 feet wide , and more than a mile long\"]}"}

It 's now time for some painful medicine . ( FORTUNE Magazine ) \u2013 Whatever happens next , the Great Asian Slump is already one for the record books . Never in the course of economic events -- not even in the early years of the Depression -- has so large a part of the world economy experienced so devastating a fall from grace . Latin America , once the world champion when it came to economic instability , has lost the title . Compared with Asia 's debacle , the tequila crisis of 1995 now looks like a minor wobble ; and the once terrifying debt crisis of the 1980s , a positively placid affair . Moreover , Asia is nowhere near having hit bottom : While the region 's currencies seem to have stopped plunging for the moment , its real economies are getting weaker , not stronger . Hong Kong just announced that its economy shrank 2.8 % in the first quarter of 1998 , its worst recession since World War II . Economists predict that Indonesia 's GDP will fall an astonishing 15.1 % this year . Compare that with America 's worst postwar recession year - - 1982 -- when the economy shrank 2.1 % . And it turns out that Japan 's bad bank debt is not $ 550 billion , as previously reported , but a whopping $ 1 trillion ( see following story ) . The repercussions from all this bad news are just now being felt , not the least of which is a case of the jitters for the U.S. stock markets . There have already been many recriminations over whom to blame for this catastrophe . Was it punishment for Asian sins or the nefarious work of evil speculators ? Did the IMF make the best of a bad situation or did it simply pour fuel on the fire ? There is some point to these arguments : Figuring out who lost Asia may help the world keep this crisis , or the next one , from spreading . But the really important question is , Now what ? Do we -- meaning the IMF , the U.S. Treasury , and the afflicted countries -- stick with Plan A , the strategy we 've been following so far ? Or is it time to try Plan B ? And what is Plan B , anyway ? The short answer is that it is time to think seriously about Plan B. And Plan B is fairly obvious -- except that nobody , not even Plan A 's harshest critics , has been willing to talk about it openly . But before we get to that , let 's remind ourselves of how we got here . ASIA : WHAT WENT WRONG By now the outline of how Asia fell apart is pretty familiar . At least in part , the region 's downfall was a punishment for its sins . We all know now what we should have known even during the boom years : that there was a dark underside to \" Asian values , \" that the success of too many Asian businessmen depended less on what they knew than on whom they knew . Crony capitalism meant , in particular , that dubious investments -- unneeded office blocks outside Bangkok , ego-driven diversification by South Korean chaebol -- were cheerfully funded by local banks , as long as the borrower had the right government connections . Sooner or later there had to be a reckoning . Even before the crisis , at a time when foreign banks were still lending and Indonesia 's debt was rated Baa , the facade was beginning to crumble : Big Korean companies were going belly - up ; Thai finance companies were folding . But financial excess , abetted by undue political influence , and a morning - after hangover are not particular to Asia -- remember those Texas thrifts ? The unique aspect of Asia 's comeuppance is not the awfulness of the crime but the severity of the punishment . What turned a bad financial situation into a catastrophe was the way a loss of confidence turned into self - reinforcing panic . In 1996 capital was flowing into emerging Asia at the rate of about $ 100 billion a year ; by the second half of 1997 it was flowing out at about the same rate . Inevitably , with that kind of reversal Asia 's asset markets plunged , its economies went into recession , and it only got worse from there . The upshot -- well , let 's quote from the June report of the Bank for International Settlements , an organization based in Basel , Switzerland , that is not usually given to purple prose : \" The effects of economic slowdowns , asset price collapses , and banking crises tend to be mutually reinforcing as the curtailment of bank credit depresses asset prices and further deepens recessions . This in turn creates additional problems for banks that are forced to retrench still further . ' Vicious circle ' has been an overworked term , but it describes Asia 's crisis all too well . \" SO WHAT DO YOU DO ? In the early days of the Asian crisis , Stanley Fischer -- the economist 's economist who is also the second - highest - ranking official at the IMF -- warned a Hong Kong audience of \" the possibility that [ speculative ] attacks become self - fulfilling prophecies . \" He worried , for instance , that any attack that forces a devaluation and higher interest rates would also weaken the banking system . In other words , you ca n't accuse the IMF of being naive : Officials there understood right from the beginning that the vicious circle the BIS so eloquently describes was a possibility , and they tried their best to prevent it . Working closely with the U.S. Treasury ( whose own No. 2 is , of course , Lawrence Summers , another major economics heavyweight ) , the IMF came up with a strategy that went like this : 1 . Lend the afflicted countries money to help tide them over the crisis . 2 . As a condition for the loan , demand that they reform their economies , eliminating the worst excesses of crony capitalism . 3 . Require them to maintain high interest rates to entice capital into staying in the country . 4 . Wait for confidence to return and for the vicious circle to turn into a virtuous circle . Even in retrospect , this was by no means a stupid strategy . Imagine for a moment that the U.S. had no deposit insurance , and that doubts about a major bank 's management had caused a run by the bank 's depositors . What would the Federal Reserve do ? Well , it would probably lend the bank some cash to meet its immediate needs ; as a condition for the loan , demand that the bank president fire his nephew ; and tell the bank to try to hold on to its depositors by offering them high interest rates . Then everyone would cross his fingers and hope for the best . What 's more , this strategy worked the last time around . In 1995 , Mexico experienced a crisis that , in its early months , seemed worse than the Asian debacle . Robert Rubin and company rode to Mexico 's rescue with a large line of credit ; the Mexicans moved to shore up their shaky banks ; interest rates in Mexico were pushed sky-high ; and then all held their breath . It was a terrible year for the Mexican economy , but in the end everything worked out : Money started flowing in again , interest rates fell , and after slumping 6.2 % the first year , Mexico staged an impressively rapid recovery . In other words , Plan A was the natural thing to try . You might even say that it was inevitable : Given not just the economic but the political logic of the situation , and given the success of a similar strategy in Mexico just two years before , how could the IMF and the Treasury not try to repeat their earlier triumph ? THE CRITICS While the IMF 's response to the Asian crisis may have been a foregone conclusion , that did n't mean that it went unchallenged . From early on there has been a chorus of disapproval , which has left the IMF 's public image badly battered . And some of the critics may have been at least partly right -- but only some of them , because the critics disagree more with one another than they do with the IMF . Roughly speaking , half of them are hard - money types : people who think that the IMF brought on the crisis by encouraging countries to devalue when they should have kept their exchange rates fixed . The other half are soft - money types , who think that the IMF placed too much emphasis on currency stability . They ca n't both be right . Actually , some of them are wrong for sure . The hard - money attack on Plan A -- an attack mainly carried out on the opinion pages of Forbes and the Wall Street Journal , and by other supply - side conservatives -- amounts to saying that Asian countries should have defended their exchange rates at all costs . To have done this in the face of massive capital flight , however , would have meant drastically reducing the quantity of money in circulation -- producing extremely high interest rates , far higher than what the countries have had to impose . And a central bank that ca n't print money because it is required to keep the exchange rate fixed ca n't act as a lender of last resort , providing cash to local banks threatened with runs . ( Argentina , whose \" currency board \" and one - peso \/ one - dollar policy are much lauded by conservatives , could only watch helplessly as its banking sector started to implode in 1995 ; luckily the World Bank came to the rescue . ) If you ask the hard - money types why they think their plans would have worked , why they would n't have produced a worse catastrophe , the only answer you get is that if only Thailand had n't devalued , or if Indonesia had established a currency board , confidence would have returned , and everything would have been all right . Well , maybe -- but it 's a completely circular argument . After all , any economic plan for Asia would have worked if it had instantly restored confidence . Why not skip the currency board and simply tell people to smile more often ? And for those who think that this crisis would n't have happened if only we had been on the gold standard , remember that the last time most major currencies were tied to gold was in 1929 ... The soft - money critics of the IMF , like Harvard 's Jeffrey Sachs -- who think less emphasis should have been placed on currency stability -- had a better case . They argued -- correctly -- that the high interest rates the IMF was demanding of countries would cause severe recessions and financial distress , and that as a result even healthy banks and companies would eventually collapse . So instead of insisting that countries raise interest rates to defend their currencies , they thought the IMF should have told countries to keep interest rates low and try to keep their real economies growing . That advice sounds pretty good , so it 's important to understand why smart people like Fischer and Summers did n't take it . For starters , the way the advice was given -- wrapped in vitriolic accusations that the IMF was both secretive and incompetent -- did n't help . More important , however , the soft - money critics never explained what was supposed to happen to exchange rates . In late 1997 the Korean won lost half its value in a matter of weeks . Would n't it have plunged even further , perhaps even gone into free fall , if Korea had n't raised interest rates ? And would n't that have risked spurring a hyperinflation -- not to mention instantly bankrupting all those banks and companies that had large dollar debts ? These questions never got a clear answer . Jeff Sachs has at times seemed to suggest that lowering interest rates would have strengthened rather than weakened Asian currencies -- that even though investors would have received lower rewards for holding won or bahts , the prospective improvement <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Place\": [], \"Time\": [\"the Great Asian Slump\"], \"Agent\": [\"hardly anyone\"], \"Action\": [\"suggest it\"]}"}

The movie is both slack and dumb \u2014 a trying combo \u2014 and it 's heavily burdened with a big green message . ( The production company , Participant Media , is also launching an earnest new eco-documentary called \" Climate of Change \" at this year 's Tribeca Film Festival . ) Brendan Fraser runs through an alarmingly extensive repertoire of low-comic muggery \u2014 face - scrunches , eye-rolls and general dingbat gibbering \u2014 as Dan Sanders , a real - estate exec who has relocated with his wife and son ( Brooke Shields and Matt Prokop ) to a sylvan outback in rural Massachusetts to oversee the construction of a large housing development . This will of course entail massive despoliation of the woodsy environment , and the local wildlife \u2014 who 've battled similar human incursions dating back to the time of the Vikings , as we 're cornily shown \u2014 are ready to retaliate . Despite their rampant cuddliness , they 're very good at this . The raccoons , foxes , skunks , otters and wild turkeys on hand ( all expertly wrangled for their performances ) are adept at plug-pulling , pee-spraying , boulder - rolling and , inevitably , crotch -biting . Dan is the target for most of this critter abuse , but no one else around him seems able to see it \u2014 even when a raccoon and a skunk drive off in his SUV . ( In a fearful fit at one point , he howls out , \" Miley Cyrus ! \" ) Lurking around the edges of the plot are Wallace Shawn , in the pointless role of a local shrink , and Ken Jeong as Dan 's hypocritical , faux - green employer , who bursts into frequent tirades in wild , squeaky Korean . ( This will surely prove amusing to those viewers who do n't happen to be Korean . ) In the end , of course , Dan finally gets it \u2014 the righteousness of the animals ' cause and the error of his ways . We get it , too , naturally . In fact we already got it 10 minutes into the movie . Again , a kid 's verdict on all of this may be different .

Epic levels In DDO , characters can gain 20 class levels . These are called Heroic levels . With the Menace of the Underdark expansion , characters can continue to accumulate experience points even after taking level 20 , up to 30 . Levels 21 and beyond are called Epic levels . Update 29 introduces a third tier , Legendary , for levels 31 + ; however , this term applies only to game content ( quests \/ adventure areas ) , not to player characters yet , until the level cap increases . What are Epic levels ? [ edit ] Epic levels are a generic class in itself . You no longer gain Heroic levels in any class , but find a new class , \" Epic , \" in your character sheet . While some game mechanics and player conversation may describe you , for instance , as a \" Level 21 Wizard , \" in reality , the game sees you as a Level 20 Wizard with 1 Epic level . This also applies to multiclassed characters . Epic levels do not accumulate heroic action points . Instead , you get epic destiny points which you can invest in Epic Destinies . When you accumulate enough experience , take your epic levels by talking to a Fatespinner ( epic trainer ) . | Level||HP||Saves||BAB||Feats||Misc||XP needed | ( cumulative ) | 21||+10||-||+1|| Epic Feat + Epic Defensive Fighting ||ED Tier 1- 2||600,000 | | 22||+10||+1||-|| Epic Destiny feat ||-|| 1,250,000 | | 23 ||+10 ||-||+1||-||ED Tier 3 , ED Core 2 | | 1,950,000 | | 24||+10||+1||-|| Epic Feat ||Ability increase | | 2,700,000 | | 25 ||+10||-||+1|| Epic Destiny feat ||-||3,500,000 | | 26||+10||+1||-||-||ED Tier 4 , ED Core 3 | |4,350,000 | | 27||+10||-||+1|| Epic Feat ||-||5,250,000 | | 28||+10||+1||-|| Epic Destiny feat || Ability increase | | 6,200,000 | | 29 ||+10 ||-||+1||-||-||7,200,000 | | 30 ||+10||+1||-|| Epic Feat , Legendary feat ||ED Tier 5 | | 8,250,000 | Notes [ edit ] - Epic Feats : Characters that are level 21 or higher may select Epic Feats or Heroic Feats as their level 21\/24\/27\/30 feat selections . - Epic Skills is a special feat automatically granted at each Epic level , giving + 1 to all skills . - Epic Power is a special feat automatically granted at each Epic level , giving +6 Melee and Ranged Power , +6 Universal Spell Power , and - 1 % to the Spell Point cost of all spells . - Epic Knowledge is a special feat automatically granted at every second Epic level starting with level 22 , giving + 1 caster level and +1 maximum caster level with all spells ( for a total of + 5 to all casting classes at level 30 ) . - Epic Destiny Feats granted at levels 22\/25\/28 are a separate list from the Epic Feats and Heroic Feats . - There 's no spell point progress nor caster level progress , however some Epic Destinies have such benefits . - Each epic level grants your summons , pets and hirelings : +5 Melee and Ranged Power , +10 Universal Spell Power , +5 PRR and +5 MRR .

The state 's three prisons for women are at 129 percent of capacity , meaning inmates must sleep in temporary bunk beds in day rooms . Shelves with thousands of inmate files jam what once was a basketball court at the Kate Barnard Correctional Center . It 's the backup for a three - decade - old software program used for recordkeeping . With overcrowded and deteriorating prisons and shortages of corrections officers , Oklahoma 's prison system might appear to be primed for a federal takeover . As if to make the point , the state Department of Corrections last month proposed a budget increase of $ 1 billion in appropriations for fiscal 2019 , similar to last year 's request . \u201c We are not a listing ship , \u201d Corrections Director Joe Allbaugh said recently in his Oklahoma City office . \u201c We are a sinking ship . \u201d But after years of warnings that the federal government could take the helm of corrections and right the ship , it has yet to happen . People are also reading \u2026 Year after year , the inmate population continues to rise , facilities decline , the department turns to private prisons , costs go up , and efforts to lower incarceration rates advance in fits and starts . Allbaugh and other leaders also warned that a riot could erupt , evoking the notorious three - day riot in 1973 that burned much of the penitentiary in McAlester and left three inmates dead . There are some signs that legal action could eventually lead to dramatic changes . But instances of federal courts or agencies taking control of states ' entire prison systems are unusual and scattered . Still , across the country a number of state prisons or county jails answer to federal overseers . And in Oklahoma , it would be a case of repeating history . How the feds intervene The federal government does n't decide on its own to assume control of a state corrections system or send in its own hand - picked people to operate a system or prison . Federal intervention often begins with a lawsuit filed by one or more inmates who allege a pattern of problems or injustices in a facility or a system . The lawsuit may result in a consent decree , with the state agreeing to cede authority over all or part of its prisons and submit to oversight and supervision by the U.S. Justice Department or a judge . The Justice Department also has the authority to investigate jails and prisons and file lawsuits on its own , or join existing lawsuits , in order to force changes . A number of prison or jail systems have faced federal action , including in 2009 when Oklahoma County entered into an agreement with the feds to improve its jail in areas such as mental health services and housing . In Oklahoma , the question is whether life and treatment of inmates in prisons have reached a point where constitutional rights are being violated , which could lead to federal oversight . President Donald Trump 's administration , however , might be less inclined than former President Barack Obama 's administration to intervene . Allbaugh says that absent any changes in the agency 's overall direction , the state could find itself under a federal consent decree . \u201c That is where the Justice Department comes in and tells you how you 're going to run your prison system , and it 's very costly , \u201d he said . Lawsuits simmer It 's common for inmates to sue corrections departments in state or federal court , representing themselves or relying on an attorney . Earlier this week , a federal appeals court revived inmate Joseph Womble 's lawsuit against the Corrections Department alleging that conditions in the state 's prisons violated his constitutional rights . He said temperatures in his cell at the Mack Alford Correctional Center in Stringtown climbed above 90 degrees for half of June 2016 and he became dehydrated . Another lawsuit brought in August by inmates and an advocacy group allege that state officials and private- prison companies are perpetuating high rates of incarceration through the state 's guarantee that it will keep private prisons at least 98 percent full . The inmates have asked the Justice Department to intervene . One inmate , Stephen Craig Burnett , has sued the Corrections Department several times , most recently in 2014 when he was in the James Crabtree Correctional Center in Helena . Serving a life sentence for murdering his wife , Burnett alleges that prisons are overcrowded and understaffed and pose a danger to inmates and officers . The case was dismissed but remains on appeal . Historic case Tulsa attorney Louis Bullock spent much of his career on a landmark Oklahoma case , Battle v. Anderson , involving federal intervention in the state 's prisons . Bullock became the lead counsel for plaintiffs in 1976 , working on the case until 2000 . The Battle case started with about six inmates in the penitentiary and centered on medical care , due process and use of force in 1972 and before . In 1977 , when lawyers had a better understanding of the evidence , the case had grown to include confinement conditions and overcrowding , Bullock said . The litigation also expanded to cover all the state 's prisons and inmates . The lawsuit was filed one year before the 1973 riot , which put the system under further scrutiny . Even so , the \u201c minimally adequate system \u201d that resulted from the lawsuit was \u201c unfortunately a high - water mark \u201d for Oklahoma before conditions worsened , Bullock said . Bullock said there is \u201c little question \u201d that the state is following a path that will lead to a lawsuit and federal oversight of the prison system . \u201c They do not have the capacity to hold the number of people they 're locking up , \u201d he said , adding , \u201c Even from my distance , I can see the deterioration that is taking place , and they have a very real risk that the federal courts will have to take over the prison system again . \u201d Bullock added that money wo n't fix everything : Changes to the criminal justice system also are needed . He 's concerned that the Corrections Department is seeking money to build new prisons rather than focusing on reducing incarceration . \u201c The one lesson that Oklahoma should know by now is that they have never been successful \u2014 in fact , no one 's ever been successful \u2014 in building out of this crisis , \u201d Bullock said . He invoked a line from the movie \u201c Field of Dreams \u201d : \u201c Prisons are like the proverbial ball fields in Iowa . If you build it , they will come . \u201d As to whether federal oversight will happen , corrections director Allbaugh said , \u201c We 'll see . I hate the thought of that because I believe the Department of Corrections is one of the major core functions of government . ... There 's always going to be bad people . \u201d But \u201c if the state does n't demonstrate that they can handle their prison population in a safe and humane way , what are inmates supposed to do ? They 're going to sue . \u201d <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Destroyer\": [], \"Cause\": [\"the notorious three - day riot\"], \"Time\": [\"in 1973\"], \"Patient\": [\"much of the penitentiary\"], \"Place\": [\"in McAlester\"]}"}

In the EpiWafer technology , a thick crystalline silicon layer is epitaxially deposited and subsequently detached after growth to produce a freestanding wafer of standard thickness . Due to the radical changes in the manufacturing value chain , EpiWafers can be produced at an appreciably lower cost compared to the traditional wafer manufacturing process . The EpiWafer is a direct substitute for conventional n- or p-doped silicon mono-crystalline wafers . Now , Fraunhofer ISE reports on substantial progress in the development of its EpiWafers , which are seen as a drop - in replacement for conventional Cz wafers . Fraunhofer ISE 's research team in co-operation with NexWafe has optimized all production steps for the EpiWafer . Analysis of the new n-doped EpiWafers shows that mean minority carrier lifetimes are above 1000 \u00b5s , indicating the same quality as n-type Cz wafers . Solar cells processed on these EpiWafers yield 20 % efficiency , independently confirmed at the Fraunhofer ISE CalLab . \u201c I am elated about this fantastic result , \u201d says Dr. Stefan Janz , Head of the Department of Silicon Materials . \u201c This success attests to our fast progress made in only a few months since focusing on EpiWafers . \u201d The solar cells achieve a short - circuit current of 39.6 mA \/ cm2 , a world - record value for epitaxially grown silicon solar cells . The new results will be presented during the coming European PVSEC in Hamburg . Dr. Stefan Reber , CEO of NexWafe , is also very excited about the new results : \u201c These values demonstrate that our EpiWafer technology is a game - changing technology . It accelerates the shift of the market towards high efficiency modules by providing high quality drop - in mono-crystalline EpiWafers at a very competitive price . \u201d Last modified : <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Agent\": [], \"Items\": [], \"Place\": [], \"Item\": [\"a thick crystalline silicon layer\"], \"Source\": [\"a thick crystalline silicon layer\"], \"Time\": [\"after growth\"]}"}

Warrnambool Standard Advertisement He is destined to be known as the Derrinallum bomb man , but for most of his 49 years Glenn Sanders was a talented mechanic and polite , if offbeat , character , writes MARY ALEXANDER NOISES are amplified on still and chilly nights . A farmer who lives alone wakes in the middle of the night after hearing what he thinks is a massive blast . It 's too loud for a gunshot . It must have been a transformer exploding , but the power is still on . He puts it down to a tremor from an earthquake . Nothing appears to be damaged so he goes back to bed . It 's a problem for the morning . Fifteen kilometres away , a huge explosion has rocked the town of Derrinallum . CFA volunteers are quickly alerted as their pagers signal an emergency . They are needed on the ground just a few kilometres to the west . Donning their trademark yellow uniforms and helmets , they rush to the scene in their trucks . They are told to wait . A few hours pass and they are stood down . There is nothing they can do . In the early hours of Saturday morning the drizzle sets in . The town wakes to the unmistakable drone of police and television helicopters and dozens of police cars . Neighbours are talking , friends ring each other . News broadcasts will soon fill in the missing gaps . Not since 1944 , when bushfires razed the town , has Derrinallum been in the national spotlight . HIS name was Glenn Sanders . He was a kind soul who had developed a troubled mind . His piercing eyes and long , willowy beard were unmistakable around the district . He was known for his generous spirit and his polite and friendly nature . His mechanical prowess was second to none . If you needed something fixed , there was no argument : he was the \u201c go - to \u201d man . Some people referred to him as the \u201c Colonel ' ' because of his beard and the similarities to Colonel Sanders of KFC fame . He reminded others of MacGyver , the television hero who could easily solve complex problems armed only with a roll of duct tape and a Swiss army knife . Eighteen months ago that all changed . He had become volatile , worrying locals with his paranoia , unpredictable behaviour and threats . They saw him out walking the streets with a vest rigged with explosives concealed under his jacket . They could hear blasts coming from his property on the western edge of town and from the cemetery , to the east , at all hours of the night . Advertisement Horrified residents in the close - knit town reported him to police , but officers found no sign of explosives and they did n't have enough evidence to do a full search of his property . They did manage to take his explosives licence away . About a month ago , Glenn Sanders rode the 12 kilometres into Lismore on his Harley - Davidson with his sheepdog on the back . He was n't wearing a helmet . A local takeaway operator suggested he should be worried about getting caught by police or falling off and injuring himself . His response was : \u201c No . When I go , I go big . \u201d That something \u201c big \u201d happened . Just what occurred is under wraps , but it involved a \u201c violent incident \u201d last Thursday week . Someone was troubled enough to make an official report to police , who put Sanders under surveillance with the task of arresting him . Their operation had begun . We now know that police were concerned about items Sanders had strapped to his body . Specialists were called in and began negotiations as soon as he returned to his property about 7 pm on Friday . Advertisement He had not entered his house when they attempted to get him to undress and remove the items . A seven-hour stand - off had begun . Just before 1.30 am his house exploded and , shortly after , the items he was wearing also exploded . The injuries were fatal . Two police officers were also injured and were taken to hospital . Remains , believed to be those of Sanders , were removed from the property on Tuesday afternoon . The highway was closed as soon as the siege began . More than a week later the roadblocks remain in place . The town is still isolated and trade is down . \u201c The Glenn we knew was n't the same Glenn who did this . It was just a different person altogether . He was always such a nice guy . \u201d - Derrinallum Post Office owner Margaret Howard Advertisement Oddly enough , the people of Derrinallum are now willing to forgive all that . And they also seem willing to forgive the man responsible for putting the media spotlight on the town for all the wrong reasons . A simple observation by a woman attempting to bring normality back by enjoying a picnic lunch in the elm avenue with her grandson best reflects that view : \u201c I think we 'll all remember him for what he was \u2014 a great talented man \u2014 rather than what he had become . \u201d Margaret Howard , who runs the post office agrees : \u201c The Glenn we knew was n't the same Glenn who did this . It was just a different person altogether . He was always such a nice guy . \u201d Glenn Albert Sanders was born on November 25 , 1965 at a time when Australia was in the grip of conservatism . Henry Bolte was premier , Sir Robert Menzies was still prime minister after 16 years and Australia had just entered the war with Vietnam . His parents Keith and Margaret Sanders ran the farm at 1370 Hamilton Highway which is now a crime scene . Locals described them as \u201c very placid people \u201d . His brother Andrew was born a few years later . Sanders was a born and bred country boy . He never ventured far from home , attending kindergarten and school at Derrinallum and then gaining an apprenticeship as a motor mechanic just up the road in Mortlake . Advertisement He was a quick learner and was qualified by the time he was just 18 or 19 . Returning home to help on the farm , Sanders dabbled in mechanical work and this eventually became his full - time trade . Rob Jamieson , a fourth - generation farmer at the historic Stony Point property in Darlington , offered Sanders a permanent part-time job in the late 1980s and early 1990s . \" He was n't a mad idiot who had a fetish for blowing things up . He used explosives like it was one of the tools in his toolbox . He was very skilled at it . \" - Clive Jamieson Every week he would spend one day in the farm workshop repairing and servicing machinery and another day restoring old cars and motorbikes for Rob , who was a passionate motor racing enthusiast . Sanders also had a love of racing and restored his own vehicles , competing in speedway and drags . Advertisement Rob 's son Clive Jamieson said the pair had a father - son- type relationship because of their shared interests . \u201c Even though they came from completely different walks of life , dad and Glenn had a very special rapport because of their passion for cars . \u201d Clive , who has known Sanders since the pair were at primary school in the late 1970s , described his welding and engineering skills as \u201c brilliant \u201d . \u201c He was always happy to do whatever task we charged him with even though some of it was probably below him . \u201d \u201c He was n't a mad idiot who had a fetish for blowing things up . He used explosives like it was one of the tools in his toolbox . He was very skilled at it . \u201d As part of his work on farms , Sanders would use an air compressor to remove the muck accumulated in windmill casings and then throw a part-stick of gelignite down the hole to create a cavity for water to accumulate . Advertisement Clive 's family wants to remember Sanders as the \u201c very kind , polite and friendly person \u201d they knew at Stony Point . \u201c We do n't want Glenn 's life to be defined by his final actions . \u201d Sanders also supported another local motoring enthusiast , Gary Poole , in his hobby . Mr Poole , a Derrinallum plumber , is well known for his trip overseas early last year to recreate the historic Monte Carlo rally in his FX Holden with V8 Supercar drivers Craig Lowndes and Richard Davison . Sanders took an avid interest in the project . Mr Poole says the pair had a lifelong friendship and Sanders helped with his other FX Holden race car over many years . \u201c The Sanders boys had a farm ute , an FJ Holden , which he gave to me 25 years ago for parts . \u201d Sanders left the Jamiesons ' employ in the mid-1990s when his business had grown enough with its own clientele . Advertisement \" We do n't want Glenn 's life to be defined by his final actions . \" - Clive Jamieson By that time he was married to first wife Sue , seven years his elder . She would do the accounts but \u201c kept pretty much to herself \u201d . The couple were later divorced and she now lives in a nearby town . His second wife , Shirley Savage from Cobden , had been married twice before and had an adult daughter from her first marriage . Shirley was well known around the district for the distinctive \u201c Cobden \u201d registration plates on her Prado four- wheel - drive . She also owned a motorhome and an old Austin A50 Cambridge car which Sanders had restored . Photographs from the bomb site show the three vehicles intact at the edge of the pile of rubble and twisted metal that was once Sanders ' substantial home and several sheds . Advertisement His mother 's house also remains standing . Some people say he knew exactly what he wanted to destroy and what he wanted to leave using carefully placed explosives . The pair would often visit the picturesque farm that Shirley still owned on Boundary Road in Cobden , staying overnight in a rustic old cottage . Neighbours would report the sound of night - time explosions coming from the deep valley at the bottom of the property . \u201c He seemed to be a bit of a larrikin , \u201d said one Cobden resident who met him . Another friend remembers gatherings around bonfires : \u201c He loved being the centre of attention . \u201d He recalls nights when Sanders would set explosives in dead cows , blowing their heads off and sending blood and guts in the air as a \u201c party trick \u201d . Shirley was diagnosed with cancer and their life was turned upside down . She urged Sanders to keep her illness quiet and did n't want any fuss . But friends say he needed an outlet and wanted to talk . He was stuck in a catch - 22 . Advertisement Her death , about 18 months ago , appears to be the catalyst for a different Sanders to emerge . \u201c Shirley 's death rocked him big time . He slipped into depression . \u201d Shirley had willed him her Cobden farm but there were challenges over her estate and financial issues he had to deal with . Sanders gradually lost faith in the legal system and with authority in general . \u201c Shirley 's death rocked him big time , \u201d a friend said . \u201c He slipped into depression . \u201d Many people kept their distance . Friends tried to talk and reason with him . He was referred to a psychiatrist but he shunned the offers of support . Advertisement \u201c He refused help from anyone or if he did take it , he ignored it , \u201d one friend said . \u201c He 'd fallen through the cracks of the mental health system . \u201d They feared he was also abusing drugs , saying his weight and hair loss and the deterioration of his teeth certainly pointed to this . His paranoia was also a symptom . Sanders became a recluse . He padlocked the gates to his property and worked alone , using earth - moving equipment and digging holes on his land to bury items as if he was \u201c planning something \u201d . He would visit Shirley 's unmarked grave at the Derrinallum cemetery , picking up a take - away meal on the way . He would sit on her plot eating pizza and drinking his favoured tipple of bourbon and lemonade , discarding the empty cans when he left .

Jonathan Freedland in The Guardian wrote : \" That claim , which has been repeatedly debunked , was instantly applauded and <event> spread <\/event> by the same crowd of pro-Russia voices on the far left and far right who have served so dutifully as Assad 's online cheerleaders . \" <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> There was a time when , even if we disagreed about the remedy , we did at least agree that the patient was sick . We might argue about the meaning of this or that event , but all sides usually accepted that the event in question had at least happened . No longer . A new and unsettling dimension has entered our collective , and global , conversation . In the US James Comey , the former FBI director sacked by Donald Trump , released his memoirs and did a round of TV interviews . The FBI has not always enjoyed or deserved public trust \u2013 under its founder , the bigoted and brutal J Edgar Hoover , minorities and trade unionists had good reason to fear it \u2013 but in recent decades it came to be seen as one of the trusted arbiters of American life , a non-partisan referee whose word would be accepted . That would be truer still of the figure at the helm , the nation 's top law enforcement officer . Now , of course it 's natural that Comey 's book would not be hailed as a definitive , objective account of recent , highly contested events . It was not sworn testimony , but an autobiography with all the self - flattery and exculpation associated with that genre . But what was striking was the casual dismissal even of the facts in the book . Trump and the Republican party instantly trashed the ex-director \u2013 himself a Republican \u2013 launching a website : lyincomey.com . You can argue about Comey 's judgment and his self - righteousness \u2013 which make parts of the book read like reflections of The Simpsons ' Ned Flanders \u2013 but his opponents go further , waving aside even that which is verifiably true . The more egregious example is also the more serious . At a concert in Barcelona , the former Pink Floyd star Roger Waters accused the Syria Civil Defence , or White Helmets \u2013 the volunteers who pull survivors from the rubble of bomb attacks , and are widely credited with saving thousands of civilian lives \u2013 of being \u201c a fake organisation that exists only to create propaganda for the jihadists and terrorists \u201d . That claim , which has been repeatedly debunked , was instantly applauded and spread by the same crowd of pro-Russia voices on the far left and far right who have served so dutifully as Assad 's online cheerleaders . To them , Waters was a hero for daring to speak an unpopular truth . For everyone else , a once admired musician had joined the ranks of conspiracist cranks and apologists for a murderous dictator . The remark by Waters fitted a story the Assad denialists have been telling for a while : that the chemical attack in Douma was fake , staged by the White Helmets and their western friends . Russian state TV even aired footage that , it claimed , showed a film set where such atrocities are cooked up . ( The pictures were , in fact , taken from the set of a Syrian feature film . ) Remember , these voices are not simply saying western air strikes were the wrong response to the killings in Douma . They are saying there were no killings in Douma . Or there were , but they did n't involve chemical weapons . Or they did , but rebel groups were responsible . Or the whole thing was staged by Britain . The line changes with dizzying frequency . The point is , whether it 's Comey or Syria , we are now in an era when the argument is no longer over our response to events , but the very existence of those events . It was the same story after the mass school shooting at Parkland , Florida , in February . A loud chorus of rightists was not content merely to denounce proposed gun control measures : they claimed the massacre had not happened at all , and that all those grieving parents and teenagers were \u201c crisis actors \u201d . These are symptoms of a post-truth disease that 's come to be known as \u201c tribal epistemology \u201d , in which the truth or falsity of a statement depends on whether the person making it is deemed one of us or one of them . According to the writer David Roberts , \u201c information is evaluated based not on conformity to common standards of evidence or correspondence to a common understanding of the world , but on whether it supports the tribe 's values and goals and is vouchsafed by tribal leaders . ' Good for our side ' and ' true ' begin to blur into one . \u201d Of course , we all suffer from confirmation bias , and all of us listen more to our friends than to our foes \u2013 but this goes further . Recall the Trump spokesperson Scottie Nell Hughes , who declared : \u201c There 's no such thing , unfortunately , any more as facts . \u201d For many Americans , Hughes explained , Trump 's tweets , regardless of the evidence , \u201c are truth \u201d simply because they come from him . It fits that social media is the weapon of choice . Its algorithms are proven to favour virality over veracity , spreading false stories faster and wider than true ones . A mysterious pro-Assad tweeter , with no other traceable existence online , has nearly as many followers as the BBC 's Middle East editor . Meanwhile , the top story on Google News the morning after the US presidential election hailed Trump as the winner of the popular vote \u2013 even though he had lost it by nearly 3 m votes . The tribe tells itself what it wants to hear . The desire to stand with your fellow Republicans or Assad apologists is so great you 're ready to throw out not only your opponents ' arguments but their evidence too . And because trust in all the previously respected referees \u2013 from the media to human rights organisations to the FBI \u2013 has collapsed , you refuse to believe anything and anyone that contradicts you . The danger this poses is clear . Comey 's moment will pass , but eventually his predecessor at the FBI , special counsel Robert Mueller , will deliver his report into the Trump campaign 's alleged collusion with Russia . Already Trump 's Fox News outriders are trashing Mueller \u2013 another Republican - appointed straight arrow whose honesty has never been credibly questioned \u2013 branding him biased , corrupt , even \u201c the head of a crime family \u201d . That will make it easier to ignore his findings , however damning . If Richard Nixon were in office now , even Watergate would not be Watergate : his own tribe would simply dismiss the hard , factual evidence against him . As for Syria , Waters and the rest may seem like fringe voices , but such thinking eventually leaks into the mainstream . On yesterday 's Question Time , Emily Thornberry echoed the Russian claim that chemical weapons inspectors were being kept out of Douma by UN red tape and health and safety rules \u2013 when in fact it is Assad and Russia keeping them out : long enough , presumably , to ensure that by the time they 're granted access the crucial evidence will have been cleared away . It makes for a chilling landscape , a world where atrocities are committed twice over \u2013 once when they are done , and again when they are denied . Not decades later , but even as the dead are still being buried . The great division of our time may not , after all , be between left and right or open and closed , but something more fundamental still : between what is true and what is false . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Individuals\": [\"That claim\"], \"Agent\": [\"by the same crowd of pro-Russia voices on the far left and far right who have served so dutifully as Assad 's online cheerleaders\"], \"Place\": [\"online\"], \"Cause\": [\"to speak an unpopular truth\"], \"Time\": [\"in an era when the argument is no longer over our response to events , but the very existence of those events\"]}"}

At about 1136 Eastern Standard Time , the aerodrome controller \u2013 east ( ADC1 ) cleared TXH for take - off . At about 1137 , the pilot of a Cessna 172 aircraft , registered VH- EUU ( EUU ) , contacted the surface movement controller ( SMC ) on the Ground frequency and requested a clearance to taxi for a local private flight , with three passengers on board . The SMC cleared EUU to taxi to runway 35R via taxiway A , and the pilot commenced taxiing . The pilot of TXH reported that the take - off run was normal , but after rotation , the engine intermittently ran roughly , and then regained full power . At about 1138 , the pilot advised the ADC1 of engine trouble and requested a return to land . The ADC1 observed that TXH did not appear to be climbing out normally and was then quite low , and offered the pilot runways 22 or 31 if required . The pilot elected to use runway 22 . The ADC1 advised the SMC and the aerodrome controller \u2013 west ( ADC2 ) of an aircraft with engine trouble , and coordinated with the SMC for runway 22 . At about 1139 , the ADC1 cleared TXH to land . The pilot of TXH conducted a tight right turn towards runway 22 and the aircraft touched down about one third of the way along the runway . The ADC1 and SMC observed that TXH appeared to be still travelling fast . The pilot of TXH assessed that he was not going to be able to stop the aircraft prior to the end of the sealed runway , but that there was a suitable grassed overshoot area beyond it . The ADC2 was standing up , sighted EUU on taxiway A , and alerted the SMC . As TXH approached the end of runway 22 , the pilot sighted EUU on taxiway A to his right , and veered to the right in an attempt to pass behind EUU . The SMC directed EUU to stop . The pilot of EUU braked immediately and sighted TXH , but assessed that if he stopped there , TXH would collide squarely with EUU , so he released the brakes and progressed forwards . The left wing of TXH then collided with the tail of EUU . The pilot of TXH was not injured . The pilot and passengers of EUU were treated for minor injuries . Both aircraft sustained substantial damage . Aviation Short Investigations Bulletin - Issue 41 Read report What happened On 11 April 2015 , the student pilot of a Piper PA - 28 aircraft , registered VH-TXH ( TXH ) , prepared to conduct a solo , local flight , from Moorabbin Airport , Victoria . The flight was to be the pilot 's second solo to the training area , where he was to practice simulated forced landings . The pilot inspected the aircraft , including checking the oil quantity and colour . He noted that the dipstick indicated 5.5 L of oil and the oil appeared to be of a golden colour . After completing the pre-flight checks , the pilot of TXH taxied the aircraft to the run - up bay and performed engine run-ups . He noted that all indications were normal and within the required performance limits . At 11:29:06 Eastern Standard Time ( EST ) , the pilot made a radio call to the Moorabbin surface movement controller ( SMC ) on the Ground frequency , advising that he was conducting a solo flight to the training area and requested a departure from runway 35 Right ( 35R ) . The SMC cleared TXH to taxi via taxiway A for a departure from runway 35R. TXH then taxied to the holding point for runway 35 R , and , at 11:36:37 , the pilot of TXH contacted the aerodrome controller \u2013 east ( ADC1 ) on the Tower East frequency . He reported ready for take - off , and ADC1 cleared TXH for take - off . At 11:37:08 , the pilot of a Cessna 172 aircraft , registered VH- EUU ( EUU ) , contacted the SMC and requested a clearance to taxi for a local private flight , with three passengers on board . The SMC cleared EUU to taxi to runway 35R via taxiway A , and the pilot commenced taxiing . The pilot of TXH reported that the take - off run was normal , with the engine indications in the normal range . After rotation , when about 150 ft above ground level ( AGL ) , the engine began to run roughly . The pilot lowered the aircraft nose slightly and within 2 - 3 seconds , the engine regained full power and the aircraft continued to climb . When approaching 500 ft AGL , the engine again ran roughly and partially lost power . The pilot suspected a fuel issue to be the cause of the rough running , and , as the fuel pump was still on , changed the selected fuel tank . The engine returned to producing full power and the pilot initiated a right climbing turn , leaving the fuel pump switched on . As the aircraft climbed , the engine lost power again . At 11:37:58 , the pilot advised ADC1 that he had a ' spluttering engine ' and requested a return to land . ADC1 had observed TXH in the initial climb and noted that it did not appear to be climbing out normally and was then quite low , at an estimated 300 ft AGL . ADC1 initially responded that TXH was number one for runway 35 R and then offered runways 22 or 31 if required . The pilot responded that he would use runway 22 ( Figure 1 ) . ADC1 gave TXH priority to land over all other aircraft , advised the SMC of an aircraft with engine trouble , requested runway 22 , and coordinated with the SMC for release of runway 22 ( see section : Air traffic control ) . The SMC checked the crossing taxiways , helicopter traffic and for any works in progress that may have conflicted with the use of runway 22 , then handed ADC1 the green runway strip for runway 22 . ADC1 then placed the strip in the runway bay on the console . ADC1 also coordinated with the aerodrome controller \u2013 west ( ADC2 ) , who instructed a couple of aircraft in the circuit for runway 35 Left ( 35L ) to go-around to ensure they remained clear of the crossing runway . ADC1 instructed the pilots of two aircraft that were in the circuit for runway 35R to go-around and another to conduct a full stop landing . The SMC reported then focusing on checking the runways and taxiways crossing runway 22 . Taxiway A did not cross runway 22 , and as the SMC remained seated , was unable to see EUU on taxiway A as it was obstructed by the tower console . Source : Google earth annotated by the ATSB At 11:39:06 , ADC1 cleared TXH to land on runway 22 . The pilot of TXH conducted a tight right turn towards runway 22 and as he was concerned about clearing the buildings on the approach to runway 22 , he did not select any flap . After passing over the buildings , the pilot reduced the power to idle . He reported that the aircraft touched down about one third of the way along runway 22 . ADC1 observed that TXH appeared to land about half way along the runway and did not decelerate normally after touching down . The SMC observed that TXH appeared very low on final approach to runway 22 and crossed the threshold travelling very fast . The ADC1 stated to the SMC and ADC2 controllers ' he 's landed long ' and ' gee he 's quick ' . The pilot of TXH assessed that he was not going to be able to stop the aircraft prior to the end of the sealed runway , but that there was a suitable grassed overshoot area beyond it , and maintained the aircraft on the runway centreline . ADC2 was standing up , and sighted EUU on taxiway A. ADC2 alerted the SMC to the Cessna ( EUU ) on taxiway A. ADC1 observed that EUU was then still north of the extended centreline of runway 22 on taxiway A . As TXH approached the end of runway 22 , the pilot of TXH sighted EUU taxiing on taxiway A to his right , and was unsure whether it was going to stop or not . He veered TXH to the right in an attempt to pass behind EUU and avoid a collision . At 11:39:25 , the SMC directed EUU to ' hold position , STOP , STOP ' . The pilot of EUU braked immediately and as his body moved forward in response to the aircraft braking , he sighted TXH in his left peripheral vision . The pilot of TXH saw EUU brake suddenly . The pilot of EUU assessed that if he stopped there , TXH would collide squarely with EUU , so he released the brakes and progressed forwards . The left wing of TXH then struck the tail of EUU and spun EEU around through about 180\u00b0 . TXH continued veering to the right for about 20 m further before coming to rest on a grassed area ( Figure 2 ) . Source : Airport Operator The pilot of TXH observed fuel spilling from the ruptured fuel tank and immediately exited the aircraft and reported that he was not injured . The pilot of EUU reported that he momentarily lost consciousness at the time of the collision , but came to within seconds . He then observed fuel leaking , and although feeling disoriented , he conducted a normal aircraft shut down , including switching off the aircraft electrics and fuel . He and the passengers disembarked and were treated for minor injuries . Both aircraft sustained substantial damage ( Figures 3 and 4 ) . Source : Airport operator Source : Airport Operator Pilot comments The pilot of TXH provided the following comments : - He did not declare an emergency as he assessed that he would be able to land the aircraft safely . He remained calm and focused on his approach to , and landing on , runway 22 . - He wanted to ensure that if the engine failed completely he would have sufficient height to clear the buildings in the approach path of runway 22 . - He did not have sufficient altitude to continue a circuit and land on 35R . - He was unable to stop the aircraft before the end of runway 22 , but if there had not been an aircraft on the taxiway , he would have been able to stop safely in the overshoot area . The pilot of EUU commented that as he was on Ground frequency and the pilot of TXH was on Tower frequency , he was not aware of TXH until he sighted it immediately prior to the collision . He reported that if he had been directed to stop earlier , it may have <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Dodger\": [\"a Piper PA- 28 , VH- TXH\"], \"Bad_entity\": [\"a Cessna 172 , VH-EUU\"], \"Time\": [\"11 April 2015\"], \"Place\": [\"taxiway A\"]}"}

However it is considered that the area around Lincoln continued to be culturally and \/ or politically <event> dominated <\/event> by its former Romano-British inhabitants with their culture and institutions only gradually declining through the fifth century with the label ' Anglo - Saxon ' potentially becoming more generally appropriate towards the end of the sixth century . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> The fifth and sixth centuries in Britain are difficult in many ways , not least the great variety of names which are applied to this period by academic historians . For some these centuries continue to be a ' Dark Age ' , a name that is often criticised but which still finds its way into fairly recent book titles . For others it is the ' Heroic Age ' , as in the title of a current academic journal concerned with this period , whilst others go for more sober but still very telling names such as the ' early Anglo - Saxon ' period , the ' sub- Roman ' period , ' Late Antiquity ' or even the ' Brittonic ' \u2014 ' British ' \u2014 era . Each of these names does , of course , suggest a variety of conflicting conclusions as to the nature of these centuries and what actually took place in them . Given this , the question I want to ask here is , quite simply , how appropriate are any of these names for use when describing Lincolnshire in the fifth and sixth centuries ? | The Lincoln region in the late Roman period and after , showing the landscape of the region , the location of Lincoln , and the likely boundaries of one of the four late Roman provinces of Britannia controlled by this city ( drawn by C. R. Green ) . Dark blue represents the sea , green permanently dry land , and light blue the wetlands and salt - marshes ; the siltland around the Wash is striped to reflect its low-lying nature and origin as marine deposits in this period . For further details of this map , see here . | A variety of evidence might be cited in support of such a model , the most important of which are the great cremation cemeteries of the region . The scale of these sites does need to be emphasised \u2014 whereas in most of eastern Britain , ' Anglo - Saxon ' cemeteries of the fifth and sixth centuries rarely contain more than a couple of hundred of burials and more often contain only a few tens , the largest of these sites contain thousands . Indeed , Lincolnshire boasts two of the three largest fifth - and sixth- century cemeteries known from England , with over 1,800 graves excavated from the Loveden Hill cemetery ( out of a potential original total of c. 3,000 ) and over 1,500 excavated at Cleatham . Indeed , it seems likely that these cemeteries acted as social and sacred ' central places ' for sizeable surrounding territories and their inhabitants , many of whom were buried in the main cemetery , whilst others were buried in surrounding subordinate small cemeteries . All told , given that such cremation - cemeteries have cultural links to the Anglo - Saxon ' homelands ' on the continent , there seems little reason to doubt the reality of ' Anglo - Saxon ' immigration into this region ; indeed , Lincolnshire looks to have been one of the primary foci of this immigration on present evidence . | The major early Anglo - Saxon cremation cemeteries of the Lincoln region , set against the late \/ post - Roman landscape ( image drawn by C. R. Green , based on Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig. 11 ) . | | The site of Loveden Hill Anglo - Saxon cremation cemetery in the southern Lincolnshire district of Kesteven ( image : C. R. Green ) . | However , we do need to be careful here . Even if we add in the smaller , later fifth - to seventh - century Anglo - Saxon inhumation cemeteries known from the Lincoln region , which have a much wider distribution than do the large cremation cemeteries , it has to be admitted that there are still significant issues with the notion that Lincolnshire in the fifth and sixth centuries was wholly ' Anglo - Saxon ' . First , there are still large gaps in the distribution of both the cremation and inhumation cemeteries by the end of the early Anglo - Saxon period , with none at all known from the Fenland territory of the supposedly Anglo - Saxon Spalde , nor from extensive areas to the north of the River Witham and to the east of the River Trent . Second , even in those areas that had at least some culturally Anglo - Saxon cemeteries by the seventh century , there are still notable differences in the quantity and date of the material found . For example , in the ' peripheral ' Loveden and Kirton - in - Lindsey areas we have thousands of burials dating probably from the fifth century onwards in the great Anglian cremation cemeteries , with sometimes many hundreds in the nearby inhumation cemeteries of this area too ( for example , the inhumation cemetery at Sleaford probably contained around 600 burials ) . However , closer to Lincoln itself , most of the known cemeteries apparently present by the seventh century only contain 5 , 10 or 15 graves , and a phasing of these indicates that small Anglo - Saxon inhumation cemeteries only really encroached into the area around Lincoln after the early sixth century . Given this significant variance in the density and date of early Anglo - Saxon burials across Lincolnshire , we do have to wonder whether it is really appropriate to speak of the fifth - and sixth-centuries in Lincolnshire as being wholly and entirely ' early Anglo - Saxon ' , especially early on in this date - bracket , when the immigrant culture appears to have been even more limited in its spread than it was by the end of the period . | An enamelled Class 1 brooch from East Ravendale , Lincolnshire ( image : Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig. 14 ; also available on the PAS ) | | An apparent hybrid British Type G\/ Class 1 enamelled brooch from Norton Disney , Lincolnshire ( image : Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig. 17 ; also available on the PAS ) | If Lincolnshire cannot be considered wholly or entirely ' early Anglo - Saxon ' even by the start of the seventh century , and appears to have been even less so in the fifth and earlier sixth centuries , what then was it ? In this light , it is worth considering further the fact that significant areas appear to have been empty of , or only sparsely populated by , culturally Anglo - Saxon graves in this era . If they were not entirely devoid of population and abandoned , a hypothesis now generally considered to be extremely unlikely , then were they were culturally and \/ or politically dominated by the former Romano -British inhabitants of this region ? In other words , was Lincolnshire , or at least parts of Lincolnshire , in some way ' sub - Roman ' or even ' Late Antique ' in these centuries , perhaps with the local Romano -British culture and institutions only gradually declining through the fifth century and the label ' Anglo - Saxon ' potentially becoming more generally appropriate towards the end of the sixth-century ? Once again , there is considerable merit in this position , with a strong case to be made for the former Romano -Britons of Lincoln having continued to control a large area around the city into at least the early sixth century . The avoidance of the former provincial capital by the major cremation cemeteries of this region is in itself important evidence for such a post - Roman British territory , offering a very marked contrast to the situation at and around other major Roman centres in eastern and northern Britain such as York , Leicester , and Caistor - by - Norwich , where significant Anglo - Saxon cremation cemeteries are found close by . This avoidance of Lincoln can be very clearly seen on the second map above , with the nearest large cremation cemetery to Lincoln being that at Loveden Hill , over 27 km to the south of the city . Furthermore , as was noted above , the small inhumation cemeteries similarly only really start to encroach on Lincoln after the early sixth century , something which is again suggestive . However , the cemetery evidence does not stand alone . Only a selection of the evidence can be cited here , but of particular note is the fact that the name of a post - Roman British territory focussed on Lincoln \u2014 * Lind\u0113s \u2014 was actually preserved in both British and Anglo - Saxon sources and names , most importantly in the seventh - century Anglo - Saxon kingdom - name Lindissi and the modern district - name Lindsey , both of which derive from the Late British territory - name * Lind\u0113s rather than any Old English name . Moreover , the Anglo - Saxons of Lincolnshire 's own name for themselves \u2014 the Lindisfaran , ' the people who migrated , faran , to the territory of * Lind\u0113s ' \u2014 makes explicit reference to the fact that they arrived as migrants into this British territory of * Lind\u0113s . Similarly , there is now a remarkable quantity of British fifth - and sixth-century high- status metalwork known from the Lincoln region , which suggests a significant degree of post - Roman British activity here and the presence of British elites throughout the region . Perhaps most notable of all , however , is the fact that a recent reconsideration of the radiocarbon and other data from the excavated apsidal church at St Paul in the Bail , Lincoln , indicates that this was almost certainly a British church of the fifth\u2013sixth centuries that was located in the centre of the Roman forum and able to hold up to 100 worshippers , not a later Anglo - Saxon construction as has sometimes been suggested . | Reconstruction of the apsidal church at St Paul in the Bail , Lincoln , within the Roman forum ( image : extract of Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig. 13 , by David Vale \/ SLHA ) | | The distribution of early Anglian cremation - predominant cemeteries , represented by filled squares , plotted against Saxon artefacts of the second half of the fifth century , represented by stars , and the Late Roman provincial boundaries ( image : C. R. Green , published as Green , Britons and Anglo - Saxons , fig , 21a ) . | As such , a label ' sub - Roman ' , or even ' Late Antique ' , would seem to have some applicability to the Lincoln region , especially for the fifth and earlier sixth centuries . Indeed , there are even hints that a vestige of Roman provincial control from Lincoln survived at least some way into the fifth century . Although we do need to be cautious here , it has been suggested that a real distinction appears to be observable between a mainly Anglian cultural zone and a mainly Saxon one in the archaeology of the fifth century , and that the dividing line between the two accords surprisingly well with the most recent reconstruction of the Late Roman provincial boundaries , with early Anglian cremation - predominant cemeteries being nearly all located within the province controlled by Lincoln . Equally , a tentative case can be made for the major cremation cemeteries of Lincolnshire having been sited in a ring around Lincoln as part of a deliberate defensive scheme for the protection of the former provincial capital \u2014 not only are the cemeteries at or close to potential strategic sites , but their distribution is very similar in pattern to that of the apparent last stage in the deployment of the late Roman army in the Lincoln region ( based on recent artefactual studies ) , leading to the suggestion that the people who used these large cemeteries may have been tasked with a similar defensive role with regard to Lincoln . Needless to say , both suggestions would add weight to the case for the region being effectively ' sub - Roman ' in the earlier part of the period , <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [\"the fifth and earlier sixth centuries\"], \"Agent\": [\"Romano -Britons of Lincoln\"], \"Patient\": [\"Anglo - Saxon\"], \"Place\": [\"Lincoln and its surrounding territory\"]}"}

Baugher , Joe . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> This series on the Shooting Star concludes with an account of its service life . The service history of the Shooting Star begins in 1944 , when the decision was made to deploy four service test YP - 80 As to Europe to demonstrate their capabilities to combat crews and to help in the development of tactics to be used against Luftwaffe jet fighters . 44-83026 and 83027 were shipped to England in mid-December 1944 , but 44-83026 crashed on its second flight in England , killing its pilot . 44-83027 was turned over to the British government and modified by Rolls - Royce to flight test the B -41 , the prototype of the Nene turbojet . On November 14 , 1945 , 44-83027 was destroyed in a crash landing after an engine failure . 44-83028 and 83029 were shipped to the Mediterranean . They flew some operational sorties , but they never encountered any enemy aircraft . They were both returned to the USA after the war . The tenth , eleventh , and twelfth YP - 80 As were delivered in early 1945 to the 31st Fighter Squadron of the 412th Fighter Group at Bakersfield Municipal Airport in California for service tests . The first production P-80A was accepted by the AAF in February of 1945 . The group relocated to Santa Maria AAF , California in July of 1945 . It moved again in November of 1945 to March Field , California . After the war in Europe was over , P -80 As began to replace the P-51 D and the few P-59 As which had served with stateside units . The first 17 P-80 As off the line were assigned to the 31st Squadron of the 412th Fighter Group , supplementing the YP - 80 As that the Group had already received . More P-80 As went to the 29th and the 445th Squadrons of this group in the summer of 1945 . This group was in preparation for deployment to the Pacific when Japan surrendered . In the summer of 1945 , approximately 30 P-80 As were sent aboard an aircraft carrier to the Philippines in preparation for the final assault on Japan . The planes were to be issued to the 414th Fighter Group , based at Florida Blanca . Unfortunately , the planes had been sent without their tip tanks and their aircraft batteries , so they sat aboard the aircraft carrier for 30 days waiting for this equipment . By the time that the batteries and wingtip tanks were delivered , the war in the Pacific had ended , so the P -80 never got a chance to enter combat in the war against Japan . The initial accident rate for the P-80A was alarmingly high . On July 1 , 1945 , Lt Joseph Mandl was killed when his P - 80A ( 44-85017 ) stalled on takeoff and plowed through a fence and struck a parked A - 26 . On August 2,1945 , Major Ira Jones was killed when his P - 80A ( 44-83029 ) fell apart in midair in a flight over Kentucky . August 6 , 1945 , Major Richard Bong , Medal of Honor holder and leading USAAF fighter ace with 40 victories in the Pacific , was killed when the engine of his P-80A-1 -LO ( 44-85048 ) exploded shortly after takeoff . By that time , no less than eight YP - 80 As and P-80 As had been destroyed in crashes , seven had been severely damaged , and six pilots had been killed . The day after Bong 's fatal crash , the USAAF ordered the Shooting Star grounded until the problems could be corrected . The grounding order was lifted on November 7 , but was soon followed by another grounding , this time caused by problems with the J33 - A-9 jet engine . The aircraft was cleared for flight shortly thereafter , but the accident rate still remained high , with no less than 61 Shooting Stars being involved in accidents by September of 1946 . Most of these accidents were not the result of any critical flaws in the basic design of the Shooting Star , but were caused primarily by errors on the part of pilots inexperienced with the particular idiosyncracies of jet aircraft . In spite of its high accident rate , the USAAF was anxious to show off its new jet fighter to the public . On January 26 , 1946 , three P-80A-1 -LOs equipped with auxiliary fuel tanks in place of the guns and ammunition broke the transcontinental speed record between Long Beach , California and LaGuardia Airport , New York City . Carrying standard 165 - US gallon wingtip tanks , Captain Martin Smith 's 44-85113 and Captain John Babel 's 44-85131 completed the trip respectively in 4 hours 33 minutes 25 seconds and 4 hours 23 minutes 54 seconds , which included a refuelling stop in Topeka , Kansas . The fastest time -- 4 hours 13 minutes 26 seconds for an average speed of 580.93 mph over 2453.8 miles was obtained by Col. William Council who was able to fly nonstop since his aircraft ( 44-85123 ) was fitted with special 310 - gallon drop tanks . Three months later , Col. Council flew a P -80A from New York to Washington DC in 20 minutes 15 seconds . In June 1946 , Lt. Henry Johnson set a 1000 - km speed record of 426.97 mph . In the first postwar National Air Races held in Cleveland in August of 1946 , Shooting Stars won three trophies : the Bendix Trophy awarded to Col Leon Gray for flying an FP- 80A from Van Nuys , California to Cleveland in 4 hours 8 minutes , the Thompson Trophy 180 - km closed circuit race won by Colonel Gustav Lundquist in a P -80A , and the Weatherhead Jet Speed Dash Trophy won by Lieut W. Reilly at a speed of 576.4 mph in a P -80A . The P-80A won the Bendix and Thompson trophies again in 1947 . In order to show off the USAAF 's new jet fighter , in May of 1946 , twenty - five P-80 As of the 412th Fighter Group toured the United States . However , the 412th Fighter Group was inactivated in July of 1946 after completing the operational evaluation of the first two USAAF jet fighters , the P-59A and the P-80A . Apart from the four P - 80s that had been sent to Europe just prior to V-E Day , the first overseas P -80s were issued to the 55th Fighter Group under Col Horace Hanes , which received 32 Shooting Stars for its 38th Fighter Squadron based at Gibelstadt in Germany . This unit evolved into the 31st Fighter Group . In 1946 , Shooting Stars were delivered to the 38th Squadron of the 55th Fighter Group and the 27th , 71st , and 94th of the 1st Group stationed in the USA , the 31st Group ( 307th , 308th , and 309th Squadrons ) based in Germany , and the 18th Fighter Bomber Wing ( 12th , 44th , and 67th Squadron ) based on Okinawa . In early 1946 , 30 P-80s were sent to the 414th Fighter Group at Florida Blanca Airbase on Luzon in the Philippine Islands . In November 1946 , twenty - five P-80 Bs of the 94th Squadron were taken to Alaska for six months of cold - weather testing . The 363rd Reconnaissance Group was activated at Brooks Field , Texas in July of 1946 , and received FP - 80 As . In 1947 , the following groups got the Shooting Star -- the 4th Group ( 334th , 335th , 336th Squadrons ) and 56th Group ( 61st , 62nd , and 63rd Squadrons ) based in the USA , the 36th Fighter Bomber Group ( 22nd , 23rd , and 53rd Squadrons ) based in Germany , and the 51st Interceptor Group ( 16th , 25th , and 26th Squadrons ) based in Japan . Sixteen F-80A \/ F-80 Bs of the 56th Fighter Group left Selfridge Field , Michigan on July 7 , 1948 and made a multi-stop transatlantic flight and then took part in two weeks of training in Germany . In 1948 , F-80 Cs began to reach operational units , the first being the 57th Interceptor Group ( 64th , 65th , and 66th Squadrons ) based in Alaska and the 49th Fighter Bomber Group ( 7th , 8th , 9th Squadrons ) based in Japan . Later in 1948 , the 36th Fighter Group took no less than 80 F-80 Bs from Florida to the Canal Zone before moving permanently to Germany . In 1949 , the 23rd Group ( 74th , 75 , 76th Squadrons ) and 81st Group ( 91st , 92nd , and 93rd Squadrons ) , both stationed in the USA , received Shooting Stars . In the same year , the 8th Fighter Bomber Group ( 35th , 36th , and 80th Squadrons ) based in Japan received F-80 Cs . The 35th Interceptor Group ( 39th , 40th , and 41st Squadrons ) based in Japan received F -80 Cs in early 1950 . By the late spring of 1950 , F-80 Cs equipped twelve Far East Air Force ( FEAF ) squadrons based in Japan -- the 7th , 8th , and 9th Squadrons of the 49th Fighter Bomber Wing based at Misawa , the 35th , 36th , and 80th Squadrons with the 8th Fighter Bomber Wing based at Itazuke , the 39th , 40th and 41st Squadrons with the 35th Fighter Interceptor Wing at Yokota , and the 16th , 25th and 26th Squadrons with the 51st Fighter Interceptor Wing at Naha . RF - 80 As equipped the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron at Yokota . When North Korea invaded South Korea on June 25 , 1950 , four groups equipped with the P -80C ( the 8th , 51st , 49th , and 35th ) were based in Japan , as well as the 8th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron flying FP - 80 As . Shooting Stars saw action from June 26 onwards , taking off from their bases in Japan and flying as escorts for transports and as interceptors . On June 26 , four Shooting Stars intercepted eight North Korean Ilyushin Il - 10 attack aircraft and shot down four of them , scoring the first combat victories for an American jet fighter . On June 28 , RF - 80 As began flying operational reconnaissance sorties , while the F-80 Cs began to fly ground attack missions in support of the retreating South Korean forces . On June 30 , the ban against air operations over North Korea was lifted , and the initial commitment of US troops was approved . During the early days of service in Korea , pilots complained that the F -80 was too fast <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [\"November 7 , 1950\"], \"Agent\": [\"F - 80C # 49-0737\"], \"Cause\": [\"shot down\"], \"Patient\": [\"MiG- 15\"], \"Place\": [\"near the Yalu River\"]}"}

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate 2004-07-04 04:00:00 PDT Los Angeles -- In a business better known for dull uniformity than bold personality , Dov Charney is a dynamo who has found success selling an unlikely mix of T- shirts , sex and social responsibility . On the factory floor at American Apparel -- the company he runs just outside of the Garment District here -- he 's the loud , lanky boss with mutton chops , a rock - star demeanor and an often- discussed love life that seems outsize even by Los Angeles standards . But in an industry that has all but fled American soil for cheaper labor elsewhere , he 's also the businessman who has pledged his loyalty to homegrown apparel , above - average wages and worker - friendly factory conditions . On billboards and in magazines , Charney sells youth and sex appeal packaged in extra-soft , snug T-shirts . Through shrewd marketing , he has commandeered a significant slice of the market , infusing a high level of fashion into an everyday wardrobe item . The formula has brought American Apparel rising sales and national attention . But the question remains : Can he continue to do well and do good ? His marketing acumen could falter , his rivals could offer similar high - fashion T- shirts at lower prices , and fleeting styles and tastes could shift . Pressure could build to compromise the workplace ideals on which he has built the business . \" His goals are very , very laudable , but I think a lot of people in the industry are watching to see if he 's going to be able to survive , \" says Jack Kyser , chief economist with the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. , a private nonprofit that promotes jobs and industry . With his edgy , out - front image , Charney does n't seem like a man who is worried . He is a portrait in confidence , an unsubtle and sometimes off - color company spokesman prone to manic populist discourses . He 's unapologetic about American Apparel 's in - your - face marketing , his confrontations with unions , and his love affairs with employees and women who model his T-shirts . Stories about Charney 's personal life , which circulate in industry circles and have been featured in media coverage of American Apparel , sometimes overshadow more-serious portrayals of the business he 's building , he says . \" There 's a lot of love , and a lot of commitment , and a lot of passion and blood and tears that have gone into this company , \" Charney says . \" And there are many hardworking people there that are extremely passionate that I 've never had any romantic relationship with . \" Four years ago , he pulled his then- little - known rag business into profitability after years of red ink . He did n't do it selling boxy , mass - market T-shirts . Instead , he weaves thin - fiber cotton yarn into styles favored by urban trend - seekers in cities such as San Francisco and New York . A basic women 's T-shirt from American Apparel is priced at about $ 16 retail . Much of the company 's business comes from small , independent designers who buy the shirts wholesale , embellish them with original touches and resell them in boutiques for $ 30 or more . It 's a niche market that distantly trails the multibillion - dollar reach of brands such as Hanes and Fruit of the Loom . But American Apparel reported $ 80 million in sales last year , and Charney says he expects to reach $ 140 million this year . The company opened its first retail stores last year , in New York and Los Angeles , and Charney plans to have 25 locations by the end of the year , possibly including San Francisco . Bucking the offshore trend American Apparel weaves its fabric and cuts and stitches its T-shirts , fleece pants , pullovers and panties in an immense , adobe- pink former railroad warehouse in downtown Los Angeles . A huge banner that hangs outside proclaims the company \" an industrial revolution . \" Its sewing - machine operators commonly make more than $ 500 a week working fewer days and shorter hours , with more-generous benefits and generally better working conditions , than most other garment workers in the city , according to industry observers and independent worker advocates . In recent years , much of the Los Angeles garment industry has moved away from manufacturing in favor of importing . At the same time , American Apparel has grown from 1,200 workers a year ago to nearly 2,000 , most of them Latinos who live in low-income neighborhoods . \" I 'm only 35 . You name another 35 - year - old who 's changing this many lives , \" Charney says during a factory walk - through , in the midst of a running commentary that ranges from free - market trade to cotton shrinkage and prisons in Iraq . Yet questions remain whether Charney 's business model can be broadly adopted to bring large - scale apparel manufacturing back to the United States . Charney argues that higher labor costs can be offset by happier and more - efficient workers , generating higher profit . Two decades of industry trends refute the notion . Major apparel brands such as Gap and Ralph Lauren subcontract with factories in dozens of countries outside the United States in their search for the right balance of design , quality and labor costs . \" American Apparel is an anomaly . It 's not the status of the industry , nor is it the future of where the industry is going , but it is functioning extremely well based on the model it has designed for itself , \" says Ilse Metchek , executive director of the industry - backed California Fashion Association , and LA By Design , a marketing program under the private Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp . ' Sweatshop Free ' marketing American Apparel keeps things simple , sticking with cotton tops and bottoms that require a narrow range of machinery and skills to produce . The company stresses the made - at-home mantra . American Apparel clothing tags , catalogs and billboards declare the goods \" Sweatshop Free . \" Yet , it 's unclear how much that message registers with its wholesale customers and individual shoppers . \" Customers are more attuned to quality \" than to anti-sweatshop marketing , says Roxy Buu , who owns the San Francisco boutique Buu , in San Francisco 's Hayes Valley , which carries designers who use Charney 's T-shirts . \" When I see that a shirt is American Apparel , I know it 's good . \" Los Angeles County 's roughly 67,000 apparel workers do n't make many commodity clothing products , says Kyser , the economic-development economist . The region 's garment shops more routinely churn out quick- turnaround , inexpensive fashions for specialty retailers such as Forever 21 and Wet Seal , or higher - end goods for upscale retailers such as St. John Knits . Basic apparel competes heavily on price , which generally means overseas production , Kyser says . On the factory tour , Charney -- dressed in a pink cotton - jersey leisure shirt made by his company -- seems confident that he can thrive . The company is built on more than some do -gooder social mission , he insists . \" No one can stop this , \" Charney says over the hum of sewing machines , punching the air with his fist and whooping at his workers , inviting them to shout back in a kind of impromptu pep rally . \" I 'm paving a new method of distribution . ... I have to rebuild part of America ! \" Some workers grin . They say that theatrics are typical for the boss . A lifetime in T-shirts Charney 's mother is a painter and his father a Harvard - educated architect . He first sold T-shirts as a Montreal high - school student , buying them at U.S. Kmarts and trucking them back to Canada . T-shirt brokering led to manufacturing , which led Charney to South Carolina in the early 1990s . The industry was highly competitive and increasingly moving offshore . Charney moved to Los Angeles in the summer of 1997 and partnered with Sam Lim and other garment - industry veterans to get American Apparel off the ground . The company turned a profit in 2000 after shifting its focus to fashion - conscious youth , Charney says . A tireless promoter , he has worked the floors at major trade shows such as the Magic Marketplace in Las Vegas , often flanked by models handing out American Apparel ClassicGirl Ts and women 's briefs . According to Charney , the \" Sweatshop Free \" tag has built up the company 's image but also caused headaches . The designation , combined with the company 's success , makes him a prime target of what he calls \" the liberal , PC - oppressed left . \" \" Is it a cooperative ? Is it unionized ? Are you objectifying women ? \" he says , listing the questions he says he gets from anti-sweatshop activists and union organizers . \" Of course we 're objectifying women . You want a smock ? Go to the Middle East . \" Life on the factory floor The factory is not unionized . Last year , Charney and the Union of Needletrades , Industrial and Textile Employees , AFL - CIO , or UNITE , tangled over an organizing drive . The effort failed , and at one point hundreds of American Apparel workers staged a protest against the drive . The union says that the company management intimidated workers . \" By the third day of our campaign , people were not receptive . They were very afraid , \" says Cristina Vazquez , UNITE 's regional manager in California and international vice president . She contends that American Apparel should set an example for other , smaller factories in the city by embracing the union . UNITE , in a complaint to the National Labor Relations Board , contended that Charney had meddled in union talks with employees . In a non-monetary settlement , Charney , who denied wrongdoing , agreed to post flyers spelling out workers ' collective - bargaining rights , have the list of rights read aloud to employees and stay out of future talks . Kimi Lee , director of the independent , nonprofit Garment Worker Center in Los Angeles , says that the center typically supports UNITE 's organizing efforts . But , in the case of American Apparel , the center did not believe that workers would benefit . The Garment Worker Center hears few complaints from American Apparel workers , and those that come up are typically minor and resolved relatively easily , Lee says . They tend to stem from a lack of management experience among floor supervisors who have been promoted with little training , as a result of the company 's fast growth , she says . \" Dov believes in a happy workforce , \" and that 's reflected in the factory conditions and salaries , Lee says . American Apparel workers can take free English - language classes and yoga classes on - site . They have free Internet access and massage therapy and subsidized lunches and bus passes . Employee health care has been privatized and subsidized by the company for about a year and a half , Charney says . \" This is the only factory where I 've been content , where I have been happy , \" says Benigno Navarro , 36 , of Los Angeles , who has worked there a year . He sews T-shirt hems . During his decade in the city 's garment factories , the husband and father of three rarely earned more than $ 30 or $ 40 a day at other factories , often working from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. , and had no health benefits , he says in Spanish . At American Apparel , he says that he works 7:45 a.m. to 4 p.m. most days , with a lunch break <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Earner\": [\"Benigno Navarro\"], \"Earnings\": [\"$ 30 or $ 40\"], \"Time\": [\"a day\"], \"Place\": [\"at other factories\"]}"}

High - tech games and simulations are second nature to today 's students . For educators and researchers , those virtual worlds offer the freedom to create innovative digital tools that tap into children 's motivation outside the classroom and generate excitement about science . As prominent an authority as the National Research Council has extolled the potential of computer games and simulations to better engage young people in science learning and promote a deeper understanding of and facility with the subject . \u201c They enable learners to see and interact with representations of natural phenomena that would otherwise be impossible to observe \u2014 a process that helps them to formulate scientifically correct explanations for these phenomena , \u201d the NRC said in a recent report . \u201c Simulations and games can motivate learners with challenges and rapid feedback and tailor instruction to individual learners ' needs and interests . \u201d The Minnesota Zoo 's evaluation of its own game found \u201c that kids were learning the science , were more interested in wolves , and were more interested in science as a result of playing the game , \u201d Mr. Spickelmier said . In WolfQuest , players learn about wolves by embarking on missions that a wolf would typically undertake , such as feeding and taking care of pups . Players take the role of the animal and are presented with response options when they encounter certain situations , such as the presence of other wolves . For example , when interacting with a potential mate , players can choose to leave the interaction , take a defensive stance , play , or show interest in the wolf . They are rewarded for choosing authentic wolf behavior . Wolf Quest is a multiplayer game with a chat function that allows participants to talk to one another . Launched in 2007 , it continues to receive thousands of hits daily . Although the game was created primarily for children to access on their home computers , the zoo has increasingly been contacted by teachers interested in incorporating it into their classrooms , Mr. Spickelmier said . The zoo has since crafted curricular materials to help connect the game with what students are learning in class , he said . ' Playful Experimentation ' At the New York Hall of Science , a hands - on science and technology center in New York City , digital tools are helping draw the connections between a day at a museum and children 's lives at home and at school . \u201c One of the things you struggle with in an informal science - center environment is that kids come , they have a blast , but they do n't necessarily leave with anything , \u201d said Margaret Honey , the president and chief executive officer of the facility . \u201c The potential of digital tools to capture and then allow for playful experimentation post -fact is really cool . \u201d For instance , children can enter their height and weight into a computer and wear radio-frequency identification bracelets as they go down giant slides in the science playground . The bracelets record data about the speed , velocity , and friction of their journey . They can then add other factors into the mix \u2014 like going down the slide on different materials , such as vinyl or felt , and holding weights \u2014 to manipulate the data and look at the relationship between the changes the children make and the read - outs they receive . \u201c What underlies the whole initiative [ of the center ] is really paying attention to the dynamics of what motivates students ' engagement , \u201d Ms. Honey said . \u201c Keeping that playful and entertaining and slightly humorous is really important to creating the right kind of positive emotional residue toward science learning . Particularly in this day of high -stakes accountability , it 's the joy and passion and deep motivation for learning that we 've lost . \u201d Inside a Virtual World Whyville , a virtual - learning environment for children started in 1999 , was created by James Bower , the chief executive officer and founder of Whyville.net . \u201c Our original intent was to build games and network - based worlds for use in schools and out of schools and connecting the two , \u201d he said . \u201c And we are just now crossing that threshold , which is being accelerated by the fact that states are deciding to go with digital curriculum . \u201d Unlike games , Whyville is an unstructured online environment where players participate in activities to earn \u201c clams \u201d \u2014 the form of currency in Whyville . Through partnerships with companies and organizations , such as Dell , Toyota , and NASA , players can explore a host of activities . For example , the infectious \u201c WhyPox \u201d was introduced into Whyville , prompting a series of responses from its residents , who covered the outbreak in the Whyville Times , the player- organized newspaper . \u201c They did n't know it was coming , \u201d said Mr. Bower , the chief executive officer of Numedeon Inc. , which runs Whyville . \u201c They just started breaking out . \u201d The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later came in and \u201c vaccinated \u201d players against the disease . The Texas Workforce Commission has also partnered with the virtual world to finance a bioplex \u201c where kids actually do research on how you develop antibodies , different types of viruses , and how they work , \u201d Mr. Bower said . The power of Whyville comes from the children 's interest in exploring and asking questions , he said . \u201c We finally have the technology to ' scale ' Socrates , \u201d he said . \u201c We have n't had the technology to do it right until now . \u201d This story was underwritten by a grant from the Noyce Foundation , at www.noycefdn.org.

But there was a tiny handful of settlements where all those who served returned home . With its rows of ramshackle yellow stone cottages , set amid undulating Cotswold hills , the village of Upper Slaughter belies the violence of its name . In hazy autumn sunlight , this corner of Gloucestershire might well have been rendered in watercolour . All the components of tourist - brochure Britain are here - the red phone box , the winding lanes , the wisteria draped around the windows . But one normally ubiquitous feature is missing . Unlike the overwhelming majority of British settlements , Upper Slaughter has no war memorial . Instead , tucked away in the village hall are two modest wooden plaques . They celebrate the men , and one woman , from the village who served in both world wars and , in every case , returned home . For it is not only its postcard charm that offers pacific contrast to the name Upper Slaughter . It is that rarest of British locations , a \" thankful village \" - the term coined in the 1930s by the writer Arthur Mee to describe the handful of communities which suffered no military fatalities in World War I . Mee identified 32 such places , a figure that has been revised upwards in recent years to 52 . Of these , just 14 have , like Upper Slaughter , come to be known as doubly thankful - also losing no -one from WWII . Somehow , these rare outposts - as disparate and evocative - sounding as Nether Kellet , Lancashire ; Woolley , Somerset ; and Herbrandston , Pembrokeshire - were shielded from the worst ravages of the first half of the 20th Century . Some of those they sent to fight may have returned home badly injured or deeply traumatised , but all came back alive . The scale of their good fortune is extraordinary . A million British lives were lost from 1914 - 18 in Europe 's first experience of industrialised , total warfare . No Scottish community appears to have been left unscathed , and no thankful villages have been identified in Ireland , all of which was still part of the UK during WWI . In England and Wales , the 52 so far singled out are dwarfed by over 16,000 which paid the highest sacrifice . In terms of the UK 's collective memory of 1914 - 18 , they represent a striking anomaly . Through history lessons , war poetry and popular culture , the abiding modern portrayal of WWI is as a devastating event of industrial - scale carnage . And yet this handful of communities , whose sons emerged alive from the horrors of the trenches , offers a unique insight into the experience which shattered the pre-WWI order and , in turn , transformed society irrevocably . One man who understands this is Tony Collett , an energetic 80 - year - old who has lived and worked in and around Upper Slaughter all his life . Tony was too young to have served in either world war . But after WWII he hand - painted the lettering on the plaque celebrating the 36 men from the village who came home safely . Standing in the village hall , he looks up , pauses , and places a hand on the wooden sign , before telling its story . It was erected in 1946 alongside a similar marker put up to give thanks for the 24 men and one woman of Upper Slaughter who returned in 1918 . Both the WWI and WWII versions included the name of Tony 's father , Francis George Collett , the village 's resident handyman , universally known by his middle name . Born in 1895 , George had the rare distinction of serving in two world wars . After enlisting at the age of 19 , he was sent to Mesopotamia , now Iraq , where 92,000 of the 410,000 Commonwealth troops died . As a member of the Territorial Army , Sgt Collett was one of the first to be called up in 1939 , coming under fire before long as an anti-aircraft gunner with the Royal Artillery on the home front . But it was not only those in uniform like George whose lives were at risk . On 4 February 1944 , Upper Slaughter faced an attack from the sky , with incendiary bombs raining down on the village . \" I saw it through the skylight , \" recalls Tony , who was 14 at the time and sharing a room with his sister . \" The first thing we did was dive down under the blankets . \" We came out and saw all these flames . We were dodging fires all the way down the road . \" It was 05:30 GMT , and the village was burning . Several cottages and barns had been hit . But the people of the village quickly assembled , gathering water and sand to douse the flames . Though the damage was severe , Upper Slaughter 's luck held - no-one was killed . In 1946 , it seemed natural to put up another plaque . The village hall had been acquired by the local Witts family after WWI to mark the armistice . Newly demobilised George , the village 's odd - job man , church sexton and occasional undertaker , was given the task of creating a second marker to give thanks for the men who had just come back . With his son assisting , George carved the wooden plaque , styling it to match that from 1914 - 18 . Tony then carefully painted the 36 fortunate names . Another sign , on the other side of the hall , was fashioned from brass to commemorate the \" distinguished conduct and promptitude \" shown by Upper Slaughter 's residents on the night of the incendiary bomb raid . Every time they passed the building , the people of the village were reminded of their incredible luck . And yet amid the wreckage of make - do- and - mend austerity Britain , with so many communities shattered and families destroyed , it felt unseemly to discuss this . After all , during the first half of the 20th Century , Upper Slaughter was very much the exception . While people in this corner of the Cotswolds were quietly grateful for what they had escaped , the vast majority of their compatriots were adjusting to the most profound of losses . For every village like Upper Slaughter there was another like Wadhurst , East Sussex - a place of just over 3,500 people which lost 149 men in WWI , according to research by the historian Paul Reed , author of Great War Lives . On a single day in 1915 at the Battle of Aubers , 25 men from Wadhurst were killed - just under 80 % of all those who went forward into no -man 's land , and almost certainly the heaviest per capita casualties of any community in the UK for one day 's battle . The majority of the fallen had no known grave . Indeed , according to the WWI historian Dan Snow , it was often small communities , villages and hamlets in which the psychological burden of the carnage 's aftermath was most painfully felt . Largely to blame for this , Snow believes , was the system of Pals Battalions - units of friends , work colleagues and relatives who had been promised they could fight alongside each other when they enlisted amid the patriotic fervour of 1914 . The battalions were a useful recruiting tool for War Secretary Lord Kitchener , who believed that mobilising large numbers of enthusiastic recruits quickly was the best method of winning the war . But the reality of the trenches , where thousands of men could be wiped out in a single day , meant that small communities could face disproportionate levels of bloodshed within a matter of hours . Of about 700 \" pals \" from Accrington , Lancashire who participated in the Somme offensive , some 235 were killed and 350 wounded within just 20 minutes . By the end of the first hour , 1,700 men from Bradford were dead or injured . Some 93 of the approximately 175 Chorley men who went over the top at the same time died . It was a pattern repeated many times - and on each occasion , a town or village was deeply wounded , instantly . The \" pals \" system was phased out in 1917 , but not before it left an indelible mark on the British consciousness . \" They had to stop that practice because it was so unbelievably destructive , \" says Snow , whose great-grandfather Sir Thomas D'Oyly Snow was a general at the Somme . \" When you let brothers serve together , it can be devastating for a whole community . It was a war that touched everybody in the British Isles . That 's what total war means . \" The UK may have lost 2.2 % of its population , but in other belligerent nations the toll was even higher . France lost 1.4 million , some 4.3 % of its citizens . The French equivalent of a thankful village is even more extraordinary . Thierville in Normandy has not lost any service personnel in France 's last five wars - the Franco - Prussian war of 1870 , World Wars I and II , Indochina , and Algeria . Of course , even those in the thankful villages in the UK did not escape the hardships and disruption imposed by total war . By 1918 , rationing was in force and everywhere on the home front would take many years to recover . Likewise , the fortunate veterans who made it home alive were scarcely unscathed . Many were permanently damaged by their experiences , whether physically or mentally . By the end of WWI , the Army had dealt with 80,000 cases of \" shell shock \" - psychological trauma caused by war experiences . \" Soldiers can return , but it might be with their bodies or their psyches scarred , \" says Peter Englund , author of The Beauty And The Sorrow : An Intimate History of the First World War . Nonetheless , given the scale of the losses , and the fact that virtually no family was left intact , it is scarcely surprising that the notion of thankful villages proved comforting to a British public which was still reeling from the war long after the armistice . The phrase was first used by Mee - a celebrated writer and journalist best known for his 1908 Children 's Encyclopaedia - in The King 's England , a 193 <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Expressor\": [], \"State\": [], \"Event\": [], \"Topic\": [\"losing no -one from WWII\"], \"Stimulus\": [\"losing no -one from WWII\"], \"Experiencer\": [\"Herbrandston\"], \"Time\": [\"the first half of the 20th Century\"]}"}

It 's Saturday morning and we 're relaxing on the sofa with a coffee , idly scrolling through Twitter while MTV Classics plays in the background . The 1992 video for Roy Orbison 's posthumously released track ' I Drove All Night ' plays . Now , we 're partial to Roy , the American singer - songwriter behind such classics as ' You Got It ' and ' In Dreams ' . He rose to fame in the ' 60s and was in the midst of a career renaissance in 1988 when a heart attack took him at the age of 52 . His back catalogue enjoyed a revival shortly afterwards , thanks partly to the prominent use of his signature track in the hit film Pretty Woman . Consequently , despite hailing from an earlier generation , Orbison 's songs fire up late ' 80s , early ' 90s nostalgia for us in the same way as double denim and Hypercolor t-shirts . Mention his name in conversation and ' video games ' are unlikely to come up . Nintendo fans might be able to dredge up the trivia nugget that he ( and his trademark glasses ) inspired his namesake Koopa Kid courtesy of Nintendo of America 's English translation of Super Mario Bros. 3 , but the musician was from a different generation ; an analogue generation . Owing to the fact he 'd been dead for four years at the time of production , a spectral Orbison appears in the ' I Drove All Night ' video via snippets of distorted archival footage while Jason Priestley and Jennifer Connelly cavort in moody monochrome . An impossibly attractive couple \u2013 the objects of approximately 98 % of teenage crushes of the era \u2013 Priestley does his best James Dean impression behind the wheel as he drives to meet Connelly in the middle of the desert . On arrival , the two young stars then frolic on the car bonnet and other locations , generally enjoying each other 's company for the rest of the song . As we took this nostalgia trip and cursed the ravages of Mother Time , we suddenly bolted upright at a brief shot of a van the two lovers ride past , spilling our coffee as we did a cartoon - style double - take . No , it could n't be . Grabbing the remote we hit rewind just to make sure and there it was , plain as day : Skip to 3:14 in the video to see for yourself . For some reason \u2013 for the briefest of moments \u2013 Roy Orbison was plugging Super Mario Bros . from beyond the grave . Other split-second references occur throughout the video : This is perplexing for multiple reasons . Even if he was an avid gamer ( which seems unlikely ) , of all the potential artists that might have prompted early ' 90s kids to race down to their nearest gaming emporium and pick up the latest release , Roy ' Only - the - Lonely ' Orbison would have been very low down the list \u2013 somewhere between Ringo Starr and your gran . We ca n't imagine his seal of approval being the envy of consumer electronics brands in any decade , least of all the too- cool - for-school ' 90s . MC Hammer ? Perhaps . Vanilla Ice ? At a push , but Roy Orbison !? Too square , too operatic , and \u2013 frankly \u2013 too dead . Who on earth thought this would be a fruitful crossover for either party ? We had to know , and the rest of our morning was spent in search of an explanation . We should remember that this period was arguably ' peak ' Mario \u2013 or perhaps more accurately , peak Nintendo . The Super Mario Bros. Super Show ! was on TV , The Wizard had whipped up incredible levels of anticipation for Super Mario Bros . 3 before it landed in the US , and the summer of ' 91 saw the arrival of the Super Nintendo with Super Mario World ( PAL territories would have to wait until the following year ) . Sure , John Connor might have mocked the mainstream Nintendo kids in Terminator 2 while he skipped school and ripped off ATMs in his Public Enemy t-shirt , but he was being hunted by a liquid metal killing machine ; the average kid his age was Mario mad . Consequently , the plumber appeared in all sorts of places up until 1993 when the failure of the infamous Bob Hoskins live - action movie made Nintendo realise its brand could be damaged through hasty tie-ins . It put the brakes on such practices , and has arguably only recently begun branching out again with theme parks and animated movie deals . This haphazard approach to licencing presumably enabled MCA Records to get its hands on the plumber 's likeness to promote a compilation album that you may or may not be familiar with . Nintendo : White Knuckle Scorin ' is a very strange album , to say the least . Ten tracks long , it includes ' I Drove All Night ' and it , too , gets a reference in the video ( skip to 2:38 ) . While the cover could n't be more ' 90s if it tried , only the opening song by Jellyfish , ' Ignorance is Bliss ' , has any lyrical ties whatsoever to Super Mario . The remainder of the compilation is apparently made up of random tracks MCA Records had lying around the place , thrown onto a Nintendo -labelled disc because , well , those idiot kids will buy anything plastered with Mario 's face , wo n't they ?! Kotaku ran a short article on the album eight years back after Negative World posted some highlights , if they can be called such , of a short comic that came in the album sleeve . This comic weaves the song titles into a contrived narrative featuring Mario and friends . Each title is crowbarred awkwardly into one of the characters ' speech bubbles and , for the particularly slow reader , another character invariably drives the point home with a knowing ' Song cue ' . Closer examination of the comic reveals the ostensive reason for the entire endeavour \u2013 it 's an ill-conceived pro-literacy project . Set in Dinosaur Land , Yoshi and the Koopa Kids learn to read courtesy of Princess Peach ( or Toadstool here ) , while perennial loser Bowser subscribes to the mantra ' ignorance is bliss ' ( song cue ) . It 's complete nonsense but fascinating all - at-once ; a hodgepodge of ' 90s vernacular and a ( presumably mandated ) selection of hilariously inappropriate ' big ' words . For example , Princess Toadstool , the ' babe ' with the ' dynamite bod ' , stuffs magical spell book pages down her ' d\u00e9colletage ' . Head over to Negative World for a more thorough look at the liberties taken with your favourite video game characters , but suffice it to say , it 's utter rubbish . You 've got to hand it to whoever knocked this up , though ; effort has gone into this rubbish . Stringing together such woefully unrelated tracks in a Mario-branded pro-literacy wrapper was a thankless task . The result is an intriguing oddity from the height of Mario mania , for sure , but why exactly were these songs thrown together on the disc ? Were there no more fitting alternatives ? Sure , Dire Straits were a big deal at the time , but Mark Knopfler 's sombre reflection of a violent clash during the UK miner 's strike was even less likely to win over the target demographic than Roy 's contribution . Stranger still , Virgin Records \u2013 not MCA \u2013 held the rights to Orbison 's back catalogue , so getting this song on its Nintendo compilation involved work on MCA 's part , certainly more than simply sweeping the recording studio floor for random offcuts and B-sides . Examination of ' I Drove All Night 's ' single sleeve provides a vital clue . On the reverse we found the following dedication from Orbison 's wife : Bobby Brooks was Roy 's agent and friend . I am so pleased that Roy 's song , \u201c I Drove All Night \u201d pays tribute to Bobby 's memory . Roy always felt that children are our future . The work of the Bobby Brooks Foundation will promote literacy in children and ensure a more promising future for us all . The single features two ' B-sides ' , both by other artists taken from White Knuckle Scorin ' . Further investigation of this Bobby Brooks character uncovered a contemporary L.A. Times article from November 1991 highlighting the release of both the single and White Knuckle Scorin ' itself ( unfortunately , European readers may have trouble accessing the article due to geo-locking ) . Despite a few inaccuracies ( the article claims White Knuckle Scorin ' is \u201c a soundtrack album for a new Nintendo video game \u201d ) , it sheds some light on the thinking behind the project . Bobby Brooks was an agent for various artists ; 'a tremendous guy , a very funny man ' according to another of his clients , Eric Clapton . Brooks was tragically killed in the same 1990 helicopter crash that also claimed legendary guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan . According to the article , White Knuckle Scorin ' was the brainchild of MCA Chairman Al Teller \u2013 a somewhat confused attempt to fuse a tribute to the departed Brooks with a compilation album to ' tap the Nintendo youth market ' . In addition to playing Nintendo , literacy was apparently a cause close to Brooks ' heart and provided the album 's wholesome raison d'\u00eatre , with a cut of proceeds going to form a foundation in his honour . It seems that Bobby Brooks had worked ( in some capacity ) with the majority of the featured artists on the compilation ; the tangential link between this strange selection of songs . The peculiar dual role of ' Nintendo - branded album for the cool kids ' and tribute to Brooks seems to have left the album in an awkward no - man 's land , satisfying neither function . None of the songs are an obvious fit for the ' Nintendo youth ' demographic Al Teller was reportedly targeting , although it 's conceivable the two objectives were inextricable . If the Nintendo licence were contingent on the pro-literacy angle provided by the Brooks connection ( therefore limiting the tracks MCA had to work with ) , that would provide a reasonable explanation for this conceptually odd Nintendo tie - in that features veteran folk rockers Crosby , Stills & Nash rubbing shoulders with Sheena Easton , while Roy Orbison warbles \u201c I drove all night ... to make love to you \u201d . We all know sex sells , but really ? Which brings us back to the video . Perhaps MCA was contractually obliged to include Nintendo references in it or maybe stipulations from Virgin Records or Orbison 's widow prevented Mario from being jammed into every frame . Alternatively , perhaps Nintendo got cold feet with the ' love- making ' references and put the brakes on the collaboration . Its licencing department vetting procedures evidently were n't so stringent in those days , but you 'd assume MCA would want more than some blink - and - you ' ll - miss - them White Knuckle Scorin ' references in the final product . It 's all very odd indeed . We encourage you to check out the eclectic mix yourself . Tracking down your very own copy is possible , although we 'd recommend just having a listen to this YouTube playlist instead . Having solved the mystery of Roy Orbison 's posthumous endorsement of the House of Mario to our satisfaction , the album made for an appropriately surreal end to a surprising morning . Join us next week when we 'll be hunting obscure Metroid references in Miami Sound Machine lyrics . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Experiencer\": [\"Bowser\"], \"Stimulus\": [\"ignorance\"]}"}

Security Council strongly condemned what it called \" mob attacks \" on U.S. and other embassies in Belgrade on Thursday sparked by anger at Western support for Kosovo 's declaration of independence . A statement by the 15 - nation council recalled the inviolability of diplomatic missions under an international convention but welcomed steps by Serbian authorities to restore order . The unanimous statement was issued after U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Zalmay Khalilzad expressed outrage at the attacks and said he would demand that the council condemn them . The main violence in Belgrade was against the U.S. embassy , which was set on fire , but attacks were also reported against the missions of Germany , Croatia , Britain , Turkey and Bosnia . \" The members of the Security Council condemn in the strongest terms the mob attacks against embassies in Belgrade , which have resulted in damage to embassy premises and have endangered diplomatic personnel , \" the statement said . It recalled that a 1961 Vienna Convention obliged host governments to protect embassies , but also said the council \" welcomes the steps taken by the Serbian authorities to restore order and protect diplomatic property and personnel . The statement was toned down from an original draft which used the term \" outrage \" and implied that the Serbian government was not meeting its obligations under the Vienna Convention . Serbia , which has fiercely opposed the independence of its province of Kosovo , is strongly supported within the council by Russia , which has sought unsuccessfully to have the United Nations declare Sunday 's declaration illegal . Kosovo has already been recognized by the United States and a number of European Union countries .

The general intent of the ESIGN Act is spelled out in the first section ( 101.a ) , that a contract or signature \u201c may not be denied legal effect , validity , or <event> enforceability <\/event> solely because it is in electronic form \u201d . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Mon , 03\/16\/2009 - 18:51 Go to the Main Laws page On June 30 , 2000 President Clinton signed the \" Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act \" ( ESIGN ) using his electronic signature ID , and thereby established the validity of electronic signatures for interstate and international commerce . In the four years prior to this Act 's passage a dozen states had passed similar laws and guidance for state specific business purposes , and in the five years since the Act 's passing every other state has passed similar laws and legislation . What does it all mean , and in the end how can it benefit businesses , individuals and the nation or world as a whole ? The best way to answer a question like this is to take a look at the origins of the law , and understand the reasoning behind its passage and the passage of federal and state laws . Over 100 years ago , people were using Morse code and the telegraph to electronically accept contracts . An early validation of electronic signatures came from the New Hampshire Supreme Court in 1869 [ Howley v. Whipple , 48 N.H. 487 ] . \" It makes no difference whether [ the telegraph ] operator writes the offer or the acceptance in the presence of his principal and by his express direction , with a steel pen an inch long attached to an ordinary penholder , or whether his pen be a copper wire a thousand miles long . In either case the thought is communicated to the paper by the use of the finger resting upon the pen ; nor does it make any difference that in one case common record ink is used , while in the other case a more subtle fluid , known as electricity , performs the same office . \" But it was the invention of another wired box that brought electronic signatures into everyday usage . In the 1980 's companies and even some progressive individuals began using fax machines for high priority or time sensitive delivery of paper based documents . Today , the fax machine is a staple of the business world . Most people do not even consider the original hurdles this new medium created , nor do they consider its impact on the speed of communication and the advantages of its use . However in its infancy many of the same issues surrounding electronic communications and electronic signatures had to be resolved when utilizing the facsimile . When the first contract was signed and faxed it created the basis for the discussion of electronic signature validity . After all it was the first time someone could sign something , place it in a machine , send it from one phone line to another and deliver a digitally reproduced signature . The path this signature took was not controllable or traceable , and in most cases it traversed miles of wire before reaching its destination , so how could it be considered a valid signature ? The intentions of the signature were clear to everyone , but businesses wanted to know they could count on the validity of the signature , and if no one actually witnessed the action of one individual or of a corporation how could a business put any faith in it ? This of course caused quite a stir and in rapid fashion the courts ruled this signature carried the same validity as if the parties were standing in the room together . With this , the fax became standard operating procedure world - wide . The courts found validity in this method of signature capturing and businesses also felt secure in this method . Quite a leap of faith considering the complications initially caused by fax machines . Many people did n't realize that the original fax paper 's ink would vanish after a period of time and you had to make another copy of the fax using a copier if you wanted to store it permanently . Also many times the quality of the image was poor or barely legible , but businesses understood the intention and would consider it signed even if there was only a partially legible signature . So in essence you had a copy of a copy of a digital image , and even with so many loopholes for alteration and criminal malfeasance the fax still worked and business flourished . The business logic behind this thinking was easily justifiable . Before the fax machine , the contract could have been signed verbally between the sales person and the client , and then somewhere down the road a paper copy would have been signed and mailed . Many sales before the fax machine were consummated with a simple \u201c OK let 's do it \u201d comment over the phone . This drive to get business and make the wheels turn demonstrates the most vital point in an electronic communications based world , or for that matter in a digital world with no physical or direct contact , is most businesses can operate on trust . They provide a service to a customer and the customer trusts they will provide that service in a satisfactory manner , while the service provider trusts that the customer will pay for services rendered . Trust is not a new thing in business ; it was often indicated by a hand - shake or \u201c You have a deal \u201d , and that was all you needed to get a deal done . Has that changed today ? I believe the answer is no , but what about the courts , and their opinion on the validity of the electronic signature ? After all the courts ' goal is not just to keep the wheels turning and generate revenue , so why did they trust this type of signature and what was the legal question this signature answered ? This line of thinking brings us back to Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act ( \u201c ESIGN \u201d ) and the other federal and state guidelines . The Government Paperwork Elimination Act ( \u201c GPEA \u201d ) , Uniform Electronic Transactions Act ( \u201c UETA \u201d ) , sections within the Code of Federal Regulations ( \u201c CFR \u201d ) , as well as the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act ( \u201c ESIGN \u201d ) are all attempts by Congress , federal departments and the states to define the liability and validity of an electronic signature , and help the courts answer the questions about enforceability . So what exactly is an electronic signature ? Here are the definitions from laws important laws and government agencies . ESIGN Act Sec 106 definitions : ( 2 ) ELECTRONIC - The term `electronic ' means relating to technology having electrical , digital , magnetic , wireless , optical , electromagnetic , or similar capabilities . ( 4 ) ELECTRONIC RECORD - The term `electronic record ' means a contract or other record created , generated , sent , communicated , received , or stored by electronic means . ( 5 ) ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE - The term `electronic signature ' means an electronic sound , symbol , or process , attached to or logically associated with a contract or other record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record . GPEA Sec 1710 definitions : ( 1 ) ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE . \u2014 the term \" electronic signature \" means a method of signing an electronic message that \u2014 ( A ) identifies and authenticates a particular person as the source of the electronic message ; and ( B ) indicates such person 's approval of the information contained in the electronic message . UETA Sec 2 definitions : ( 5 ) \" Electronic \" means relating to technology having electrical , digital , magnetic , wireless , optical , electromagnetic , or similar capabilities . ( 6 ) \" Electronic agent \" means a computer program or an electronic or other automated means used independently to initiate an action or respond to electronic records or performances in whole or in part , without review or action by an individual . ( 7 ) \" Electronic record \" means a record created , generated , sent , communicated , received , or stored by electronic means . ( 8 ) \" Electronic signature \" means an electronic sound , symbol , or process attached to or logically associated with a record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record . Federal Reserve 12 CFR 202 definitions : refers to the ESIGN Act Commodity Futures Trading Commission 17 CFR Part 1 Sec. 1.3 definitions : ( tt ) Electronic signature means an electronic sound , symbol , or process attached to or logically associated with a record and executed or adopted by a person with the intent to sign the record . Food and Drug Administration 21 CFR Sec. 11.3 definitions : ( 5 ) Digital signature means an electronic signature based upon cryptographic methods of originator authentication , computed by using a set of rules and a set of parameters such that the identity of the signer and the integrity of the data can be verified . ( 7 ) Electronic signature means a computer data compilation of any symbol or series of symbols executed , adopted , or authorized by an individual to be the legally binding equivalent of the individual 's handwritten signature . These laws and guidelines merely provide for the legality of the electronic signature , and not the specific method or technology . Actually , Congress and the law left it to each of us to determine what method works best for our purpose when implementing an electronic signature capturing system . For example , an electronic signature could be a pen pad device connected to a computer where consumers can sign for products at the checkout counter . But for a business in California , trying to send a contract to Florida , pen pad devices are not practical and therefore the California business may choose a more Internet friendly implementation . It is this openness to technology that not only benefits businesses but also the consumers ; because in trying to comply with Sec. 101.b\/c\/d the business will strive to use a technology that best meets the needs of their specific business and consumers .

But as Peter Daszak , the head of the small non-profit organization \u2014 EcoHealth Alliance in New York City \u2014 found out in early July , the funding ca n't be used unless the organization meets what he says are absurd conditions . The demands , detailed in a letter from the NIH , are politically motivated , he says . To carry out its research , EcoHealth Alliance partners with the Wuhan Institute of Virology ( WIV ) in China , which has been at the centre of unfounded rumours that the COVID - 19 pandemic was caused by a coronavirus released from its laboratory . The NIH cancelled EcoHealth Alliance 's grant in April , days after US President Donald Trump told a reporter that the United States would stop funding work at the WIV . EcoHealth Alliance and Daszak have been working with Shi Zhengli , a virologist at the WIV , for more than 15 years . Since 2014 , an NIH grant has funded EcoHealth 's research in China , which involves collecting faeces and other samples from bats , and blood samples from people at risk of infection from bat-origin viruses . Scientific studies suggest that the SARS - CoV - 2 coronavirus most likely originated in bats , and research on the topic could be crucial to identifying other viruses that might cause future pandemics . The WIV is a subrecipient on the grant . The NIH makes seven demands of EcoHealth ; these were first reported by the Wall Street Journal this week , and have been viewed by Nature . The agency asks EcoHealth to obtain a vial of the SARS - CoV - 2 sample that was used by the WIV to determine the virus 's genetic sequence . It also requests that EcoHealth arranges an inspection of the WIV by US federal officials . Daszak calls the demands from the NIH \u201c heinous \u201d , and worries that the funding freeze is delaying vital work to identify and prevent the next pandemic . The NIH declined to comment , saying that the agency does not disclose internal deliberations on a specific grant . In an e-mail to Nature , Shi calls the NIH 's demands \u201c outrageous \u201d and echoes Daszak 's assertions that the agency 's demands are unrelated to the WIV 's collaboration with EcoHealth . Nature spoke with Daszak about being caught in the political cross-hairs . How have you been doing since your grant was suspended ? It 's just a very difficult and disappointing and worrisome time . I 've lost people that I know to COVID - 19 . It 's a bat-origin coronavirus . We should have been there trying to find out why this thing emerged . And right now I 'm sat in my house , looking out the window , unable to do this work , because the NIH has told us that it 's not appropriate . It 's extremely frustrating . What is the aim of the project that 's been affected ? We have specific aims : to go into rural regions of China to find bat-origin coronaviruses and determine which ones are high risk , then to work with local communities in rural China in five provinces . We target communities that are at high risk for viral ' spillover ' and see whether they 're getting infected \u2014 and then finally see whether people are getting sick from novel coronaviruses . How have you responded to the NIH 's letter ? We 've written to the NIH and said : we think that this is inappropriate and wrong for the following reasons . Please , allow us to continue this work . But I doubt they 're going to do that right now . How do you plan to continue your work ? The NIH have told us not to work on this project . Obviously , we 're not going to break any NIH rules . But we have an ongoing collaboration , we have data that we 've gathered over 15 years of working in China \u2014 5 years under a previous grant from the NIH \u2014 which have n't been published yet . So we need to carry on with that work . How is your work relevant to the pandemic today ? We estimate that every single day , somebody in China or in southeast Asia gets infected with a new bat coronavirus . Right now , somebody is walking around , and they might be developing the first signs of a cough from the next COVID . We fully intend to be an organization that helps to prevent the next pandemic . That is our mission . The NIH has asked you to obtain a vial of isolated SARS - CoV - 2 from the WIV . Did you work on the novel coronavirus during your project ? The grant is n't used to fund work on SARS - CoV - 2 . Our organization has not actually published any data on SARS - CoV - 2 . We work on bat coronaviruses that are out there in the wild and try to predict what the next one is . We do n't work on sequencing SARS - CoV - 2 . It 's absurd because it 's absolutely outside the remit of the work we do . Your grant has received widespread attention in the past few months . How has that been ? Conspiracy - theory outlets and politically motivated organizations have made Freedom of Information Act requests on our grants and all of our letters and e-mails to the NIH . We do n't think it 's fair that we should have to reveal everything we do . When you submit a grant , you put in all your best ideas . We do n't want to hand those over to conspiracy theorists for them to publish and ruin and make a mockery of . What are you most worried about ? We 're not a political organization . We 're just trying to do good work to prevent pandemics . We 're feeling the pressure of a very aggressive administration in the US picking fights with a country where we happen to be collaborating . And it turns out that they decided that this issue and our work is going to be one of the angles of attack . That 's extremely unfortunate . The winner in all of this is the virus , and not just this virus \u2014 SARS - CoV - 2 \u2014 but all the other viruses . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [\"earlier this year\"], \"Place\": [\"the Wuhan Institute of Virology ( WIV ) in China\"], \"Undesirable_location\": [\"from its laboratory\"], \"Escapee\": [\"the SARS - CoV - 2 coronavirus\"]}"}

Protesters outside church in LA Demonstrators marched through Hollywood , blocking traffic and forcing police to intervene after the controversial ' Proposition 8 ' was approved in a referendum . The proposition asked for the Californian constitution to be changed to define marriage as being between one man and one woman . The referendum came just months after the practice was legalised in the state and more than 18,000 same - sex couples tied the knot . The protests mainly passed off peacefully , although a group of about 500 protesters gathered outside the local bureau of media giant CNN , where they banged on the doors and walls . One protester was seen on TV cameras jumping on top of a police car before he was wrestled to the ground and handcuffed by police . The ban , approved by 52.1 % of voters , was hailed by conservative groups as the people 's way of overturning the state Supreme Court 's ruling in May that legalised gay marriage . Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi The result leaves thousands of gay couples in a legal limbo after they rushed to get married in California since June . They include celebrities such as comedienne Ellen DeGeneres , who wed her long - time girlfriend Portia de Rossi , in August , and is understood to be taking legal action arguing that the proposal is unconstitutional . The talk show host said she was \" saddened beyond belief \" by the ruling and said she \" like millions of Americans , felt like we had taken a giant step toward equality \" by electing Barack Obama as president , but with the passage of Proposition 8 , \" we took a giant step away . \" Japanese-American actor George Takei , who played Mr Sulu in Star Trek , married his long - time partner Brad Altman in September . They were the first couple to receive a marriage license in West Hollywood when California began issuing them to gay couples on June 17 and the actor said his marriage would remain valid .

Why do people feel the need to control the lives of those who are different from them ? And why do they feel they have the right to do so ? Posted By : Larry Report This The USA is still riddled with bigots and hypocrites . I 'm disappointed in the people of the state of California for re-banning same - sex marriages . Just when I thought they took one leap forward in voting for President Barack Obama , they take one step back in supporting \u201c Proposition 8 \u201d . If I was a true Christian , I would grow a beard , marry a woman , father many children and abstain from eating pork . I wo n't grow a beard , marry a woman , father children , I eat pork and I do n't believe in a Book that regards me a sinner and doomed to hell . That is why I 'm not a Christian and a hypocrite . Posted By : Armando De Freitas Report This The Constitution is there to afford the same rights and guarantees to all ; majority , minority , believers and non-believers . Gay and Lesbian people do not expect the blessing of a religious group ; we just want the same rights and recognition under the law . Out and proud gay man living in a country which allows gay marriage , South Africa I have no objections if two people of the same gender want to live together and have sex . By concern is about encouraging such a life - style which will surely lead to a drop in numbers of the white race ( notice all the protesters are white ) . And that will mean the end of the white culture as we know it . What will take its place ? Look at the highest rising community in L.A. for example . Hispanic culture . Two people of the same gender having sex is UN - NATURAL . It can only lead to cultural and social disaster for the whites and America in general . As for the stars such Ellen Generate who flaunt this lifestyle , the less said the better . Posted By :eddy Report This There is nothing normal about same sex relationships or marriage no matter how the politically correct posture and blow a gasket . Gay sex is a perversion , and yes as society we have been forced to accept it in many instances , but I am pretty confident that many privately abhor and disagree with it . Posted By :sue Report This The act of becoming married neither infringes upon nor restricts the rights and freedoms of any other person or group . Posted By : Steve D Report This Prohibiting marriage based on a characteristic shared by a group or class of people , however , does infringe upon and restrict the rights and freedoms of that class of people . Prohibiting the marriage of homosexuals is the same as prohibiting the marriage of heterosexuals , or of people of mixed race , or people with blue eyes or those who like football or are less than 5 feet tall . It unfairly abridges the rights and freedoms of a particular class of people , like prohibiting women from voting or blacks from sharing public bathroom facilities with whites . The Constitutional amendment proposed by Proposition 8 has that fundamental flaw which makes it unconstitutional . It wo n't hold up to legal scrutiny and argument . Like all other arbitrarily prejudicial laws , it will be challenged and defeated ; the only question is how soon . Homosexuals and their practices disgust me . It should be made illegal and driven underground again . Perhaps we can the use the expression \" gay \" in its original sense .

At the time , U.S. political and demographic developments were inspiring major changes in attitudes about , and approaches to , higher education . Prior to 1959 , there was just one national college - entrance testing program , a program that focused on identifying the most academically able students for admission to the nation 's selective universities . The remainder of college students were admitted either on the basis of scores earned on entrance exams offered by individual states or colleges or on the basis of family ties . In the late 1950s , large numbers of students were approaching college age and wanted to attend college . Financial aid to students was increasing , and most colleges desired increasing enrollments . It was in this environment that ACT 's founders established The American College Testing Program , Inc. , now known as ACT . ACT 's first testing program , the ACT Assessment , was designed to serve two purposes : As the nation 's view of education evolved to embrace lifelong learning , ACT 's programs and services have similarly grown and evolvedhelping people plan for , and assess , learning and training throughout their lives , while in school or the workplace . As a result , ACT has played an increasingly important role in the nation 's educational enterprise , by contributing to the scope of the nation 's educational vision and delivering programs that support that vision . In late 1996 , we changed our name from American College Testing to ACT ( pronounced In 2002 , we officially acknowledged our growing role in supporting both education and the workforce . A new corporate structure was announced , comprising two divisions : Education and Workforce Development . The new governance structure consists of a 14 - member Board of Directors , and the expanded advising structure retains the ACT State Organizations but now also includes two distinct Advisory Boards , one for each of the new divisions . These changes all undergird our ongoing commitment to providing information for transitions into both education and the world of work . In 2005 , the creation of ACT International , B.V. enabled us to build upon the services we had developed over the past five decades and to extend them to individuals and organizations throughout the world . ACT International has two subsidiaries : The move into the international arena is in close accord with ACT 's mission . ACT is still an independent , not-for- profit organization , dedicated to helping individuals attain their educational and career goals through assessment programs with solid research foundations . \u00a9 2006 by ACT , Inc .

Van Exel had said he would forfeit some of his guaranteed $ 26.5 million over the final two years of his contract , which runs through the 2004 - 05 season \" What I can confirm is accurate is that Nick is not willing to give up what Boston is asking \u2014 guaranteed salary protection for two years , \" said Van Exel 's agent , Scott Botman . \" It 's getting to the point where I 'm doubting whether anything will get done . \" With that door closed , the Celtics made a deal with Phoenix and acquired Rogers , a forward , and Delk , a guard , for rookie Joe Johnson , veterans Randy Brown and Milt Palacio and a Boston 's No. 1 pick in the upcoming draft . The deal gives the Celtics a pair of players who can score from the outside , one of whom , Rogers , also is a muscular addition to Boston 's frontline . Johnson , a rookie from Arkansas selected 10th overall in last June 's draft , had seen his role reduced in recent weeks . The surprising Celtics are in second place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 31 - 23 . They are five games behind the Nets , whose president , Rod Thorn , has acknowledged that the team would like to add another big body . That body could belong to Jackson , who sat out his 16th consecutive game Wednesday as the Warriors played Philadelphia . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Exchangers\": [], \"Themes\": [], \"Place\": [], \"Time\": [\"Wednesday\"], \"Exchanger_1\": [\"the Boston Celtics\"], \"Exchanger_2\": [\"Phoenix\"], \"Theme_2\": [\"Rodney Rogers and Tony Delk\"], \"Theme_1\": [\"rookie Joe Johnson\"]}"}

The operation was implemented according to NKVD Order No. 00485 signed by Nikolai Yezhov . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> As we recall the Red Army 's liberation of Auschwitz on January 27 , 1945 , sixty - six years ago today , we might ask : who was worse , Hitler or Stalin ? In the second half of the twentieth century , Americans were taught to see both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union as the greatest of evils . Hitler was worse , because his regime propagated the unprecedented horror of the Holocaust , the attempt to eradicate an entire people on racial grounds . Yet Stalin was also worse , because his regime killed far , far more people \u2014 tens of millions , it was often claimed \u2014 in the endless wastes of the Gulag . For decades , and even today , this confidence about the difference between the two regimes \u2014 quality versus quantity \u2014 has set the ground rules for the politics of memory . Even historians of the Holocaust generally take for granted that Stalin killed more people than Hitler , thus placing themselves under greater pressure to stress the special character of the Holocaust , since this is what made the Nazi regime worse than the Stalinist one . Discussion of numbers can blunt our sense of the horrific personal character of each killing and the irreducible tragedy of each death . As anyone who has lost a loved one knows , the difference between zero and one is an infinity . Though we have a harder time grasping this , the same is true for the difference between , say , 780,862 and 780,863 \u2014 which happens to be the best estimate of the number of people murdered at Treblinka . Large numbers matter because they are an accumulation of small numbers : that is , precious individual lives . Today , after two decades of access to Eastern European archives , and thanks to the work of German , Russian , Israeli , and other scholars , we can resolve the question of numbers . The total number of noncombatants killed by the Germans \u2014 about 11 million \u2014 is roughly what we had thought . The total number of civilians killed by the Soviets , however , is considerably less than we had believed . We know now that the Germans killed more people than the Soviets did . That said , the issue of quality is more complex than was once thought . Mass murder in the Soviet Union sometimes involved motivations , especially national and ethnic ones , that can be disconcertingly close to Nazi motivations . It turns out that , with the exception of the war years , a very large majority of people who entered the Gulag left alive . Judging from the Soviet records we now have , the number of people who died in the Gulag between 1933 and 1945 , while both Stalin and Hitler were in power , was on the order of a million , perhaps a bit more . The total figure for the entire Stalinist period is likely between two million and three million . The Great Terror and other shooting actions killed no more than a million people , probably a bit less . The largest human catastrophe of Stalinism was the famine of 1930 \u2013 1933 , in which more than five million people starved . Of those who starved , the 3.3 million or so inhabitants of Soviet Ukraine who died in 1932 and 1933 were victims of a deliberate killing policy related to nationality . In early 1930 , Stalin had announced his intention to \u201c liquidate \u201d prosperous peasants ( \u201c kulaks \u201d ) as a class so that the state could control agriculture and use capital extracted from the countryside to build industry . Tens of thousands of people were shot by Soviet state police and hundreds of thousands deported . Those who remained lost their land and often went hungry as the state requisitioned food for export . The first victims of starvation were the nomads of Soviet Kazakhstan , where about 1.3 million people died . The famine spread to Soviet Russia and peaked in Soviet Ukraine . Stalin requisitioned grain in Soviet Ukraine knowing that such a policy would kill millions . Blaming Ukrainians for the failure of his own policy , he ordered a series of measures \u2014 such as sealing the borders of that Soviet republic \u2014 that ensured mass death . In 1937 , as his vision of modernization faltered , Stalin ordered the Great Terror . Because we now have the killing orders and the death quotas , inaccessible so long as the Soviet Union existed , we now know that the number of victims was not in the millions . We also know that , as in the early 1930s , the main victims were the peasants , many of them survivors of hunger and of concentration camps . The highest Soviet authorities ordered 386,798 people shot in the \u201c Kulak Operation \u201d of 1937 \u2013 1938 . The other major \u201c enemies \u201d during these years were people belonging to national minorities who could be associated with states bordering the Soviet Union : some 247,157 Soviet citizens were killed by the NKVD in ethnic shooting actions . Advertisement In the largest of these , the \u201c Polish Operation \u201d that began in August 1937 , 111,091 people accused of espionage for Poland were shot . In all , 682,691 people were killed during the Great Terror , to which might be added a few hundred thousand more Soviet citizens shot in smaller actions . The total figure of civilians deliberately killed under Stalinism , around six million , is of course horribly high . But it is far lower than the estimates of twenty million or more made before we had access to Soviet sources . At the same time , we see that the motives of these killing actions were sometimes far more often national , or even ethnic , than we had assumed . Indeed it was Stalin , not Hitler , who initiated the first ethnic killing campaigns in interwar Europe . Until World War II , Stalin 's regime was by far the more murderous of the two . Nazi Germany began to kill on the Soviet scale only after the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in the summer of 1939 and the joint German - Soviet invasion of Poland that September . About 200,000 Polish civilians were killed between 1939 and 1941 , with each regime responsible for about half of those deaths . This figure includes about 50,000 Polish citizens shot by German security police and soldiers in the fall of 1939 , the 21,892 Polish citizens shot by the Soviet NKVD in the Katyn massacres of spring 1940 , and the 9,817 Polish citizens shot in June 1941 in a hasty NKVD operation after Hitler betrayed Stalin and Germany attacked the USSR . Under cover of the war and the occupation of Poland , the Nazi regime also killed the handicapped and others deemed unfit in a large - scale \u201c euthanasia \u201d program that accounts for 200,000 deaths . It was this policy that brought asphyxiation by carbon monoxide to the fore as a killing technique . Beyond the numbers killed remains the question of intent . Most of the Soviet killing took place in times of peace , and was related more or less distantly to an ideologically - informed vision of modernization . Germany bears the chief responsibility for the war , and killed civilians almost exclusively in connection with the practice of racial imperialism . Germany invaded the Soviet Union with elaborate colonization plans . Thirty million Soviet citizens were to starve , and tens of millions more were to be shot , deported , enslaved , or assimilated . Such plans , though unfulfilled , provided the rationale for the bloodiest occupation in the history of the world . The Germans placed Soviet prisoners of war in starvation camps , where 2.6 million perished from hunger and another half million ( disproportionately Soviet Jews ) were shot . A million Soviet citizens also starved during the siege of Leningrad . In \u201c reprisals \u201d for partisan action , the Germans killed about 700,000 civilians in grotesque mass executions , most of them Belarusians and Poles . At the war 's end the Soviets killed tens of thousands of people in their own \u201c reprisals , \u201d especially in the Baltic states , Belarus , and Ukraine . Some 363,000 German soldiers died in Soviet captivity . Hitler came to power with the intention of eliminating the Jews from Europe ; the war in the east showed that this could be achieved by mass killing . Within weeks of the attack by Germany ( and its Finnish , Romanian , Hungarian , Italian , and other allies ) on the USSR , Germans , with local help , were exterminating entire Jewish communities . By December 1941 , when it appears that Hitler communicated his wish that all Jews be murdered , perhaps a million Jews were already dead in the occupied Soviet Union . Most had been shot over pits , but thousands were asphyxiated in gas vans . From 1942 , carbon monoxide was used at the death factories Che\u0142mno , Be\u0142\u017cec , Sobib\u00f3r , and Treblinka to kill Polish and some other European Jews . As the Holocaust spread to the rest of occupied Europe , other Jews were gassed by hydrogen cyanide at Auschwitz - Birkenau . Overall , the Germans , with much local assistance , deliberately murdered about 5.4 million Jews , roughly 2.6 million by shooting and 2.8 million by gassing ( about a million at Auschwitz , 780,863 at Treblinka , 434,508 at Be\u0142zec , about 180,000 at Sobib\u00f3r , 150,000 at Che\u0142mno , 59,000 at Majdanek , and many of the rest in gas vans in occupied Serbia and the occupied Soviet Union ) . A few hundred thousand more Jews died during deportations to ghettos or of hunger or disease in ghettos . Another 300,000 Jews were murdered by Germany 's ally Romania . Most Holocaust victims had been Polish or Soviet citizens before the war ( 3.2 million and 1 million respectively ) . The Germans also killed more than a hundred thousand Roma . Advertisement All in all , the Germans deliberately killed about 11 million noncombatants , a figure that rises to more than 12 million if foreseeable deaths from deportation , hunger , and sentences in concentration camps are included . For the Soviets during the Stalin period , the analogous figures are approximately six million and nine million . These figures are of course subject to revision , but it is very unlikely that the consensus will change again as radically as it has since the opening of Eastern European archives in the 1990s . Since the Germans killed chiefly in lands that later fell behind the Iron Curtain , access to Eastern European sources has been almost as important to our new understanding of Nazi Germany as it has been to research on the Soviet Union itself . ( The Nazi regime killed approximately 165,000 German Jews . ) Apart from the inacessibilty of archives , why were our earlier assumptions so wrong ? One explanation is the cold war . Our wartime and postwar European alliances , after all , required a certain amount of moral and thus historical flexibility . In 1939 Germany and the Soviet Union were military allies . By the end of 1941 , after the Germans had attacked the Soviet Union and Japan the United States , Moscow in effect had traded Berlin for Washington . By 1949 , the alliances had switched again , with the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany together in NATO , facing off against the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies , including the smaller German Democratic Republic . During the cold war , it was sometimes hard for Americans to see clearly the particular evils of Nazis and Soviets . Hitler had brought about a Holocaust : but Germans were now our allies . Stalin too had killed millions of people : but the some of the worst episodes , taking place as they had before the war , had already been downplayed in wartime US propaganda , when we were on the same side . We formed an alliance with Stalin right at the end of the most murderous years of Stalinism , and then allied with a West German state a few years after the Holocaust . It was perhaps not surprising that in this intellectual environment a certain compromise position about the evils of Hitler and Stalin \u2014 that both , in effect , were worse \u2014 emerged and became the conventional wisdom .

That question preoccupied Dr. Madhukar H. Trivedi , a professor of psychiatry at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas , after several of his patients , all suffering from serious depression , mentioned that they felt happier if they went for a walk . The patients in question were taking the widely prescribed antidepressants known as S.S.R.I. 's , for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors , but not responding fully . They remained , by clinical standards , depressed . Dr. Trivedi and his colleagues began to wonder if adding a formal \u201c dose \u201d of exercise would increase their chances of getting better . Certainly the possibility was worth investigating . Clinical depression , as anyone who has experienced or watched a loved one struggle with the condition knows , can be stubbornly intractable . Even if patients have been taking an antidepressant for months , recovery rates tend to hover below 50 percent . In order to increase the odds of improvement , doctors frequently add a second treatment \u2014 often another drug , like lithium or an antipsychotic \u2014 to the S.S.R.I. regimen at some point , Dr. Trivedi said . Most patients ultimately require at least two concurrent treatments to achieve remission of their depression , he said . Studies have shown that these secondary drug treatments help an additional 20 to 30 percent of depressed patients to improve , but the medications can be expensive and have unpleasant side effects . Which prompted Dr. Trivedi to look to exercise . His investigation joins a growing movement among some physiologists and doctors to consider and study exercise as a formal medicine , with patients given a prescription and their progress monitored , as it would be if they were prescribed a pill . In this case , Dr. Trivedi and his collaborators , who included researchers at the Cooper Institute in Dallas , the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana and other institutions , recruited 126 people with depression who had been using S.S.R.I. 's for a minimum of two months , without achieving remission . None of the patients exercised . Dr. Trivedi and his colleagues divided these volunteers into two groups . One began a gentle aerobic exercise routine , under the tutelage of Cooper Institute researchers , which required them to burn a certain amount of calories per session , depending on their weight . How the subjects expended the energy was up to them . Some walked for about 10 minutes a day , on a treadmill or by strolling around the block , at a pace of three miles an hour . Others chose an equivalent easy cycling workout . The second group was more energetic , walking briskly for about 30 minutes a day at a pace of four miles an hour , or the cycling equivalent , a regimen that meets the current exercise recommendations from the American College of Sports Medicine . Each volunteer exercised for four months , while continuing to take an antidepressant . At the end of that time , according to the study published recently in The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry , 29.5 percent had achieved remission , \u201c which is a very robust result , \u201d Dr. Trivedi said , equal to or better than the remission rates achieved using drugs as a back - up treatment . \u201c I think that our results indicate that exercise is a very valid treatment option \u201d for people whose depression has n't yielded to S.S.R.I. 's , he said . As with most scientific findings , though , there are caveats . One is practical . More patients improved in the group that completed the longer , brisker workouts than in the group assigned the easier exercise , but more of them also dropped out of the study . \u201c We need to find ways to support people 's efforts to exercise , \u201d Dr. Trivedi said . \u201c It 's not going to be enough to casually say , ' Go for a walk . ' \u201d Exercise , if it 's to be medicinal in depression treatments , will have to be monitored , he said , so it ca n't be shrugged off . Even then , many people will not respond . Almost 70 percent of the volunteers in this study did not achieve full remission . Failure rates were particularly high for women with a family history of depression , perhaps as a result of some as yet unknown genetic quirk . And women in that group who did recover were more likely to succeed using the lighter exercise program than the more strenuous routine . Then there is the issue of a control group , whose members would have continued with their S.S.R.I . 's but not exercised . This study did not have one , making interpreting the results tricky , said James A. Blumenthal , a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University who was not involved with this study but who has written extensively about exercise and depression . Perhaps four additional months of S.S.R.I. treatment raised people 's moods , and the exercise was incidental . \u201c Evidence is accumulating that exercise may be an effective treatment for depressed patients who are receptive to exercise as a possible treatment and who are able to safely engage in exercise , \u201d he said . But the evidence is by no means definitive . Still , Dr. Trivedi said , although additional studies certainly are needed , there 's no reason for people with unyielding depression not to talk now with their doctors about exercise as a treatment option . \u201c Side effects are almost nonexistent , \u201d he said , \u201c while you get additional benefits , in terms of improvements in cardiovascular health and reductions in other disease risks , \u201d things antidepressant drugs do not provide . \u201c Plus , \u201d he pointed out , \u201c the cost profile is very favorable . \u201d Exercise , as medicines go , is cheap . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Place\": [], \"Agent\": [\"several of his patients\"]}"}

Once again this victory paved the way for an All - Ireland showdown with Kilkenny on 7 September 1969 , however , the team suffered a setback in the week leading up to the game when midfielder Justin McCarthy <event> broke <\/event> his leg in a motorcycle accident . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Independentie | 10.6\u00b0C Dublin IN the last few days , Justin McCarthy , conscious of impending Thurles and its nuances , may well have drawn on his vast experiences to put his mind at ease . He may have harked back to 1977 when he was coaching Clare and Cork provided the opposition . He drove from his home to Thurles that morning , the same road travelled by thousands of Cork followers . Some spotted him and slagged him off . Many of the Cork hurlers on duty had been team - mates a few years before . In all eyes he was a revolutionary for making the switch and in some a traitor . If he could survive that , then a raw recruit in his early 30s , he can surely manage this afternoon 's emotional challenge . Waterford are not his own blood , like Cork were , but in the seven years he was there he won three Munster titles with them , including the first in 39 years , as well as a league title . Even for a personality like McCarthy , who avoids getting close to players , there are connections and shared experiences not easily overlooked . Furthermore , he meets his old team with the ink scarcely dry on a messy and acrimonious divorce . Neither will want to lose although there are larger issues at stake than the respective egos involved . Does he really need the hassle ? Evidently , yes . McCarthy is 64 years old , though he does n't look or indeed act it -- being still drawn to the ball alley in Rochestown where he has been refining his skills since childhood . Limerick is the fourth Munster county he 's coached in a career that winds back to 1970 when he headed to Antrim to help their hurlers prepare for the All - Ireland intermediate championship . At every port of call he has had success , winning All - Irelands with Cork , league titles with Clare , and the recent gains at Waterford . When he took over Waterford in 2001 , he had n't coached at inter-county level since 1985 and was in his mid-50s . But he enjoyed instant good fortune and quelled doubts that he might have lost touch . McCarthy 's reputation for good coaching had the ideal template in Waterford and the marriage prospered . It began to go stale because of the ongoing failure to win an All - Ireland semi-final -- they lost four in his time , including the most critical to Limerick in 2007 -- which eventually placed unbearable pressure on the relationship . Players had a closer affinity to Gerry Fitzpatrick , the team trainer , and the lack of intimacy between them and McCarthy became an increasing problem . In Limerick , the players have responded well to his coaching and spoken highly of the drills and the constant emphasis on ball work . It is unlikely , however , that they will ever regard him as a wonderful man-manager . McCarthy is a coach in the purest sense and in his appropriately - titled autobiography , Hooked , he states his preference for keeping a distance from players . He does note the importance of close communication through coaching but players often need more invasive personalities , charmers , to get the best out of them . That was never McCarthy 's way and it 's hardly going to change now . How much McCarthy 's coaching ethos can benefit Limerick is questionable . They do not have the same quality presented to McCarthy when he took over Waterford or in his previous spells with Cork and Clare . In his first year in Limerick , he has had to settle into the job and get to know the panel . He was present at the recent championship match between Patrickswell and Kilmallock . It will take time . His first championship team has a couple of newcomers but there are no radical alterations . They did not make much of an impression in the league and were beaten in a few recent challenge matches , although that is never a sound guide . McCarthy will be judged on championship . Former county hurler Stephen McDonagh is n't sure how it will turn out . \" It 's very hard to know . He has a fierce hurling pedigree . He has forgotten what more fellas have learned but having said that , he is inheriting a squad in Limerick that needs an awful lot of work . \" I think it 's about whether Limerick will be able to score enough , do well enough up front . Whether they can put up the 2 - 20s and 3 - 19s . Through the league ( Andrew ) O'Shaughnessy has been very quiet . But in Limerick he is expected to win a match all on his own . \" Ironically , it was Limerick who did much to hasten McCarthy 's departure from Waterford by causing a huge upset in the All -Ireland semi-finals two years ago . On the Thursday before , McCarthy put the players through a 50 - minute match , which some saw as a spontaneous gesture , when they wanted rest . On the previous Sunday , they had beaten Cork in a replayed All - Ireland quarter - final . The Limerick game was their third championship Sunday on the trot . The final year went up in smoke . The players could sense trouble when they went to Portugal on a pre-championship training excursion . Unlike the previous year , when Gerry Fitzpatrick handled most of the sessions , the mood was lifeless . When McCarthy asked the players to present any issues to the management they felt needed examination , he greeted the results dismissively . Two players went to see him and listed off a number of complaints , including a call , it is believed , to have one selector removed . His reaction meant the exercise proved counter - productive . \" He went bananas , \" says one player . When they went home they had a challenge match lined up against Kilkenny . Many of the players expected a beating and a possible heave against the manager . In true enigmatic fashion , they won . One player says McCarthy suffers from \" Glenn Hoddle Syndrome \" -- alluding to the former England soccer international 's fixation , while managing Spurs , with showing off his skills . McCarthy has always held that he is a better coach being able to demonstrate his point in a practical way and he was always a stylish hurler . He hurled until he was 46 after coming back from serious and career - threatening injury . In his book , he told how he wakes up some mornings disappointed after having dreamt he was still hurling for Cork . After seven years with Waterford , the more quirky aspects of McCarthy 's management began to grate . On the Portugal trip last year a training session arranged for 5.30 to allow for cooler temperatures was brought forward to 4.0 by McCarthy at short notice . He then went away for the evening , a player claimed , to indulge in his long - time passion for photography . The Munster championship defeat to Clare , and the visible coolness shown towards McCarthy by Dan Shanahan when taken off , brought matters to a head . The next week the players met and put out the clear signal that they wanted a change of management . McCarthy said that his door was open to discussions but it is claimed that he gave short shrift to one player who was seeking to have his hurl , which McCarthy was to repair , returned . Relations with other parts of the Waterford hurling firmament were also suffering by then . The U21 hurling manager Shane Ahearne had several players on the senior panel but McCarthy would n't respond to his calls . There had been an incident after a match in Ennis a few years before where McCarthy lit on Ahearne for being critical of him and the team in a newspaper column . McCarthy did n't say much about his departure although he did speak to RTE . \" It could have been sorted out , \" he said . \" We had 30 players on the panel -- 15 would be disappointed . On top of that , you would have some key old players who might not get their place . They might not be on the team for Saturday either . \" A long weekend . Maybe a few hasty decisions . No one stood back . I would have loved to discuss it with the players but they said they did n't want to discuss it . I had no option but to resign . I asked the chairman but the players instructed him there would be no discussion so I had no chance of sorting it . \" He described his time in charge of Waterford as an \" overachievement \" . But within a few months of his departure , they had reached an All - Ireland final which he has failed to do in six attempts . In the same RTE interview last year , he added : \" I mean in Cork we never played a game we thought we could n't win . You have to try and impart that on players in Waterford who like to play a good game or maybe do okay . But for me , maybe it was too severe . Maybe I have a one - track mind , only trying to win all the time . I did n't want to come second . I wanted to be first . I tried to push that on players constantly . It does n't always wear well . Some of the older players might n't like it . \" Forty years ago , McCarthy was involved in a serious motorbike accident that ruled him out of the 1969 All - Ireland final , three years after he was named Hurler of the Year when Cork returned to win the McCarthy Cup and end a 12 - year wait . He was never the same player again after breaking his leg and it precipitated his move into coaching . They were so impressed with him in Antrim in the early 1970s that he was offered a full - time coaching role , long before that became fashionable in the GAA . But he declined because of the logistics . \" As a rule , I never get close to a team I train , \" he revealed in Hooked . \" Winning is too important to be compromised by friendships . \" But that attitude is n't for everyone and McCarthy , despite his longevity , success , and the respect he has acquired in the hurling world , is still regarded as an outsider . Some players saw that he is notoriously stubborn in not letting grudges pass . There are plenty of reasons for holding a grudge today , of course , and whether he will be willing to reunite with his old allies in the dressing room , win or lose , afterwards is not known . GAA people tend to pride themselves on being able to shake hands with the rival and their critic and move on . McCarthy 's main priority , however , is to win the match , not to score personal points . \" I think it has been very positive , we all know he has a proven track record , he is one of the best coaches and managers in the country . We hope he will work the Midas touch with Limerick , \" says Ger Hegarty , former Limerick player and minor manage this year . \" I am very optimistic . I know Limerick and they are a championship side and know they will give it 150 per cent on Sunday . The feedback from the players has been very , very positive . \" With McCarthy , anything is possible .

The bombing came just a week after security forces arrested the Indonesian wife -- Istiada Oemar Sovie and her two boys ages six and eight -- of a Jemaah Islamiya militant , Dulmatin , in Jolo island . North Cotabato Provincial Police Chief Federico Dulay said the bomb , believed to be made from an 88 mm mortar shell , went off at about 8 p.m. in front of the town hall of Makilala town in the southern part of the province . \" Clearly this is a terrorist act , \" Dulay said . Another bomb killed two women and injured four others in a public market in Tacurong City , Sultan Kudarat province , as US and Philippine officials said they had received credible intelligence that a terrorist group may be planning to carry out bombings in the southern Mindanao region , where Sovie was captured last week . The US Embassy warned that it had received \" credible information \" about possible attacks , particularly in cities in central Mindanao , \" over the next several days . \" Two Philippine security officials monitoring the area agreed , citing possible retaliation for last week 's arrest of Sovie on southern Jolo Island , in the Mindanao region . Sovie 's husband , Dulmatin , is Asia 's most wanted terror suspect for his alleged role in the 2002 Bali bombings that killed 202 people . Quoting witnesses , Dulay said an unidentified man carrying a plastic bag went to a stall selling alcohol in a crowded area along a highway during celebrations of Makilala 's founding anniversary , bought a bottle of wine , then left . The explosion occurred minutes later , killing a man and a woman on the spot , he said . Ten other people died en route to a hospital in nearby Kidapawan City or while being treated there . Twenty others suffered injuries are still being treated in nearby hospitals . A row of commercial stalls , a carnival and cultural presentations in a nearby gymnasium have attracted crowds this week . The powerful explosion destroyed a row of stalls and two motorcycle taxis and dug a crater in the asphalt road , Dulay said . \" The area is a total wreck , \" Dulay said . Makilala is a small banana and rubber - producing town 950 kilometers ( 590 miles ) southeast of Manila . Communist and Muslim guerrillas are known to have a presence in the town . Earlier in the day , a security guard found the bomb in Tacurong , a predominantly Christian agricultural region not far away . It was stashed in a bag filled with packs of corn chips , and the guard hurled it away from a crowd before it exploded , preventing more casualties , army Colonel Felipe Tabas said . \" We are still investigating the motive of the attack and who was behind it . Two people are dead and four more are wounded in the bombing , \" said Lieutenant Colonel Julieto Ando , spokesman of the Army 's 6th Infantry Division . The bomb also was made from a small mortar round and could be remotely triggered using a cell phone but it apparently went off prematurely after the guard tossed it away , police Chief Superintendent German Doria . Such bombs have been used in the past by the Jemaah Islamiyah and its local ally , the Abu Sayyaf group , but investigators were trying to determine if other groups , like extortion gangs , were involved , Doria said . About 10 security guards were deployed recently at the market because of intelligence reports it could be targeted , he said . The fatalities were identified as Conchita Magon and Isabel Mariano . Those injured were Helen Mendoza , 42 ; Rudy Salada , 22 ; Roselyn Tubilla , 28 ; and Delia Panyoza , 22 . Soldiers and policemen were tracking down two men who were seen near the restrooms minutes before the bomb , fashioned out from an 81 - mm mortar , was detonated . Tacurong City Mayor Lino Montilla condemned the attack . No group has claimed responsibility for the noontime attack . In southern Zamboanga city , police are on alert to safeguard an annual Roman Catholic festival that culminates with a public parade on Thursday . The predominantly Christian city of about 700,000 has been hit by deadly bomb attacks in recent years that were blamed on the Abu Sayyaf . The United States has offered a US$ 10 million reward for the capture of Dulmatin and US$ 1 million for another Indonesian , Umar Patek . The two are believed to be hiding in Jolo with Abu Sayyaf guerrillas . ( With reports from RHB \/ GF of Sun . Star Davao \/ AP \/ Sunnex ) ( October 11 , 2006 issue ) Write letter to the editor .

Whichever way you look at it , however , the administration loses . Of the 136 Saudi detainees originally held as the \" worst of the worst , \" 107 have now been released ( 45 in the last four months alone ) . Removing from these figures the three men who died , this means that just 26 Saudi detainees remain in Guant\u00e1namo . Drawing on the research I conducted for my book The Guant\u00e1namo Files : The Stories of the 774 Detainees in America 's Illegal Prison - and additional information released by the Pentagon just two months ago - I can reveal exclusively that the stories of these men do nothing to bolster the administration 's claims , first voiced nearly six years ago , that those detained in the \" War on Terror \" were so uniquely dangerous that it was worth breaking domestic and international law , shredding the Constitution , abandoning the Geneva Conventions and introducing torture as official US policy to hold them without charge or trial - potentially forever - in conditions that are worse than those endured by the most hardened convicted criminals on the US mainland . Of the 14 men , seven - five humanitarian aid workers and two missionaries - had no connection whatsoever with any kind of militancy . The first of the missionaries , 24 - year old Khalid al - Bawardi , who pompously lectured his tribunal about the finer details of Sunni Islamic practice , explained that he had traveled around Pakistan and Afghanistan hectoring his fellow Muslims for their failings - mainly to do with raised graves and good luck charms - and had been handed over to US forces by opportunistic border guards , after crossing into Pakistan after the US - led invasion began . The second , 26 - year old Sultan al - Uwaydah , did not take part in any of the tribunals or review boards in which , though deprived of legal representation and subject to secret evidence obtained through torture , coercion or bribery , the detainees were at least allowed to present their stories . Looking at the \" evidence \" presented by the administration , however , his explanation for being in Afghanistan - that he traveled to \" teach the Koran to poor and disadvantaged Muslims , \" and that he duly taught the Koran to children in various locations , before hooking up with his uncle in Khost and escaping to Pakistan , where he was arrested - was severely at odds with the authorities ' version . This other scenario included an allegation that he was \" arrested after crossing into Pakistan from Afghanistan with 30 other persons suspected of being Osama bin Laden bodyguards , \" and other allegations , from various sources , including \" a senior al - Qaeda operative , \" that purported to reinforce this notion that he was one of 30 bodyguards for bin Laden . Noticeably , however , it has been established that the bodyguard story was concocted by a fellow detainee , Mohammed al - Qahtani , the alleged \" 20th hijacker \" on 9\/11 , during the four months that he was tortured in Guant\u00e1namo in late 2002 , and it 's difficult , therefore , to lend much credence to all the other unsubstantiated allegations . Of the five humanitarian aid workers , the most complete story was told by 28 - year old Mohammed al - Harbi , whose release was clearly long overdue . A successful grocer in Saudi Arabia , al - Harbi batted away an allegation that he was a mujahideen fighter in Kandahar , insisting that he had never been to Afghanistan , and explaining that he traveled to Pakistan in November 2001 to deliver nearly $ 12,000 to those in need of humanitarian aid . Adding that he was only planning to stay for a few weeks at most , because his wife was pregnant at the time , he proceeded to explain that \" The Pakistani police sold me for money to the Americans , \" even though \" I had a return ticket home and it was clear I was n't planning to stay or ever cross into Afghanistan . \" He added that , although the Saudi authorities intervened to help him while he was in custody in Pakistan , the ISI ( the Pakistani intelligence services ) deliberately hid his passport , presumably to protect the reward money they were receiving from the Americans , who were paying an average of $ 5,000 a head for al - Qaeda and Taliban suspects . The story of the second aid worker , 28 - year old Sa'id al - Shihri , was unknown until the Pentagon released its new batch of documents in September . According to the government 's own \" evidence , \" al- Shihri decided to do charity work in Pakistan after hearing a speech by a sheikh in his local mosque . Twelve days after 9\/11 , he flew to Pakistan , and then \" traveled with an Afghan driver , another Saudi man who worked with the Red Crescent , and a member from the Saudi embassy in Pakistan , \" in a vehicle taking supplies to a refugee camp near the Afghan border between Spin Boldak and Quetta . Wounded in a bombing raid , he was taken to a Red Crescent hospital in Quetta , where he and four others stayed for a month and a half , \" awaiting a plane to come and take them back to Saudi Arabia . However , when they were moved from the hospital they were put on a plane and taken to Kandahar , \" to the US prison at the airport , where al - Shihri stayed for ten days before being flown to Guant\u00e1namo . To counter this detailed and non-military explanation for al - Shihri 's presence on the Afghan border , the authorities managed to come up with nothing more than a few wildly tangential allegations : that he \" trained in urban warfare at the Libyan Camp north of Kabul , \" and , even more improbably , that , according to \" an individual , \" he \" instigated him and another person to assassinate a writer , \" based on a fatwa issued by a radical sheikh . The other three aid workers were involved with the Saudi charity al - Wafa , whose headquarters were in Kabul . Blacklisted two weeks after 9\/11 and regarded as a front for al - Qaeda , dozens of detainees were tarred as terrorists because of their association with the charity , even though humanitarian aid was clearly the main focus of the organization . 27 - year old Zaid al - Husain al- Ghamdi , who traveled to Afghanistan in July 2001 , was declared an \" enemy combatant \" after his tribunal in October 2004 on the basis of three particularly thin allegations : that he was a member of al - Wafa , that he \" carried a weapon in Afghanistan , \" and that he was \" present and wounded during military operations at Khost \" in December 2001 . These allegations were augmented in the years that followed , but nothing about these additional claims suggests that they were reliable . The authorities alleged that he \" was identified \" as the \" occasional leader \" of a group of fighters in the northern city of Taloqan , but ignored another narrative that could be pieced together from other statements : that al - Ghamdi reported that he left home \" to provide help for the refugees in Afghanistan , \" that he worked for al - Wafa as a laborer in Kabul , and that he traveled to Taloqan because , after approaching Taliban representatives in Kabul to find out \" places needing assistance with orphans , \" he had been told that Taloqan was a suitable area . The additional information compiled by the authorities also provided an explanation of the circumstances of his capture , which contradicted the claim that he was \" wounded during military operations . \" After fleeing to Khost , al - Ghamdi said that he \" stopped in the first Taliban center he came to , \" which was subsequently bombed . Injured and \" rendered unconscious , \" he awoke in a hospital in Miram Shah , in Pakistan , where he was arrested and transferred to US custody . The stories of the other two were unknown until this September , because they did not take part in any tribunals or review boards , and the Pentagon had not released any of the \" evidence \" against them . Al - Wafa litters the story of 23 - year old Jabir al - Qahtani , but none of the allegations come close to any evidence of militant activity . By the time of his last administrative review , all the authorities had managed to come up with were allegations that he traveled to Lahore in March 2001 , \" with his travel partly financed by the head of al - Wafa , \" that he worked in a warehouse in Lahore for six months , and that he then moved to a warehouse in Kabul . Captured by the Northern Alliance in November 2001 , he was held for four months before being turned over to US forces . With only one dubious allegation of militancy - that he \" was identified as a fighter who preferred to spend most of his time lounging around [ various ] guest houses \" - the authorities resorted to alleging that he \" depicts ( sic ) many counter - interrogation techniques attributed to al - Qaeda training and consistent with al - Qaeda members , \" and that , in Guant\u00e1namo , he \" was identified as the leader of a cell block , and has issued a fatwa on the United States . \" A more shocking set of allegations was leveled against 35 - year old Abdullah al - Wafi al - Harbi . He told his interrogators that he traveled to Afghanistan via Iran , three weeks after 9\/11 , and that , when he reached the border and told the guards that \" he had come to Afghanistan to assist in humanitarian efforts , \" they \" informed him about a group called al - Wafa and advised him to join the group if he wished to help the poor . \" After two weeks in Kabul - in other words , when the US - led invasion of Afghanistan began - he said that \" he was told by the Afghanis that they had to leave because there was a problem with Arabs , \" and explained that representatives of al - Wafa provided him \" with directions on how to leave Afghanistan . \" He then traveled by taxi , with three other men , to Khost , where they stayed for a month before crossing into Pakistan , where he was arrested . Ranged against this account was a bewildering array of unsubstantiated allegations : that he \" was identified as an experienced fighter who allegedly fought against the Russians in Afghanistan and Bosnia ( sic ) , \" and that various \" sources \" claimed that he attended the Khaldan training camp in Afghanistan , that he was \" well known by clerics and imams in Saudi Arabia as a recruiter and fundraiser for <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Crime_jurisdiction\": [\"the Saudi government\"], \"Current_jurisdiction\": [\"Guant\\u00e1namo\"], \"Authorities\": [\"the US administration\"], \"Place\": [\"US\"], \"Suspect\": [\"14 Saudi detainees\"], \"Time\": [\"Saturday\"]}"}

In the short term , ongoing parent abuse has been found to impact on a parent 's and other family members ' physical and psychological health , with specific negative emotions such as <event> fear <\/event> , shame , guilt and despair commonly reported ( Cottrell & Monk , 2004 ) . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Responding to ' parent abuse ' ' Parent abuse ' \u2013 where an older child causes physical , psychological or financial damage to a parent with the intention of controlling the relationship \u2013 appears to be a hidden yet increasingly prevalent problem . How might it be conceptualised ? What do we know about it ? What do responses to the problem currently look like ? And finally , in what ways might psychology be able to contribute to this underexplored area ? ' He 'll scream and shout at me , awful abuse , absolutely awful abuse , he 'll throw things at me , he 'll punch holes in doors , he 'll threaten to hit me , and this 'll be all in front of my three little ones . ' ( Maddie ) The quote above is taken from a research project that was not intending to explore ' parent abuse ' , but to look at how parents manage children who are involved in ' offending ' . However , in many interviews with mothers and fathers who were talking about life with their teenage sons and daughters , parents told me about these harrowing experiences ( see Holt , 2009 ) . ' Parent abuse ' has been defined by Cottrell ( 2001 , p.3 ) as ' any harmful act of a teenage child intended to gain power and control over a parent . The abuse can physical , psychological , or financial . ' The term is useful in highlighting the abusive dynamic which appears to be at play in Maddie 's and other parents ' experiences , the effects of which have been found to be similar to the effects of other forms of family abuse ( e.g. child abuse and elder abuse ) . However , this term is not without its problems : the term ' parent ' hides the reality that it is most commonly ' mother ' who is the recipient of such abuse . Furthermore , the term ' abuse ' implicitly implies a ' perpetrator ' who is an ' abuser ' and this may not be an appropriate or helpful way of positioning somebody who is under 18 years of age . On the other hand , another frequently used term , child - to - parent violence ( or ' CPV ' ) , is perhaps too narrow , given that we are clearly talking about more than ' violence ' . We are also talking about more than children ' hitting out ' at parents , which in many ways may constitute ' normal ' child \/ teenage behaviour ( although it is debatable whether such normalisation is acceptable and at what point the ' normal ' becomes ' abusive ' ) . Other terms , such as mother abuse , adolescent violence towards parents and youth - to - parent abuse have also been suggested in the literature . But again , they are all somewhat inadequate both in terms of what they over - or under-emphasise and in the binaries of power which they imply . Such difficulties in ' naming ' highlight the complicated nature of the power relations involved in parent abuse . Given their access to economic , political and social capital , it could be persuasively argued that it is the parent who has significant power in this relationship . However , the increasing dominance of a discourse of children 's rights over the past two decades has meant that parents are increasingly feeling that their own parental rights are being subsumed ( Holt , 2011 ; Reece , 2009 ) . Indeed , it may be that any apparent increase in parent abuse is one consequence of the way in which government policy has increasingly framed the parent\u2013child relationship in adversarial terms . The issue is further complicated by the gendered power relations that frequently ( although not always \u2013 see below ) characterise parent abuse : for example , in their observations of restorative justice conferences , Daly and Nancarrow ( 2009 ) found that in many ways ( e.g. tactics of control , its cyclical nature ) son-to - mother abuse mirrors the dynamics involved in adult male - to - female domestic violence within the home . What do we know ? The prevalence of parent abuse is difficult to ascertain . Notwithstanding the definitional problems , neither the police nor the British Crime Survey records such incidents and , in any case , it is likely to be hugely underreported by parents themselves . Furthermore , despite the recognition of parent abuse among practitioners who work with families , there is surprisingly little research that has looked at it within the UK . In 2009 Parentline Plus reported that they received an average of 95 calls to the helpline every month from parents concerned about their child 's verbal and \/ or physical aggression towards them : 91 per cent of the callers were female , with the majority of children aged between 13 and 15 years . More directly , research predominantly from the US , Canada and Oceania has explored parent abuse , and a number of consistent findings have come up . In particular , Kennair and Mellor ( 2007 ) review the literature to suggest that it is predominantly mothers , lone parents and those parents facing significant social and family stressors who are most likely to experience physical , psychological and financial abuse from their children . The children are more likely to be teenage ( or the behaviour is more likely to be identified as ' abusive ' at that point ) and are more likely to have previously witnessed or experienced abuse or violence within the family home . They are also more likely to display significantly higher levels of ' oppositional ' or aggressive behaviour than their peers , with a lack of engagement in school a further correlative factor . However , it appears that social class , ethnicity and the gender of the child is not significant , although Kennair and Mellor ( 2007 ) report some evidence that physical abuse is more prevalent in boys . As mentioned , the effects of experiencing abuse from one 's child can be profound . In the short term , ongoing parent abuse has been found to impact on a parent 's and other family members ' physical and psychological health , with specific negative emotions such as fear , shame , guilt and despair commonly reported ( Cottrell & Monk , 2004 ) . These effects extend to the child in question , who may experience helplessness and isolation , and in the longer term , there are concerns over the ways in which this form of abuse may transfer to other targets or be reproduced by other family members who witness it . A factor that perhaps is unique to this kind of abuse is the ' culture of blame ' , which has intensified over the past decade in relation to parenting . There is much evidence that this cultural climate has shaped both parental and societal responses to the problematic behaviour of children and young people . Furthermore , the introduction of Parenting Orders in 1998 has formalised this culture of blame by making parents ' take responsibility ' for their children 's troublesome behaviour by issuing them with a court order , breaches of which can result in a summary conviction . This wider cultural and policy context may well have contributed to the sense that parents are in some way ' deserving victims ' and who therefore attract less sympathy and support in comparison to others ( e.g. children or elders ) who experience family abuse . Policy and practice responses One of the key features of parent abuse is the way in which the experience is silenced . In writing about parent abuse while in the process of researching other aspects of parenting , both Hunter et al. ( 2010 ) and I myself ( Holt , 2009 ) found parental experiences of stress and isolation , and that it was difficult for parents to articulate and ' name ' the experience ( which in itself is likely to contribute to experiences of stress and isolation ) . Furthermore , families and communities have been found to be unsupportive and in some cases may actively devalue parents ' painful experiences of parent abuse ( Edenborough et al. , 2008 ) . There is currently a lack of acknowledgement of parent abuse within social and public policy , meaning that parent abuse tends to be framed within already existing policy discourses that are ill-fitting for the problem in hand . A ' criminal justice response ' to parent abuse seems to be dominant in the UK , but the prospect of telephoning the police and pressing charges against their child is an option many parents will resist \u2013 not least because the outcome may be their own criminalisation in the form of a Parenting Order . Furthermore , any support that is offered alongside the criminalisation of child or parent is unlikely to be sufficient to adequately deal with the complexities of parent abuse . This is particularly so since youth justice support programmes tend to be offered to parents and children \/ young people separately , with little interaction between the two ( Youth Justice Board , 2010 ) . Other agencies , such as domestic violence agencies or child protection departments within social services , may be sources of support , but again there are likely to be complexities when dealing with children ( and adults ) who may be seen as both ' victims ' and ' victimisers ' , making both options problematic ( particularly as the agencies are likely to be already overwhelmed in responding to their own particular form of family abuse ) . Perhaps the most fruitful area for intervention work then is at the local level , where a number of different support agencies can focus specifically on ' parent abuse ' within its own community and structural context . One recent positive example is Brighton and Hove 's Break 4 Change programme , which combined the efforts of the local Youth Offending Team , the Targeted Youth Support Service , Rise ( a local domestic violence support service ) , the Family Intervention Project and support from Brighton Community CAMHS . The pilot support programme involved two parallel weekly sessions running for eight weeks \u2013 one for parents and one for young people aged 11\u201316 years . The programme was underpinned by a brief solution - focused therapeutic approach , and participants explored feelings of anger , blame and isolation , as well as strategies for change , including assertiveness , boundary - making , beliefs and self - care . Evaluation of the pilot programme found that it was successful in initiating change , with parents reporting a reduction in violence and isolation , and young people reporting increased empathy , reduced violence and increased satisfaction at home ( Munday , 2009 ) . Although it is yet unclear whether such changes can be maintained over the longer term , Break 4 Change is an inspiring case study which suggests that a non-punitive , multi-agency , whole - family approach is where thinking and practice should be heading . A role for psychology Clearly , new perspectives are required to help us to understand this troubling social problem . After all , if academics struggle to articulate and respond to the phenomenon , then one wonders how parents are able to do so \u2013 particularly those parents who are already facing multiple disadvantages and stressors . So , how might psychology help ? Three specific suggestions come to mind . Firstly , there is a need for new theoretical frameworks to enable us to conceptualise and understand ' parent abuse ' adequately \u2013 something that is yet to be achieved . This will require further research to highlight the intricacies of what is at play at an individual level , at a familial level and at a structural level , and a transdisciplinary approach may be the best way of teasing out how these levels intertwine . Such an approach is currently lacking : as in practice responses to parent abuse , there appears to be an over- preponderance of research and theoretical thinking at the criminological level . While useful , this risks inevitably constraining theoretical frameworks . I would argue that psychology , as a discipline that does not take a ' topic ' as its focus ( as criminology , social work and youth studies arguably do ) , is better placed <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Topic\": [], \"Expressor\": [], \"Time\": [], \"Stimulus\": [\"ongoing parent abuse\"], \"Experiencer\": [\"a parent 's and other family members '\"], \"State\": [\"negative emotions\"]}"}

The 30 - year-old has been given all the available information to make his decision and at this stage is holding off getting the jab , but he is not required to return to the club for senior training until December 6 . The Blues could then keep him on their list , place him on their inactive list or , eventually , seek to terminate his contract with the club after May 18 if he remained unvaccinated . Carlton refused to comment on his status , and his manager Shane Casley told The Age he had no comment . Jones has been a key player for the Blues in recent seasons and will form part of a solid backline under new coach Michael Voss if he chooses to be vaccinated as the club looks to regain a spot in the finals after a massive upheaval at the end of the season . The AFL said in October it expected only a handful of players to be directly affected by the vaccination policy . Meanwhile , the AFL will tell clubs if any draft nominees do not intend to become fully vaccinated for COVID - 19 before they make their selections in this year 's national draft , in order to guard against players being added to a list who are n't eligible to play or train due to the league 's vaccination policy . Players who have nominated for the draft were told in a letter sent this week that they must inform the league before this Friday , November 12 , if they either wo n't agree to be vaccinated , or will be applying for a medical exemption . If a draft nominee does not inform the leaguethat they do not intend to be fully vaccinated , or consider themselves medically exempt and are subsequently drafted , they may be subject to a sanction under AFL rules . The AFL has also offered support and wellbeing advice to any potential draftee who has concerns about the vaccination policy . Draft nominees who are fully vaccinated , or intend to become fully vaccinated , do not have to inform the AFL of their status , and clubs have been allowed to ask potential draftees whether they had any issues with being vaccinated during their interview process . With Victoria requiring all authorised workers to be fully vaccinated by November 26 , and the national draft occurring on November 24 and 25 , the players have been told there is a chance they will not be able to immediately train with their clubs . Any player drafted to a Victorian club will need to be fully vaccinated to start training immediately after the draft , while those drafted to clubs based in NSW will have until December 17 to be fully vaccinated . Those drafted to clubs based in Queensland , South Australia , and Western Australia will have until February 18 to be fully vaccinated . Keep up to date with the best AFL coverage in the country .

One of the most celebrated is that of the James Ossuary , when information came to light in 2002 regarding the discovery of an ossuary , with an inscription that translated to \" Jacob , son of Joseph and brother of Jesus \" . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Hundreds of biblical artefacts in museums all over the world could be fakes , it has emerged after Israeli investigators uncovered what they claim is a sophisticated forgery ring . Four men have been charged with the faking of some of the most important biblical discoveries in recent years . The artefacts in question include an ossuary which was believed to contain the bones of James , the brother of Jesus , and a tablet with a written inscription by a Jewish king in the ninth century before Christ . The indictment against the men in Jerusalem says : \" During the last 20 years many archaeological items were sold , or an attempt was made to sell them , in Israel and in the world , that were not actually antiques . These items , many of them of great scientific , religious , sentimental , political and economic value , were created specifically with intent to defraud . \" The forgers not only conned buyers out of of millions of dollars , said officials of the Israel Antiquities Authority , but also damaged the science of archaeology , casting doubt on the authenticity of every artefact not uncovered in an authorised dig . Doubts about the artefacts emerged after Israeli police began to hear rumours of an Egyptian craftsman living in Israel who would boast of his part in the forgeries while drinking in Tel Aviv . Detectives launched an investigation two years ago which rapidly became a global exercise . The indictment lists 124 witnesses , including antiquities collectors , archaeologists , officials from Sotheby 's auction house and representatives of the British Museum and the Brooklyn Museum . The forgers were accused of using an authentic artefact and then adding an inscription . They would then add a coating to emulate the grime that accumulated over centuries . The fakes fooled experts for years and the virtually worthless artefacts were grossly multiplied in value . The four men indicted are a Tel Aviv collector , Oded Golan , owner of the James ossuary and the Yoash tablet ; Robert Deutsch , an inscriptions expert who teaches at Haifa University ; Shlomo Cohen , a collector , and Faiz al - Amaleh , an antiquities dealer . Mr Golan said in a statement on Wednesday that \" there is not one grain of truth in the fantastic allegations related to me \" , and that the investigation was aimed at \" destroying collecting and trade in antiquities in Israel \" . Mr Deutsch dismissed the indictment as \" ridiculous \" . Shuka Dorfman , head of the Israel Antiquities Authority , said the forgery ring had been operating for more than 20 years and had been \" trying to change history \" . Scholars said the forgers were exploiting the deep emotional need of Jews and Christians to find physical evidence to reinforce their faith . \" This does not discredit the profession . It discredits unscrupulous dealers and collectors , \" said Eric Myers , an archaeology professor at Duke University in North Carolina . Other forgeries included an ivory pomegranate which scholars believed was the only remaining artefact from King Solomon 's Temple . The James ossuary , with the inscription \" James , son of Joseph , brother of Jesus \" , was thought to be the only physical link in existence today to the life of Jesus 2000 years ago . Shaul Naim , of the Israeli police , said : \" We have reason to believe that many more forged antiquities which we have n't uncovered yet are being held by private collectors in Israel and abroad , and in museums in Israel and abroad . \" Shimon Gibson , an Israeli archaeologist , said museums should review items of questionable origin . \" Now it looks like we are going to have to go backward and double - check all our facts to make sure that what we thought was real really is . \" <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Standard\": [\"biblical artefacts\"], \"Forgery\": [\"fakes\"], \"Agent\": [\"Four men\"], \"Time\": [\"in recent years\"], \"Place\": [\"in Jerusalem\"]}"}

Chan 's brother Michael revealed the bittersweet news after returning from Nusakambangan prison on Monday . \" Feby and Andrew had a celebration this evening , \" Michael said . \" It 's tough times but it 's happy times at the same time . \" He said Andrew and Feby , as she is known , celebrated in Besi prison with family and friends . Michael said the family would like to celebrate with them again on Tuesday . \" Hopefully the president will still show some compassion so these young people can continue with their lives . \" Late on Monday it was revealed Indonesia 's Constitutional Court agreed to consider a last-ditch legal challenge to the country 's clemency laws on May 12 . However Attorney General spokesman Tony Spontana said the Indonesian government would not wait for the Constitutional Court 's decision . \" It is not directly related to their case , \" he said . Lawyers for Chan and Myuran Sukumaran and Indonesian human rights groups asked the court to clarify the president 's obligations when considering clemency pleas . However the Constitutional Court is not an appeal court and it has no power to alter the death sentences of the Australians or make any ruling on their case , Any ruling made by the Constitutional Court would not be retrospective and the Attorney - General has previously stressed the case would not prevent the executions from proceeding . Chan asked Feby to marry him in Bali 's Kerobokan jail , where they met through a mutual friend . Feby , who is an Indonesian pastor , regularly went to the jail as part of her outreach work . Attorney General H.M. Prasetyo said at first he did n't believe the marriage request . \" There was a wish from Andrew Chan , which I thought was n't serious and was n't the last wish , but it turned out to be serious . He wanted to be tied in matrimony with his girlfriend , \" Mr Prasetyo told detik.com . \" He 's been in isolation so I thought he was n't serious . \" He eventually granted the request . The wedding was officiated by family friend and Salvation Army minister David Soper . Chan has also asked Mr Soper to be his religious adviser in his final hours and witness his execution . The families have been told they will have to say their final farewells at about 2 pm on Tuesday . Nine prisoners , including Chan and fellow Bali nine organizer Myuran Sukumaran , are expected to be executed shortly after midnight . Sukumaran 's brother , Chinthu , said he had spent the last five years watching young children play with their parents . \" And I ask the president not to make orphans out of children , Widows .... \" He said . \" There are family members crying inside the prison as we count down the hours . \" Father Charles Burrows has been here before . Seven years ago the Cilacap priest witnessed the execution of two Nigerian heroin smugglers on Nusakambangan . It took the men up to eight minutes to die and while they moaned he sang \" Amazing Grace \" . This time Father Charles will attend the execution of Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte , who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia . \" I 'm dead against the death penalty , \" he said after visiting Gularte . \" The fifth commandment is thou shalt not kill . It 's disgusting they are going to do that . No human being has the right to take another 's life . \" Father Charles said the reaction to the mass executions would be bad for Indonesia and its people . He said polling , which typically finds about 70 per cent of the population supports capital punishment , was done in the cities not the villages . \" I work in villages and everywhere I go no villages have agreed with the death penalty , \" he said . Father Charles said all those on death row and their families were feeling sad and angry . Asked how he felt about witnessing yet another execution , Father Charles said : \" I 'm happy to be accompanying Rodrigo because I 've been with him for seven or eight years . I 'm happy to be with him until the end . \" <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Partner_1\": [\"Andrew Chan\"], \"Partner_2\": [\"Febyanti Herewila\"], \"Place\": [\"on execution island\"], \"Time\": [\"on Monday\"], \"Partners\": [\"Feby and Andrew\"]}"}

They now number about over two million people and live in a 404 - square - mile ( 1,050 \u00c2 k m2 ) homeland which they also refer to as Ogoni , or Ogoniland . They share common oil - related environmental problems with the Ijaw people of Niger Delta . The Ogoni rose to international attention after a massive public protest campaign against Shell Oil , led by the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People ( MOSOP ) , which is also a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization ( UNPO ) . The territory is located in Rivers State on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea , east of the city of Port Harcourt . It extends across the Local Government Areas ( LGAs ) of Khana , Gokana , Eleme and Tai . Traditionally , Ogoniland was divided into the six kingdoms : Babbe , Gokana , Ken - Khana , Nyo - Khana , Eleme and Tai. Nyo - Khana is on the East while Ken-Khana is on the west . The Ogoni people speak Ogoni languages , or Kegboid languages . According to Roger Blench \" Ogoni languages are considered to be part of Cross River , which in turn is part of Benue - Congo and then Niger -Congo . \" The Ogoni of River States speak the related , mutually intelligible languages of Khana , Gokana , Tae ( T\u00e1\u00ba\u00b9\u00e1\u00ba\u00b9 ) , Eleme , and Ban Ogoi . They fall into two clusters , with a limited degree of mutual intelligibility between members of each cluster . However , the Ogoni think of them as separate languages . The Eastern languages are Khana and T\u00e1\u00ba\u00b9\u00e1\u00ba\u00b9 , with a quarter million or so speakers , and Gokana , with about half that number . The Western languages are Eleme , with about 70,000 speakers , and Baan , with about a tenth that number . Ogoni language has drawn some attention from general linguists ; Hyman ( 1983 ) used examples from Gokana in developing his theories of the syllable . More recently , Bond and Anderson ( 2003 ) have compared logophoricity in the ' Ogonoid ' lects . Most striking , however is the presence of a series of numeral classifiers . Typical of many Asian language families , these are extremely rare in Africa , and their evolution therefore typologically extremely unusual . This monograph has two predecessors . Ikoro ( 1991 ) reconstructed ' Kegboid ' [ a name constructed from the initials of the four languages ( Kana , Eleme , Gokana , Baan ) at the time considered to be part of the group . V\u00e1 \u00bb bnu ( 2001 ) is not a reconstruction , but provides some valuable information on each dialect and a short comparative word list ( partially tone marked ) . V\u00e1 \u00bb bnu ( op. cit. ) also includes some cultural background and information on orthographic systems . According to oral tradition , the Ogoni people migrated from ancient Ghana down to the Atlantic coast eventually making their way over to the eastern Niger Delta . Linguistic calculations done by Kay Williamson place the Ogoni in the Niger Delta since before 15 BC , making them one of the oldest settlers in the eastern Niger Delta region . Radiocarbon dating taken from sites around Ogoniland and the neighboring communities oral traditions also support this claim . Traditionally , the Ogoni are agricultural , also known for livestock herding , fishing , salt and palm oil cultivation and trade . Like many peoples on the Guinea coast , the Ogoni have an internal political structure subject to community - by- community arrangement , including appointment of chiefs and community development bodies , some recognized by government and others not . They survived the period of the slave trade in relative isolation , and did not lose any of their members to enslavement . After Nigeria was colonized by the British in 1885 , British soldiers arrived in Ogoni by 1901 . Major resistance to their presence continued through 1914 . The Ogoni were integrated into a succession of economic systems at a pace that was extremely rapid and exacted a great toll from them . At the turn of the twentieth century , \u201c the world to them did not extend beyond the next three or four villages , \u201d but that soon changed . Ken Saro-Wiwa , the late president of MOSOP , described the transition this way : \u201c if you then think that within the space of seventy years they were struck by the combined forces of modernity , colonialism , the money economy , indigenous colonialism and then the Nigerian Civil War , and that they had to adjust to these forces without adequate preparation or direction , you will appreciate the bafflement of the Ogoni people and the subsequent confusion engendered in the society . \u201d The Ogoni are an agricultural and fishing society . Yam and cassava farming are important ways of making a living , although the revenues of these products are not very high . The most important export product of Nigeria is oil , but the Ogoni people have never profited from these exports . Once the ' food basket ' for the Niger Delta and beyond , Ogoniland 's agricultural production has now been severely reduced . This is partly due to loss of farmlands through oil polution and partly to soil fertility problems arising from acid \/ alkaline rain caused by gas flaring . Large areas of fresh and salt water resources as fishing grounds have also been rendered useless by oil spills . Food is becoming increasingly expensive and potential farmers are too poor to pay for seeds and labour . Poverty has worsened in the Ogoni areas during the last years . Nearly all oil workers are people coming from outside the area whom the local people have had to compete with for basic commodities . Besides the oil installations and refineries there are no manufacturing industries in Ogoni to reduce unemployment . This situation increasingly results in psycho-social degradation . There are no government projects to address the problems of development in Ogoni-land . Health facilities are almost non-existent and school buildings are collapsing with the classrooms and laboratories empty . Attracting foreign aid to Ogoni-land has been difficult and a couple of community self - help initiatives by the people were branded ' MOSOP - inspired ' and stopped . Ogoni-land is in total economic isolation by the government and most roads have been left to wear , making transportation extremely difficult . The environmental costs of the oil exploration have been and still are , very high . The agricultural and fishing communities experienced huge oil spills and pollution of drinking water , fishing grounds and farmlands . Large flares burnt gas from the oil extraction process , illuminating the sky day and night and polluting the air . The 1970 's brought increasing activity from the oil companies , claiming more space in an already crowded territory , and resulting in a deteriorating environment and in decreasing crop yields and fish catches . The Ogoni people believe and worship a Supreme Deity and creator called Waa Bari . Ogoni people regards Waa Bari as a female God . Her role and position stems from traditional thinking about creativity and motherhood . According to Paul Bedey : \" \u00e2\u00a6 the Ogoni people have the implicit belief that this female creator resides in the earth and that man and all animals and plants are created out of the earth . All libations and incarnation to Waa Bari are poured on the earth and it is believed she receives it as the wine or water sinks down into the earth . The dead are buried in the earth to return to Waa Bari Ogoni from where they come . It is clear in the traditional belief of the people that Waa Bari Ogoni is omnipotent and omniscient . \" The land on which they live and the rivers that surround them are very important to the Ogoni people . They not only provided enough food , they are also believed to be a god and are worshiped as such . This explains why the Ogoni people have so many difficulties with the degradation of the environment as a result of oil pollution . The fruit of the land , especially yams , are honoured in festivals . The annual festival of the Ogoni people is held during the period of the yam harvest . The planting season is not just a period of agricultural activity , but it is a spiritual , religious and social occasion . ' Tradition ' in Ogoni means in the local tongue ( doonu kuneke ) the honouring of the land . The Ogoni people believe that the soul of every human being has the ability to leave its human form and enter into that of an animal , taking on the shape of that animal . These characteristics show that nature is very important for the Ogoni people . Socially , the Ogoni is endowed with a large variety of cultural practices . These include masks and masquerades , human figure representation of the ancestors , as maybe used in Ka-elu performances and the puppet shows which are performed exclusively by the Amanikpo Society . Majority of these cultural performances in this relatively small region are extraordinarily varied . Most if not all , Ogoni villages have their own festivals , some of long standing , others introduced within living memory . The festivals are mainly held to commemorate the founding of the villages , to pay allegiance to particular ancestral land or water spirits , to mark the planting and harvesting seasons , for the fertility deity , to recognize the taking of titles , to restore peace in troubled community , to maintain cohesion within social groupings and for general entertainment . The Karikpo Mask \/ Masquerade Of all their known festivals and masquerades , the mask style for which the Ogoni are probably most renowned is the one called Karikpo . The Marikpo mask represents animals and is worn on the front of the face by men and boys . It is used for vigorous acrobatic play , performed originally during planting and harvesting seasons for fertility , new yam festivals , and burial ceremonies of members and recently for Christmas and New year celebrations , including reception for a distinguished guest or an illustrious son . The masquerade Performance is believed , especially in Khana to have originated in a certain community known as Bien - Gwara . Although there may not be substantial proof to this , but it is believed the community 's interaction with the Ibibios of Akwa Ibom State , where Ekpo mask has its provenance , may have influenced its adaptation and modification hence its name Kari ( Carved ) Kpo ( Ekpo ) . Membership into the Karikpo Society does not require an elaborate ritual or initiation , but an intending member is made to provide items like a bottle of gin , palm wine , a plate of oiled fish . These would be eaten by the members who then accepts him as one of them . The Ogoni people have been victims of human rights violations for many years . In 1956 , four years before Nigerian Independence , Royal Dutch \/ Shell , in collaboration with the British government , found a commercially viable oil field on the Niger Delta and began oil production in 1958 . In a 15 - year period from 1976 to 1991 there were reportedly 2,976 oil spills of about 2.1 million barrels of oil in Ogoniland , accounting for about 40 % of the total oil spills of the Royal Dutch \/ Shell company worldwide .

Gamasutra spoke to Barel about the Z-Cam , which the company is aiming to release in the second half of 2008 for as yet un - revealed platforms , and he explained how the camera might work for development , synchronize with games , and change the way players interact with them . Can you give me a picture of what differentiates this camera from some of the other pointing and sensing peripherals that have already been released on the market ? Tomer Barel : From a purely technical point of view , in any pointing device that you have , you have one , two -- or as many pointing devices as that might have -- points in space . You can add some information about that , but still these are points in space . What you have here is complete coverage of the whole field of view of the camera , in terms of depth information , or distance information . So it 's the difference between one or two points , to the whole area . And this allows you to really have control of games with however is fit , or most natural , to control the game . So this is real natural input , while , if you think about it , doing boxing with these two pointers in your hands is unnatural . It 's more natural than using a traditional controller , that 's true , but it 's unnatural still . And the way people play boxing , as I said earlier , demonstrates that . When you have full coverage of the whole field of view , either of your whole body , or whatever part of the body you want to use , you can be much more natural . And you talked about how this sends its own light pulses forward from the sensor array on the camera , so it 's not reliant on the lighting , and since it does depth , it 's not reliant on the background ; can you talk a little bit about that ? TB : So , if you compare this to standard 2D cameras , the way this works involves transmitting active illumination . That solves the light problem -- which is a big problem with 2D cameras , and the Eye Toy , or Microsoft Vision . That , obviously , not because they 're not good cameras , they are good cameras , good technologies , but there are limitations to what you can do without light with 2D . Here , you have you have your own illumination source , that enables you to work in any lighting conditions , including complete darkness -- there 's no problem with that . That 's one thing , the other thing that makes many people critical about 2D cameras is the background issues . And again , in 2D you cannot really separate your mother in the background from yourself . Because it does n't understand that one is the gamer and the other is someone that has nothing to do with it . Here , based on distance , you can decide to open a window , or just refer to a certain area , and have like a wall behind that area , and ignore everything else . So you can have a wall , a kind of a virtual wall around the player , and ignore whatever is in the background . That 's another big advantage of these 2D cameras . I would say another thing that is , I think , even more important than the other two things that I mentioned , comparing to other 2D cameras , and that is the fact that -- it 's not only when the background is far apart , it 's also your own background , or your own body . You cannot detect gestures that are in front of the body . If you think about all the games you 're playing with cameras that are 2D , they 're always motion to the side . And that is very unnatural , because we do not do a lot -- if you think of our day- to - day lives -- we do not do a lot of things to the side . We do not do like this [ gestures like someone playing EyeToy . ] We interact to the front . That 's almost impossible to detect with 2D information ; that 's very easy to detect with 3D information . Even if it 's not big movement . It could be static , still something , anything , is detectable because of the depth information . One thing that you showed me was a current application to drop out the background and replace it with video , with the implication that it could be used with games that immersively take place around you . Could you talk about that a little bit ? TB : We have here two complementing capabilities : One is the ability to recognize gestures -- that I was talking about -- and the other , also based on the depth information , the capability to replace background . Because as I said , you can ignore the background , and if you can ignore it , you can easily replace it . We do that real-time , sixty frames per second . You just replace it with whatever you want . The combination is that you can put yourself in a virtual environment , or the game environment , and control the game with gestures . So actually for game design , you have two options : One is to control games by gestures and be represented either as an avatar instead of you , or in a first - person , kind - of have your hands or whatever , kind - of virtual hands , without the concept of your own image ; and the alternative is to have your own image in the game , as you see in some of the Eye Toy games , but also use the control of gestures when you are in the game . We can see a lot of potential for that in social networking -- anything that is online -- have yourself in the game . Not all gamers would like that , but in some situations , that 's relevant for social networking , for MMOs , etc . You were showing me the detection , and it seemed like it could detect five fingers and your palm pretty easily ; is that , would you say , an accurate representation of what its capabilities are , presently ? TB : I also showed you the full skeleton . It can recognize whatever ... But I mean in terms of ' number of points ' . TB : It could generate any number of points . I mean , the thing to understand is : What the camera generates is the depth information . After you have the depth information , you decide what image processing algorithms to use to analyze this data . So if you invest a lot in algorithms , you can have fifty points on your body , and generate , and recognize your head , your palms , your elbow , your shoulders , your feet ; whatever you want . It 's just a matter of what you need , and what you invest in terms of processing . We are working , as a service to developers ' community , on recognizing skeleton tracking . At the moment , we already have it recognizing the head , the two palms , and the torso ; and on recognizing fingers , because we believe that this is the basis of developing further things . But , based on the application , if the application requires recognizing any other point on the body , there is no problem doing that . Investing in a process to do that . What kind of resolution does a version that could go to market generate ? What resolution image is it ? TB : Well , we have n't made a decision about the concrete specs of the camera that will go to the market . I can say that this camera that you see here , the Z-Cam , has an X -Y resolution of 320 by 240 , and that 's definitely enough to recognize fingers , as you could see . That 's in X - Y , and in depth , it has a resolution of 1 centimeter or more . Now there is a big advantage to the technology here , because you can open a window around yourself , and then the resolution spreads across a smaller area . So , the 256 variables spread across the resolution that is high like you need . If you are not interested in the whole range of the camera , you can limit yourself to around the gamer , and get better resolution , in terms of depth . I see . So if you limit it from the perspective of the depth that you pick , the movement control could be finer , basically . TB : Yes. Exactly . And about how far back could you potentially go from the camera , and still have it be an effective input method ? Is that something you 've tested ? TB : This prototype has a range of half a meter to three meters , or ten feet . And this is because this is what we seem to need for livingroom applications . The technology we have used in previous versions has been used up to a hundred meters . So , there is no real limit ; you just need much more light , and that will make it much more costly to buy . It 's just a matter of what you want it for , and we do n't want you to pay for things that you do n't need the camera for . So this is why we limit ourselves to three meters . And , speaking of costs , you talked about why you 're not nailing down the cost of a potential production version yet . You think it will be in a comfortable range for mainstream applications . Could you talk about where you see that right now ? TB : Well , first of all , the camera will not be released rendered as a 3DV camera , so we will have a partner working with us -- obviously , a \" bigger partner \" could be a publisher bundling a game with this , it could be one of the first parties , it could be a hardware player of any other sort . I guess , any pricing decision will be made together . But what I can say in terms of the cost is , as you said , it will be comfortably in the zone that is relevant for peripherals in the gaming arena , and it will be definitely possible to sell it as a bundle for the kind - of $ 69.99 price point that one can feel comfortable about . Or , sell it together with any webcam that is on the shelves in Best Buy or Fry's . Similar price-point . So it 's definitely comparable to the PlayStation Eye , or even just to , say , a Guitar Hero controller , potentially . TB : Oh , the Guitar Hero controller is much more expensive . Although , if you think about Rock Band -- people who say that you cannot charge for peripherals should open their eyes and see what 's happening with Rock Band , and how many units they 've sold . This will be definitely cheaper than Rock Band .

So he could n't eat , \u201d he says . \u201c But I do n't want the Midas touch . I have the Midas touch , in the way that when I hook up with a project , I feel , not speaking cocky or conceited , but there 's a confidence I have . I learned that from Muhammad Ali , I used to bodyguard him . He taught me about confidence . So when it comes to any job I work , I 'm gonna do it good , I 'm going to bring it over the top . \u201d Mr. T's latest venture is certainly over the top . He has signed on as the spokesman for Gold Promise , a new gold - buying venture launched by publicly - traded Cash America , one of the world 's largest pawn brokers . Starting this week , Mr. T will appear in a series of television ads where he tries new things \u2014 playing golf , getting a spa treatment \u2014 a product , the story goes , of him selling a few excess chains . In the campaign , which also features a range of print and web ads , Mr. T exhorts customers to take their unwanted gold , drop it in a special envelope , and mail it to Gold Promise in exchange for cash . \u201c Getting a great price was important to me , \u201d he says in the television spots . \u201c That 's why I chose Gold Promise , a company I trust . \u201d ( Read on : The Softer Side of Mr. T ) So is it wise to sell your stray gold to the company trusted by Mr. T ? Not necessarily . Although Gold Promise boasts that it will beat any competitor 's price by 200 % , it 's important to note that the guarantee only extends to online competitors , which are notoriously shady . A recent study by The Today Show found that online dealers offered as much as little as 8 cents on the dollar for gold jewelry . Most fell in the 50 - 80 cents - on - the - dollar range . Local pawn shops will give you a quote over the phone if you tell them how many karats , and how heavy , your item is . Gold Promise refused such a request , explaining that doing so would \u201c offer the competition the opportunity to adjust their pricing strategy in the short - term to attempt to drive us out of this business . \u201d According to chief executive Dan Feehan , Cash America 's gross margin on scrap gold is 20 % - 25 % , which suggests Gold Promise pays about 80 cents on the dollar for gold , placing it at the high end of the online gold - buying spectrum . Though Gold Promise may be among the better options for selling gold online , most professionals recommend having jewelry appraised before plopping it in an envelope and shipping it away . \u201c This may be a great time to sell unwanted gold jewelry , as the price of gold has shot up over the past few years due to the economic crisis , \u201d says Mary A. Malgoire , president of The Family Firm , a financial advisory in Bethesda , Md . \u201c But do n't jump at the first offer . Get quotes from several local jewelers . \u201d Even though online buyers usually pay less for gold than their bricks - and - mortar counterparts , many consumers are considering buyers like Cash America 's Gold Promise in the wake of the contraction in consumer credit . \u201c Customers that have not traditionally been our customers are looking for new options for small short - term loans since credit limits on cards have been reduced or eliminated , \u201d says Feehan . \u201c They 're looking online \u2026 it 's a lot less intimidating than walking into a pawn shop . \u201d Feehan believes Mr. T will help drum up new customers for his company , which enjoys healthy margins on gold regardless of price fluctuations . But regular investors thinking of sinking more cash into precious metals would be wise to note Mr. T 's presence as a sign of frothy gold prices . \u201c Gold is a poor investment because the return is based solely on price appreciation and , more often than not , fear , rather than sound fundamentals in the demand for the metal , \u201d says Malgoire . \u201c The more TV pitches you see for investing in gold , the more you should run the other way . This is a sign of the end of gold 's run . \u201d So what 's the best investment strategy going forward ? Take some advice from Mr. T. \u201c I still believe in T-Bills , and not just because of the T , \u201d he says . Most of all , though , he stresses the importance of a balanced portfolio . \u201c Diversify \u2014 go here , go there , so you wo n't be caught out in the cold . \u201d http:\/\/video.forbes.com\/fvn\/business\/mrt-on-gold[forbesvid id= \" fvn\/business\/mrt-on-gold \" showid= \" 5 \" ] <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Place\": [], \"Employee\": [\"He\"], \"Position\": [\"as the spokesman for Gold Promise , a new gold - buying venture launched by publicly - traded Cash America , one of the world 's largest pawn brokers\"], \"Employer\": [\"Gold Promise\"], \"Task\": [\"will appear in a series of television ads where he tries new things \\u2014 playing golf , getting a spa treatment \\u2014 a product , the story goes , of him selling a few excess chains\"]}"}

Mary B. Brady was the director of the foundation from 1922 until 1967 . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> When wealthy real estate developer William Elmer Harmon founded the Harmon Foundation in 1922 , it originally supported causes as varied as playgrounds , biblical films and nursing programs . But it is better known today as one of the first major supporters of African American creativity and ingenuity . Harmon grew up in the Midwest , where his father was an officer in the 10th Cavalry regiment , a black unit known as the Buffalo Soldiers . Growing up among the soldiers likely had an impact on his attitudes toward blacks , and in particular , Harmon himself became interested in supporting them after meeting an artist who was unable to sell his paintings because of his race . The Harmon Foundation gained its now well - known focus in 1925 when it began presenting cash awards to blacks for distinguished achievements in eight fields : business , education , fine arts , literature , music , race relations , religious service , and science . Between 1928 and 1933 , the Foundation was one of the first to give national recognition to the achievements of African Americans . It is best known for its impact on African American art of the Harlem renaissance . Only a few years after the first awards were presented , the annual program was receiving such large numbers of high - quality art works that the Harmon Foundation began organizing a corresponding exhibition to provide an opportunity for the candidates to show and sell their work . These awards exhibitions gained even more national attention when they were toured to art museums , colleges , public libraries , and even YMCAs all around the country . Among the many recipients of the awards were Countee Cullen , Claude McKay , Langston Hughes , James Weldon Johnson , Laura Wheeler Waring , Sargent Johnson , and Walter White . Hale Woodruff and Palmer Hayden were the very first recipients of the William E. Harmon Foundation award for Distinguished Achievement among Negroes for fine arts . The Foundation did face criticism for actually perpetuating racial segregation in its all - black exhibitions and for patriarchal practices , in particular , using mostly white juries . Artist Romare Bearden wrote a scathing opinion article in 1934 in which he accused the Foundation of coddling artists and lowering artistic standards . The Harmon Foundation did later shift its focus from the awards to different avenues of support for black artists . But during its existence , the purpose of the awards was to stimulate creative achievement among and to bring attention to the work being accomplished by African Americans , and it became almost synonymous with Negro visual art . When the Foundation closed in the 1960s , it dispersed its considerable art collection among several institutions , including the Smithsonian 's American Art Museum and brand new National Portrait Gallery . Those conducting research or just simply interested in the artists supported by the Harmon Foundation over the years have a great wealth of information available to them at the Smithsonian Institution . The AA \/ PG Library has many of the rare original exhibition catalogs from the 1920s prizes , numerous books on the Harmon Foundation and African American artists in general , as well as Art & Artist Files for the Foundation and many of the Harmon winners , in addition to archival material donated to the library when the Foundation closed .

Stem-loop is formed when the RNA chains <event> fold <\/event> back on themselves to form a double helical tract called the ' stem ' , the unpaired nucleotides forms single stranded region called the ' loop ' . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> The dversity of function of RNA molecules in living organisms ranges from the enzyme-like activity of ribozymes to storage of genetic information in RNA viruses . RNA molecules adopt diverse structures in response to these functional requirements . RNA has a covalent structure very similar to that of DNA , the only differences being the change from a 2 ' - deoxyribose sugar in DNA to a ribose sugar in RNA and from a methyl group in thymidine to a hydrogen atom in uracil . However , their functional differences lead to correspondingly different structures . The requirement for storage of genetic information imposes the double - helical structure on most DNA molecules , whereas RNA molecules adopt an array of structures to rival protein structures in their complexity . This is not the result of an intrinsic limitation of DNA stereochemistry , but rather the result of different functional requirements . It is convenient to describe RNA structure in hierarchical terms ( Fig. 1 ) , comparable to those used in describing protein structure : primary , secondary , tertiary , and quaternary structures . The primary structure refers to the sequence of an RNA molecule . Unlike proteins , which in most cases function only when properly folded , many RNAs function as unstructured , single-stranded species . For example , messenger RNA must be unfolded for the genetic message to be translated , and stable RNA secondary structures inhibit protein biosynthesis . Figure 1 . Hierarchy of RNA folding . ( a) The primary structure corresponds to the RNA sequence . ( b , and c) The secondary structure ( in this case , two stem - loops or hairpins ) form by Watson - Crick base pairing between complementary nucleotides . ( d) Tertiary interactions ( coaxial stacking of double helices ) lead to the final three - dimensional structure ( in this case , a pseudoknot ) . 1 . Secondary Structure of RNA Secondary structure in DNA and RNA is dominated by Watson - Crick base pairing , leading to the formation of double - helical structures of varying length . Isolated base pairs are not thermodynamically stable , but formation of several consecutive base pairs readily occurs , resulting in a variety of possible arrangements ( Fig. 2 ) . These so- called secondary structure motifs represent the building blocks through which the most complex RNA three - dimensional structures are constructed . There is a fundamental difference between RNA and protein structures . Protein secondary structure is generally only marginally stable in the absence of stabilizing tertiary structure interactions , whereas RNA secondary structure is often stable on its own . Thus , formation of the secondary structure dominates the process of RNA folding , and RNA tertiary structure forms through relatively weak interactions between pre-formed secondary structure motives . Because of this property , RNA secondary structure can often be predicted successfully from thermodynamics Figure 2. RNA secondary structure motifs . ( a) Duplexes ; ( b) Single -stranded regions ; ( c ) hairpins ; ( d ) bulges ; ( e ) internal loops . RNA secondary structure is dominated by the formation of double helices stabilized by Watson - Crick base pairs between complementary stretches . Unlike DNA , these helices are relatively short , seldom more than 8 to 10 base pairs in length , and are interrupted by single - stranded nucleotides ( 1 ) or phylogeny ( 2 ) . forming loop elements : hairpins , bulges , and internal loops ( Fig. 2 ) . These , together with the helical junction that is formed when more than two double helices come together , are the secondary structure motives and the building blocks upon which the most complex RNA structures are built . In many RNAs , more than half of all nucleotides are incorporated into double - stranded helices . Duplex regions can form through very long - range interactions , and these interactions are crucial to determine and stabilize the overall fold of an RNA molecule . For example , opposite strands in double helices within ribosomal RNA can be separated by as many as 2000 nucleotides . In RNA , G-U pairs are almost as common as the canonical G - C or A -U base pairs , and they introduce slight distortions in double - helical structure that are recognized by proteins and other RNAs ( 3 , 4 ) . RNA ( and DNA ) double helices have an antiparallel right - handed helical conformation . RNA double helices adopt the A-form structure , which differs significantly from the canonical B-form adopted by DNA double helices ( see DNA Structure ) . RNA duplex structures are not uniform , although their variability is less than that in DNA . These variations depend on the sequence and structural context of the helix relative to the global three - dimensional structure . A-form double helices differ from B-DNA in the conformation of the sugar and the displacement of the bases from the helical axis . These local differences lead to very diverse shapes , with profound consequences for recognition by proteins and other ligands ( 5 ) . The most common element of RNA secondary structure is the hairpin ( or stem - loop ) ( Fig. 2 ) . For example , bacterial 16S ribosomal RNAs contains approximately 30 phylogenetically conserved hairpins ( 2 ) . A hairpin forms when the phosphodiester backbone folds back on itself to form a double - helical tract ( called the stem ) , leaving unpaired nucleotides to form a single - stranded region , called the loop . Hairpin loops represent the most extensively studied RNA structure motif ( apart from double helices ) . Small hairpin loops contain a high degree of structure , whereas longer loops ( containing more than 7 to 8 unpaired nucleotides , such as those present in transfer RNA ) are generally more poorly structured and thermodynamically less stable . Most loops in ribosomal RNA are small , 4 to 9 nucleotides in length , perhaps reflecting these thermodynamic preferences . 1.1 . Tetraloops Hairpins containing four nucleotides ( tetraloops ) are unusually common in cellular RNAs , and their sequences cluster within three exceptionally common families : UNCG , GNRA , and CUUG ( where N is any of four nucleotides and R is a purine ) . For example , 70 % of all tetraloops in 16S - like ribosomal RNAs from all organisms belong to the UNCG and GNRA families . The exceptionally common tetraloop structures have high thermodynamic stabilities , UNCG being the most stable . Capping a double - helical tract with a UNCG tetraloop is thermodynamically equivalent to extending the double - helical stem by two base pairs . Despite the differences in sequence , there are extensive structural similarities between these three families . In each of them , the first and last unpaired nucleotides form non- Watson - Crick base pairs to close the loop , reducing the number of unpaired nucleotides to only two . Longer loops , such as those found in tRNA , preserve extensive base stacking interactions that presumably stabilize the loop structure , but are generally characterized by significant conformational flexibility . 1.2 . Bulges and Internal Loops Bulges and internal loops form when two double - helical tracts are separated on either one ( bulge ) or both strands ( internal loops ) by one or more unpaired nucleotides . Internal loops containing equal numbers of bases on each strand are symmetric , whereas they are asymmetric when the number of bases are different . For example , single base mismatches are symmetric internal loops of two nucleotides . The presence of an internal loop or bulge reduces the thermodynamic stability , when compared to a perfect double helix , but unpaired nucleotides are more readily accessible to protein or nucleic acid ligands , which often recognize such sites . Non-Watson - Crick base pairs readily form within internal loops , while unpaired nucleotides within a bulge may stack within the helix or be bulged outside . The presence of an internal loop or bulge can induce bending in an RNA molecule ; the extent of bending depends on the RNA sequence within the loop and can change upon ligand binding ( 6 , 7 ) . Thus , these motifs are ideal sites for conformational switches , where ligand binding can result in long - range conformational changes . 2 . Tertiary Structure of RNA Interactions between two or more secondary structure elements give rise to RNA tertiary structure and define the overall folding of RNA molecules . In essentially all cases investigated thus far , RNA secondary structure elements maintain their three - dimensional structure even when extracted from very complex tertiary structures . Noncanonical base pairs , unpaired bases , and the backbone functional groups ( the negatively charged phosphate groups and the unique 2 - hydroxyl group of RNA ) are very important for tertiary interactions . Unpaired bases can twist or flip out of an helical patch to define unique surfaces for recognition by other RNAs during formation of the tertiary structure . The RNA secondary structure helps in orienting key residues into appropriate positions for tertiary interactions to occur . For example , the geometry of the four - way junction in tRNA , combined with a conserved length of the double - helical regions , help in positioning T-loop and D-loop nucleotides in close proximity to facilitate the tertiary loop - loop base pairs that define the L shape of all tRNAs ( 8 ) . Tertiary interactions often consist of base stacking and hydrogen bond interactions . Helical stacking between the terminal base pairs of two helices enables the building of the molecule into an extended helix ( coaxial stacking ) ( Fig. 1 ) . A common example of a structural module built upon base - stacking interactions is provided by the adenosine platform motif . Consecutive adenine bases within an internal loop can form a pseudo - A-A non - Watson - Crick base pair , to create a platform capable of mediating long - range tertiary interactions ( 9 ) . Base triplets form when a preformed base pair becomes involved in another set of hydrogen bonds with a third base ( 8 ) ; this can occur on either the minor groove or major groove side of an RNA double helix . Hydrogen bonds between bases and backbones are observed when double helices are packed together in compact structures ( 10 ) . Finally , divalent metal ions , especially hydrated magnesium ions , are often used to screen the negatively charged phosphate groups along the helical backbone , in order to build a compactly folded structure with close packing of negatively charged phosphates ( 11 ) . Unpaired nucleotides embedded within a secondary structure motif often form tertiary structures by interacting with unpaired nucleotides from another secondary structure module . These interactions can involve any secondary structure motif : hairpin loops , internal loops , and bulge loops . The nature of the tertiary contacts can be intercalation , base triplet formation , and Watson - Crick base pairing between complementary loop sequences . The loop-loop interaction module is best illustrated by the tertiary interaction of tRNA ( 8 ) . The folding of tRNA is initiated by the formation of four hairpin loops via Watson - Crick base pairing , resulting in the organization of a four - way helical junction . Tertiary interactions , by helical stacking , further organize the tRNA into two extended helical domains . This arrangement positions all unpaired residues in the loop regions close in space and facilitates the formation of the tertiary base pairing and base triplets that lock the tRNA into the L-shaped three - dimensional structure . 2.1 . Pseudoknots Pseudoknots form when complementary primary sequences of a hairpin or internal loop and a single - stranded region interact with each other by Watson - Crick base pairing ( 12 ) . When a pseudoknot forms between a hairpin loop and a complementary single - stranded region , then formation of two alternative hairpin structures can occur ( Fig. 1 ) . The formation of a pseudoknot creates an extended helical region through helical stacking of the hairpin double - helical stem and the newly formed loop- loop interaction helix . Although the pseudoknot is only marginally more stable than the two hairpins , tertiary <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Place\": [], \"Theme\": [\"the phosphodiester backbone\"], \"Resultant_configuration\": [\"a double - helical tract ( called the stem )\"]}"}

The river south of Redbourn has been the site of several watermills down the centuries , mainly for <event> grinding <\/event> corn but also put to such diverse uses as paper making , fulling cloth , silk spinning and diamond lapping . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Mills Of The Ver Valley When The Ver Was The Real Source Of Power In The Land For centuries the Ver turned mill wheels which ground grain into food for people and livestock and which powered the cleansing and thickening of cloth , the sawing of wood and a host of other small industrial processes . The main local landowner and source of political and economic power in the Middle Ages , St. Albans Abbey , knew how essential milling was to daily life . The punishments they imposed for private milling forced people to pay to use the Abbey 's watermills , helping to incite the 1381 Peasants ' Revolt locally . Only a few of the Ver 's older mill buildings remain today , the remainder lost to fire , re-building , decay and demolition . Precise sites , names , uses and building dates are often uncertain . Mill buildings that survive are now used mainly as private dwellings , small businesses or restaurants . Clean Power It 's worth reflecting that over a distance of less than 10 miles of its 15 mile length , the Ver 's waters powered around a dozen mills , providing renewable energy with no cross-generational nuclear risk and negligible carbon footprint \u2013 clean power ! This density of water - milling was not uncommon in Hertfordshire and beyond \u2013 the Colne , into which the Ver flows , served nearly thirty watermills . Unreliable Flow All this power may seem at odds with the trickle often seen in the Ver today , but remember the flow was greater prior to the substantial depletion of the chalk aquifers , which feed the Ver , to provide us with water . Also , we need to remember the ingenuity with which water was diverted into leats ( mill stream channels ) and mill ponds to provide powerful heads of water to drive mill wheels . Even so , the flow was not always reliable \u2013 in the 13th century the Abbot of St. Albans built a mill to be driven by horses because of the Ver 's capacity to dry up in summer . The water supply was not predictable enough for milling to be sustained north of Redbourn . There are no known watermill sites before the Ver is joined by the Red River ( the stream which gives Redbourn its name ) , behind the Chequers pub on Watling Street just south of the village . There was a silk mill in Redbourn village , but this was a 18th century steam-driven mill . The Domesday book refers to two mills in Redbourn , and whilst it is possible that there may have been mills within the present village , the two referred to are generally thought to refer to the known watermill sites south of the village : Do-Little and Redbournbury Mills . Do- Little Mill The photographs show the handsome mill house on Watling Street ( today 's A5183 ) and its adjacent barn . These private residences mark the site of Do-Little Mill . Over the centuries it had been re-built and known variously as the Bettespool Mill , Malt Mill , Water Corn Mill , Redbourn Little Mill and finally Do-Little Mill . The mill race was powered by a large mill pond rather than a millstream , reflecting the unreliable flow of the water here . It was converted to paper milling in 1753 , burnt down in 1783 , rebuilt as a corn mill and closed in 1927 . Today 's buildings and the former millpond lie on the west side of Watling Street , but the mill was on the east side . It was the widening of Watling Street in 1950 which caused the mill to be demolished . According to the mediaeval chronicler Thomas Walsingham , in 1344 a 5 year old girl 's recovery from falling into the mill race and being thrown out by the wheel was due to her mother 's prayer to St. Alban . Redbournbury Mill This beautifully located working mill is well worth a visit \u2013 normally open and working on Sunday afternoons . Bread and flour can be bought there some mornings . Why not buy your bread here if your morning commute takes you along the A5183 between Redbourn and St. Albans ? See Redbournbury Mill . Milling at Redbournbury goes back to at least Saxon times . Variously owned by the Abbey , the crown and Gorhambury Estates , it was much re-built in 1790 and restored after a fire in 1987 \u2013 seven centuries after the mediaeval mill here had also burned down ! Using sluice gates , a \u201c leat \u201d was built to divert water from the river and build up a head to pour over the mill wheel . The water filled buckets in the wheel , the weight keeping it turning . Water power was first supplemented by the end of 19th century by a steam or gas engine . The last tenant in the 1950s was Ivy Hawkins , \u201c the last lady miller in England \u201d , whose family had run the mill since the 19th century . The mill was re-built after the 1987 fire . A 1930s diesel engine was obtained and restored to provide power to turn the stones to grind the local wheat into the flour to make today 's bread . Shafford Mill This handsome building dates mainly from the 1840s . It features a long , and still flowing , mill stream above the meadows to the east of Watling Street between St. Albans and Redbourn . The now private house and garden are on the ' island ' between the millstream and the river channel . In 1669 , the miller here also farmed wheat and barley , ran a flour shop and leased Redbournbury mill ! Shafford , Do-Little and Redbournbury mills were then owned by the Speaker of the Restoration Parliament , Gorhambury - based Sir Harbottle Grimston . Pre ( or Prae ) Mill Pre Mill , just north of the Pr\u00e9 Hotel , was most recently a saw mil , now derelict \u2013 the photograph is from the 1980s . But milling here also goes back to the Middle Ages . The name probably comes from the nearby Roman Praetorian Gate to Verulamium . The other photographs show the neighbouring mill cottages , and Pre Mill House from the Ver meadows looking east from the Gorhambury estate . In the 16th century , Prae Mill pumped water up to Gorhambury House . There is some evidence of other mills between Shafford and Kingsbury \u2013 the site of a Ditchmill mentioned in the late 12th century is either where Prae Mill is now or a little downstream . Kingsbury Mill Another mill and accompanying miller 's house well worth a visit . The museum containing the mill workings \u2013 and the waffle house restaurant in the mill \u2013 are open most days . This was the Abbot 's malt mill , in the parish of St. Michael 's , St. Albans , and passed into Sir Francis Bacon 's family at Gorhambury after the Dissolution of the Monasteries . The present building is Tudor , with a later Georgian brick fa\u00e7ade , but the site is probably one of the thee St. Albans mills mentioned in the Domesday book . Milling for flour and then animal foodstuffs continued until the mid 20th century . In 1973 , the mill was turned into a working mill museum , waffle house and gift shop . Abbey Mills Opposite the Ye Olde Fighting Cocks inn in Verulam Park , these were last in use as silk mills , to which they had been fully converted in 1804 . The Abbey Mills had been important corn mills when the Abbey was at the height of its power , and probably long before . The mill race still gushes out opposite the inn , although the once - successful silk mills were closed in the 1930s and demolished in the 1950s . The mill buildings are now used as houses and apartments . Cotton Mill This photograph of the Ver flowing between the old swimming pool and the Cottonmill Lane allotments shows the site of an important St. Albans mill from the late 18th to late 19th century . Used variously for diamonds , cotton , candlewicks , wool and grain , in the 1840s over 60 people worked in this mill . The map detail is from an 1822 map in Clutterbuck 's The History of the County of Hertford . The letter P shows the cotton mill where the river flows under Cottonmill Lane . Holywell House and its ornamental lake no longer exist . The Stankfield Mill referred to the 12th century is generally thought to be have been located here , although Chris Saunders ( see sources ) locates this between Sopwell and New Barnes Mills . Sopwell Mill The mill on this site is predominantly late Victorian after fire destroyed its predecessor , a little further upstream , in 1868 . It is now a private house , Sopwell Hill Farm , just off the Ver Valley Walk further down Cottonmill Lane . Sopwell Mill was probably one of the three St. Albans mills referred to in the Domesday Book . There was certainly a mill here at the time of the Peasants ' Revolt . It was still grinding corn until the Second World War , and had been a paper mill in the 16th and 17th centuries . New Barnes Mill This mill at the bottom of Cottonmill Lane stands near to the Sopwell House Hotel . The present buildings , used for light industry and business , date mainly from the late 19th century , although have been extended as recently as the 1990s . Again , there was earlier milling here under the Abbey 's control . Flour was milled here up to the 2nd World War . Park Mill Park Street 's mill , near where the Ver crosses Watling Street for the last time , was another of the Abbey 's mills , believed to have been built in the late 11th century . The present building is a 19th century structure which has now been converted into flats . The mill wheel is visible , although the millstream has been cut off . There may have been another mill further south of Park Mill , but no evidence remains . Moor Mill Another of the Abbot 's mediaeval mills , this last mill on the Ver still has its water wheel visible inside what is now a public house and conference centre . A meal may cost you more than the \u00a3 11 which it cost the Abbots of St. Albans to rebuild this mill in 1351 . The present building dates from 1762 and was working until 1939 .

We 're talking about the so-called Pittsburgh potty , a mysterious amenity found in the basements of some older houses . There are no walls for privacy , no sinks for hand - washing \u2014 just a toilet , out in the open . \" That 's why they 've become such a mysterious thing , \" architect William J. Martin ( AIA ) , who lives in New Jersey but attended Pittsburgh 's Carnegie Mellon University , told TODAY Home . Sure enough , they 're something of a historical legend in western Pennsylvania . ( One local man is even collecting photographs of the odd toilets , and hopes to compile them into a book , according to 90.5 WESA , Pittsburgh 's NPR news station . ) To explain their purpose , many people point to Pittsburgh 's history in the steel industry . \" Since we were a steel town , they were in the open part of the basement so steel workers could come home from work , clean themselves off , change clothes and use the Pittsburgh potty before going upstairs to have dinner with the family , \" Roger Dolanch , owner of Century 21 Frontier Realty in Pittsburgh , told TODAY in an email . Another real estate agent echoed Dolanch 's explanation : \" Instead of tracking dust and dirt throughout the house after work , they would enter their house through a separate entrance right into the basement , \" Jackie Konopka , who works for Triplemint in New York City but had heard of Pittsburgh potties , told TODAY . \" Basically , they 're like historical mudrooms . \" But while the Pittsburgh potties certainly may have been used that way , that 's not the real reason they were installed . As Martin originally told 90.5 WESA , the toilets , usually found in pre-World War II houses , were actually there to prevent sewage backups in the nice part of the home . If there was a sewage backup on your street , it would come into your home through the fixture that 's lowest to the ground , he explained . \" As cities developed , there were ( sewer ) problems ... they would have backups , \" Martin , who is also involved with various historical societies and boards , told TODAY . \" When a sewer backs up , it backs up into buildings . So the idea was to put a fixture in the basement where the line came into the street , so if there was a sewer backup , it would go there instead of the main house . \" Basically , cleaning up a concrete floor in an empty basement is easier than cleaning up a nice bathroom ! That 's also why refinishing one 's basement was n't a thing back then . That 's a relatively new concept , since plumbing technology has gotten more advanced in the past 50 years or so . Despite their name , Pittsburgh potties are n't only found in Pennsylvania . We 've heard of them in New York , New Jersey , Oklahoma , Illinois and beyond . \" I think it may just be that the mythology in Pittsburgh is so strong that it made its way into the lexicon , \" Martin said . So if you have a toilet in your basement , consider it a fun piece of history . And the next time someone asks about it , you 'll have an interesting story to share .

Accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Edward , Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II <event> heralded <\/event> the start of the relay by placing her ' message to the Commonwealth and its athletes ' into the distinctive loop-design Queen 's Baton which then set off on its journey around the globe . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Queen starts 2018 Commonwealth Games baton relay The Queen has started the countdown to the 2018 Commonwealth Games , launching the baton relay at Buckingham Palace . She handed the baton to two - time Olympic champion cyclist Anna Meares on Monday as it started its journey to host country Australia . The relay will span 388 days , 71 countries and more than 200,000 miles before reaching the Gold Coast . The Queen and other Royals marked Commonwealth Day with a service at Westminster Abbey . The games begin on 4 April 2018 . Australian Paralympian Kurt Fearnley brought the baton to the palace before it was given to the Queen . After placing a message inside , the monarch then handed it on to his fellow countrywoman Meares . She was joined by her former rival and now friend , Team GB champion cyclist Victoria Pendleton , to start the first leg of the relay . \" Being a former athlete , the Commonwealth Games are very special , \" said Meares . \" They are something that you work very hard for , but you only get the chance to compete once every four years . When the Queen 's baton starts , you get a little flutter in your chest as you knew it was getting close . \" The Gold Coast , with its iconic beaches and the Australian lifestyle , they are just waiting and itching to welcome the world there . It is the biggest sporting event of the decade for our country and the anticipation is building . \" Queen 's commitment to Commonwealth unwavering By Peter Hunt , BBC diplomatic and royal correspondent As she stood on the makeshift stage in the Buckingham Palace forecourt , the Queen might have been tempted to reflect on one of the benefits of longevity . Her commitment to the Commonwealth has been unwavering ; that of her ministers , in the past , less so . Take Ted Heath . For him , in the 1970s , the Common Market trumped the Commonwealth . Other prime ministers have been wary of a loose affiliation of nations that battled against apartheid in South Africa but which have , sometimes , struggled to uphold principles of accountability and respect for human rights . But post-Brexit , the club of 52 countries is taking on greater significance for the UK government . The Commonwealth makes up a relatively small part of UK trade . As we leave the European Union , Number 10 wants to increase exports to these countries . Where the baton is headed over the next 388 days , will British goods , in greater numbers , one day follow ? Pendleton added : \" It is an honour to be recognised and be asked to participate in something like this . There will be lots of people on the route who have volunteered ... and it will be their way of connecting with the whole Commonwealth Games and what it means to people . \" It is the first time I have been part of a Queen 's baton relay so for me it was ... a massive honour . \" School children from all of the countries represented at the games were also at the event and there was a performance from Australian singer Cody Simpson . The Commonwealth Day service at the abbey was also attended by the monarch , the Duke of Edinburgh , the Prince of Wales , the Duchess of Cornwall , Prince Harry , the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex , as well as Prime Minister Theresa May . Olympic gold medallist Jessica Ennis - Hill brought the baton into the abbey at the start of the ceremony . The multi-faith service saw performances from a range of musicians from across the Commonwealth , along with speeches from religious leaders . This year 's theme was \" a peace - building Commonwealth \" . In a message to the 2.4 billion Commonwealth citizens , printed in the order of service , the Queen wrote : \" The cornerstones on which peace is founded are , quite simply , respect and understanding for one another . \" Working together , we build peace by defending the dignity of every individual and community . \" As members of the Commonwealth family , we can find much to be thankful for in the inheritances we have received from those who came before us . Through consensus and co-operation , great things have been achieved . \" Commonwealth secretary general Baroness Scotland also gave her own Commonwealth Day message , read at flag ceremonies around the country . She said : \" By linking governments and institutions - both public and private - and bringing together in a spirit of goodwill people of all ages and from all walks of life , Commonwealth gatherings and networks lay foundations of respect and understanding that enable lasting peace to be built . \" <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Event\": [\"2018 Commonwealth Games baton relay\"], \"Communicator\": [\"The Queen\"], \"Place\": [\"at Buckingham Palace\"], \"Individual\": [\"to two - time Olympic champion cyclist Anna Meares\"], \"Time\": [\"on Monday\"], \"Medium\": [\"a message\"]}"}

He repeated the feat in Chicago , where he built the basis for the Cubs ' later success by signing and developing the talents of Frank Chance , Joe Tinker , and Johnny Evers , among others . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Frank Selee Frank Gibson Selee Inducted to the Hall of Fame in : 1999 Primary team : Boston Braves Primary position : Manager Long before managers had scouts , sabermetrics or video at their disposal , Frank Selee was one of the first master talent evaluators in baseball history . Selee himself never played an inning of major league baseball . He was working at a watch factory in Waltham , Mass . , when he learned to play the game with an amateur team from nearby Melrose . In 1884 , Selee quit his job and raised $ 1,000 to form a minor league team . His reputation for having a sharp baseball mind soon spread to the major leagues , and in 1890 Selee was named manager of the National League 's Boston Beaneaters . In just his second season at the helm , Selee and his Beaneaters won 87 games and captured their first of three consecutive National League pennants . In 1892 , Boston became the first NL team to win 100 games . Two years later , the Beaneaters set a league record for runs scored and became the only National League club from 1885 - 1921 to hit more than 100 home runs . In 12 seasons as Boston 's manager , Selee complied a .607 winning percentage and captured five league pennants . \u201c Frank Selee is yet a young man , but he has established for himself a reputation as one of the foremost managers in the profession , \u201d wrote the New York Clipper . \u201c He has a quiet yet decisive way that probably enables him with better results than is attained by managers who make a great deal of noise and unnecessary bluster . \u201d Contrary to the rough tactics of rival clubs like the Baltimore Orioles , Selee encouraged his players to play a more civilized style . His teams surpassed brawnier opponents by hitting behind runners , employing the bunt and utilizing the double steal . \u201c The fact that the Bostons have always been noted for their gentlemanly deportment is due , in a great measure , to the example set by Selee , \u201d reads a banquet program from the era , \u201c who will not countenance anything that savors of rowdyism or \u201c dirty \u201d ball . The standing of the club during his incumbency is a tribute to his skill as a manager and his credit as a man . \u201d Though it was said that Selee could \u201c tell a ballplayer in his street clothes , \u201d it was his ability to see where that talent could be utilized on the diamond that made him a top-rate skipper . In Boston , Selee converted minor league outfielder Jimmy Collins into a Hall of Fame third baseman . Then , he took a struggling left-handed catcher named Fred Tenney and molded him into an elite first baseman who perfected the 3 - 6 - 3 double play . Historian David Nemec described Selee as having \u201c a flair for bending players acquired from here , there and everywhere . [ He was ] a master at putting together a team better than the sum of its parts . \u201d In 1902 , Selee was released by Boston and invited to the Windy City to manage the Chicago Cubs . In short time , Selee laid the foundation for the Cubs , who had experienced a down stretch in the National League , to become a powerhouse . In the winter of 1903 , Selee traded two players to the Cardinals for rookie pitcher and future Hall of Famer Mordecai \u201c Three Finger \u201d Brown . Meanwhile , Selee was also busy assembling one of the greatest infields in baseball history . He acquired minor league third baseman Joe Tinker and moved him to shortstop , picked up 20 - year old second baseman Johnny Evers from the New York State League , and moved catcher Frank Chance to first base . Soon these three players would be forever linked as the famous double play combination of \u201c Tinker to Evers to Chance . \u201d Those players would go on to win four out of five pennants and two World Series championships from 1906 - 10 . But the Cubs ' grand architect would be forced to watch their success from a hospital bed . Citing poor health , Selee retired from baseball during the 1905 season and turned the team over to Chance . Selee died on July 5 , 1909 , from tuberculosis at the age of 49 . Selee retired with a winning percentage of .598 over 16 seasons as a manager . He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1999 .

Arahad Nadeem has become the first- ever Pakistani athlete to qualify for the final of any track and field event in the Olympics . The Pakistani javelin thrower was placed in group B for the contest in which the athlete had to throw a minimum of 83.5 m to directly qualify for the final . Only six athletes could do so , and Arshad was one of them while the rest of the six athletes advanced to the finals on basis of their respective farthest throw . In his first attempt , the 24- year - old Pakistani athlete could reach the 78.5 m mark but in the second attempt , Arshad created history with a throw of 85.16 m that also placed him on top of group B . This was overall the third - best throw in the contest after India 's Neeraj Chopra ( 86.65 m ) and Germany 's Johannes Vetter ( 85.64 m ) . This is also Arshad 's third - best throw in a competition . Earlier this year , Arshad threw the javelin to a distance of 86.39 m for his personal best and a national record during the Imam Reza championship in Iran . Earlier in 2019 , he threw 86.29 m at South Asian Games in Nepal .

Fares has also commented on the topic of sexual harassment within the gaming industry which was brought up at The Game Awards 2021 with respect to Activision Blizzard and its CEO Bobby Kotick , saying \u201c I think sometimes you need to go through some shit to get to the other side . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> You can never accuse Josef Fares , director of the critically acclaimed , 2021 co - op action - adventure \u201c It Takes Two , \u201d of blowing his time in the spotlight . Even with just 30 seconds of allotted time to give his acceptance speech for winning game of the year at this month 's Game Awards in Los Angeles , he managed to make things memorably odd by telling everyone in the crowd : \u201c If you do n't have children , go get them . \u201d It was something of a full - circle moment for Fares , who , as part of a promo spot at 2017 \u2032s Game Awards , transformed himself into a viral sensation with a colorful rant whose thesis was \u201c F - -- the Oscars . \u201d Four years later , there he was taking home the biggest award at the gaming industry 's biggest show . Speaking to The Post , he reflected on both Game Awards moments , as well as his place in a rapidly changing industry . Before the interview , conducted over Zoom , could even begin , Fares panned the camera over to his toddler daughter and showered her with affection . \u201c This is my daughter , \u201d he said . \u201c I f------ love her so much . \u2026 Of course , I do n't think everybody should get kids . That just came out of my mouth [ onstage ] because , like , it 's such a wild trip to have kids , and I really love it . These days I hear a lot of youngsters that do n't want kids , which is absolutely okay as well . But I 'm just saying that you 're going to miss out on something , man . \u201d If there was any confusion as to why Fares used his precious handful of seconds on the Game Awards stage to encourage large - scale childbirth and \/ or adoption , he quickly dispelled it during the interview . \u201c I never plan a speech at all , \u201d said Fares , who explained he was n't expecting \u201c It Takes Two \u201d to win game of the year . \u201c The only thing I had in my head was that I needed to thank my team and my daughter . \u201d Fares 's ebullient attitude toward parenting does not match that of his game , which is about two bickering parents who are transformed into toys while their daughter braces for their impending divorce . From his perspective , however , \u201c It Takes Two \u201d is ultimately optimistic . \u201c The story is n't really about how it is to be divorced , \u201d he said . \u201c It 's about these two people that should find each other again in this harsh situation . Then they realize how they forgot about their daughter . \u201d At the Game Awards , thanking his team and his daughter ended up being just about all Fares had time to do . The ceremony devotes a significant chunk of runtime to announcements and ad spots , more so than to the awards themselves . Fares , however , said he does not have an ax to grind with the Game Awards in the same way he does with the Oscars . In fact , contrary to what many believe , he does n't really hold a grudge against the Oscars , either . \u201c When I came to Game Awards 2017 , everybody was talking like , ' This is the Oscars of games , ' \" Fares explained . \u201c So onstage , me being me , instantly in my head I was like , ' F - -- the Oscars , we 're having a great time [ here instead ] . ' That was where it came from . It was n't a statement that I think the Oscars are bad . \u201d Fares remains glad he said it , though , because he believes games deserve more respect from Hollywood . \u201c As someone who 's been on both sides , doing six feature films and now four games , I 'm telling you : When I go back and make a movie \u2014 which I will someday in the future \u2014 it 'll be like taking a vacation , \u201d he said . He then cited an example : the herculean task that was cramming \u201c It Takes Two \u201d full of far more than two game mechanics . \u201c We have an extreme amount of different mechanics , and we need to take them to a level where it makes sense , polish - wise , \u201d he said . \u201c Not only that , we had to create bosses , enemies and all that , and every boss takes around six to nine months to create . How it functions for the player is around five to six minutes of play , but it 's an extreme amount of stuff in the background . \u201d Fares clarified that he does n't think movies are easy to make , but with so many moving parts , he sees video game production as a more complex art . \u201c It 's interactive entertainment . You have your audience going loose , and you 're creating everything from the ground up , \u201d he explained . \u201c [ With a movie ] , you have an actor , you have a human being , you have a voice , you have movement , you have environment , you have sound , you have over 100 years of how to plan a movie and do a script . \u2026 And it 's a much more controllable medium . \u201d Despite the difficulty , Fares feels like he and his 65 - person team at Swedish studio Hazelight have made significant progress since he directed his first game , \u201c Brothers : A Tale of Two Sons , \u201d back in 2013 . \u201c It Takes Two \u201d regularly blurs genre lines , introducing mechanics as far-flung as \u201c Diablo \u201d - style , hack - and - slash action , third - person shooting and \u201c Tony Hawk \u201d - esque rail grinding , but Fares said development was relatively smooth sailing . Certainly the team had to omit some exciting ideas \u2014 including a section in which one player obtains a hammer and the other a nail , which would have allowed players to nail enemies to the ground \u2014 but , by and large , their meticulous planning paid off . \u201c The thing is , with this game we hardly did any crunch , \u201d Fares said . \u201c We managed to do it in a good way . We planned good . Sometimes , of course , [ crunch ] happened , but it was rare . That 's our approach to the next one as well , so hopefully we can keep doing that . \u201d Fares could not say what Hazelight 's next game is , but he was happy to elaborate on what it 's definitely not . While many video game publishers are diving into the deep ends of live - service games and NFTs \u2014 games that encourage players to spend money via endless updates and controversial \u201c non - fungible tokens \u201d that utilize the blockchain to confer ownership , respectively \u2014 Fares emphasized that the buzzword - laden zeitgeist is not for him . \u201c Live service ? We 'll never have that , \u201d he said . \u201c People can work with that , and I 'm not saying replayability is bad for every game . Some games are actually designed for it . I 'm just saying [ for ] the games we do \u2014 story - based games , most single - player games \u2014 the focus on replayability should n't be there because that 's not what it 's about . We already have a problem that people are not even finishing single - player experience games , so why focus on replayability ? \u201d Fares had even harsher words for NFTs , saying that he 'd rather get \u201c shot in the knee \u201d than include them in future games . \u201c Let me tell you this : Whatever decision you take in a game , where you have to adjust the design to make the player pay or do something that makes you want him to pay money , that is wrong , if you ask me . If you make a game [ with the goal of telling ] a story , I think it 's wrong , \u201d Fares said . \u201c Now , if you ask a big CEO that runs a company , he would say I 'm stupid because companies are about making money . But I would still say no . For me , gaming is art . \u201d The aforementioned big CEOs were another major subject at this year 's Game Awards , with serious allegations against Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick buzzing on the lips of nearly everyone in attendance . Following an outcry over host Geoff Keighley 's initial response to the Activision Blizzard situation ( a week before the Game Awards , Keighley told The Post he was still considering how to \u201c navigate \u201d the ceremony 's involvement with the publisher ) , the show opened with a call for support of game creators , saying that the industry \u201c should not and will not tolerate any abuse , harassment or predatory practice by anyone . \u201d Fares applauded the moment , which he hopes spurs growth for the industry . \u201c I think we need to mature like every other industry , \u201d Fares said . \u201c I think sometimes you need to go through some s--- to get to the other side . That 's what 's happening . \u201d As a resident of Sweden , a country where unions are far more common and centralized than in the U.S. , Fares added that he believes unions and organizing efforts like walkouts are an important part of the solution . But he does n't believe they 're a silver bullet . \u201c Yeah , for sure [ unions help ] , \" Fares said . \u201c But that 's just one of the things . I do n't think it solves everything . Education and knowledge , I think that 's most important . The gaming industry is not that old . We 're learning all the time . \u2026 If someone has done something bad , sure it 's bad , but I also want to see how we fix this . \u201d When it came to his own role in facilitating fixes , however , he said that as studio director , he prefers to focus on the creative side of things and leave workplace culture to other Hazelight team members \u2014 even though senior creatives have been accused of failing to prevent workplace discrimination at companies like Activision Blizzard and Ubisoft . \u201c I 'm the head of creative . We have another guy who 's head of the studio , \u201d Fares said . \u201c People are happy at our place . And also the [ other studio leaders ] are still doing stuff and making changes , so people are getting more and more comfortable , but I do n't know in detail exactly because that 's not really what I do . \u201d On the whole , Fares is optimistic , even if prospects might look bleak for an industry that seems to surface a new worker mistreatment scandal every other week . \u201c You can become a bit pessimistic when you hear it 's happening everywhere , \u201d Fares said , \u201c but I think we 're going toward a brighter future . \u201d <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Agent\": [], \"Time\": [], \"Place\": [], \"Target\": [\"Josef Fares\"]}"}

Report by James Caldwell , PWTorch assistant editor Impact opened cold with Abyss having a hold of TNA president Dixie Carter . The Reaction - style camera followed Abyss as he dragged Carter around backstage toward the Impact Zone . Carter begged for mercy as Abyss dragged her where \" they \" have instructed her to go . Abyss threatened anyone who tried to help her before shoving away the cameraman . Impact Zone : Abyss , with Carter , made it into the Impact Zone as Carter asked for someone to help . Abyss said tonight is a preview of what happens at 10 - 10 - 10 at Bound for Glory . He said at the PPV , Carter will be gone , gone , gone from TNA . Abyss said \" they \" wanted to ask Carter one final question before the PPV : \" Do you prefer Janice or Bob ? \" Eric Bischoff came jogging down the entrance ramp and tried to approach Abyss . Terry Taylor joined in as Bischoff shouted at everyone to back off . TNA agents eventually got their camera time helping Carter escape from Abyss . Abyss backed away as Bischoff asked for the director to cut away . Before they cut to break , Sting 's music hit . Bischoff was then handed a headset from the red-headed floor manager as Sting , Kevin Nash , and The Pope showed up on stage apparently to confront Bischoff , who was no-selling their presence since he was busy on the headset . [ Commercial Break ] Impact Zone : Nash , Pope , and Sting were kind of standing around in the ring with Bischoff as they returned from break . Pope was the first to speak . He said maybe it 's time he retracts his statement from last week when he called Eric a \" no good son of a Bischoff . \" Pope said maybe Bischoff is good by continuing to run the smoke and mirrors routine . He said Abyss might not be the smartest monster , he had one thing right that at Bound for Glory , the walls are going to come crashing down on Bischoff . Bischoff said he respects Pope , but he does n't know what he 's talking about . \" You do n't have a clue , \" he said . Pope said they 're not 300 lions , but three calculating wolves . Pope said Bischoff has made it perfectly clear that this thing is bigger than Pope . Bischoff said Pope is following around Nash and Sting like they think they know what they 're talking about . He said Pope is just like a dog chasing its tail . Pope said he 's tired of talking to Bischoff . Bischoff said this thing is about Sting and Hulk Hogan . Sting stepped forward and took the mic . He said Bischoff is \" dead on \" about this . Back to ten years ago in ol ' WCW . Sting said the best way to end this is for Hogan to get back in the ring . He said this is n't about wrestling anymore ( was it ever about wrestling ? ) , but it 's about life . Sting asked Bischoff if Hogan is ready to \" put it all out there \" and put it on the line .

The regulator 's chairman Lord Faulks told a group of complainants it would not be \u201c proportionate \u201d to launch an investigation before the impact of recent training given to Jewish Chronicle staff can be assessed . He also pointed to the newspaper 's 2020 change of ownership and recent changes in editorial leadership . Stephen Pollard stepped down as editor after 13 years last month , and was succeeded by his deputy Jake Wallis Simons . In an email , Lord Faulks said concerns about the Jewish Chronicle 's compliance with the Editors ' Code and its handling of complaints have been \u201c continuously monitored \u201d by IPSO since early 2018 . He wrote in December : \u201c The executive decided targeted training to all members of the editorial team would be an appropriate and proportionate course of action to remedy the concerns identified . A specially tailored training programme conducted in cooperation with the editorial leadership of the Jewish Chronicle has been developed and delivered during the course of this year . The publication has cooperated fully with these efforts , ensuring that staff attended the sessions conducted by IPSO . \u201c Taking this into account , along with the size of the publication and the changes of ownership and personnel it has undergone during the relevant period , it is the board 's decision that it would not be proportionate to launch a standards investigation at this time before the effects of the training programme and the other changes at the Jewish Chronicle can be fully assessed . \u201d Lord Faulks added that IPSO 's executive would conduct a review in six months to check whether the training and other changes \u201c have been embedded in the Jewish Chronicle 's editorial practices \u201d and report back to the board with a view on whether any further action from the regulator is required . The group of complainants said in a statement that the decision not to launch an investigation \u201c sends the message to IPSO members that no behaviour by them could ever be bad enough to prompt even a formal investigation , let alone disciplinary action \u201d . Scroll down or click here to see the full statement from IPSO Original story 6 August 2021 : The Independent Press Standards Organisation has been asked to use its powers to launch a standards investigation into the Jewish Chronicle . The press regulator has never yet instigated a standards investigation , its most serious potential action , since its inception seven years ago . Nine people who won libel or IPSO complaints against the Jewish Chronicle in the past three years have written to the regulator asking it to consider taking the action to tackle what they allege are \u201c systemic \u201d issues . Between July 2018 and July 2021 the weekly newspaper paid out and apologised in four libel cases . Most recently , expelled Labour activist Marc Wadsworth was falsely accused of being involved in a group planning to target Jewish people in the Labour Party . Mrs Justice Collins Rice , who oversaw the public apology , said : \u201c This was a serious mistake for the Jewish Chronicle to have made . \u201d In the same time period IPSO upheld , at least in part , nine complaints about the Jewish Chronicle relating to Clause 1 ( accuracy ) of the Editors ' Code of Practice , to which all IPSO members are signed up . Of the other complaints IPSO formally investigated in those three years , it chose not to uphold six and its mediation helped to resolve a further two . Press Gazette understands around 40 complaints did not reach the IPSO investigation stage , for reasons that could include being resolved amicably with the newspaper or because the regulator did not consider there were any potential breaches of the code . IPSO , which regulates most of the UK 's traditional national and regional newspaper brands , has not yet launched any standards investigations since its creation in 2014 to replace the Press Complaints Commission . IPSO says this action is reserved for when it has \u201c serious concerns \u201d about the actions or behaviour of a member publisher , including \u201c serious and systemic \u201d breaches of the Editors ' Code . The most serious penalties within IPSO 's powers include a fine of up to \u00a3 1 m , ordering the payment of reasonable costs for the investigation , and membership termination . [ Read more : Jewish Chronicle pays damages over claims councillor invited ' anti-Semitic ' activist to event ] IPSO did carry out training for Jewish Chronicle staff on compliance with the Editors ' Code of Practice last month . Nine of the legal and IPSO complainants , most of whom are connected to the Labour Party in some way , co-signed a letter to IPSO chairman Lord Faulks , who replaced Sir Alan Moses in January 2020 . They said the upheld rulings of the past three years make it \u201c clear that the paper 's editorial standards are shockingly low and IPSO 's actions to date have made no difference \u201d . \u201c We have all either seen our complaints to IPSO about the Jewish Chronicle 's bad journalism upheld or secured admissions of libel from the paper . Unless standards there improve there will be more victims , while readers will continue to be misled , \u201d they said in a letter published by Jo Bird , a Labour councillor in Wirral who won a complaint against the paper on a point of accuracy last month . In June Jewish Chronicle readers ' editor Richard Burton wrote in response to one of the IPSO complaints in question , pointing out that it was only upheld on one accuracy point while several other arguments were dismissed . The group 's request has been received by IPSO 's standards department , which will decide what action , if any , is proportionate . Short of a full standards investigation this can include further staff training , raising specific concerns , or targeted monitoring . Any decision to launch a standards investigation would ultimately be a matter for the IPSO board which , led by Lord Faulks , usually meets six times per year . [ Read more : Jewish Chronicle under new ownership as consortium 's ' very generous ' offer accepted ] A spokesperson for the regulator told Press Gazette : \u201c IPSO can undertake a standards investigation where it has serious concerns about the behaviour or actions of one of its regulated publishers . \u201c These concerns could include serious and systemic breaches of the Editors ' Code ; where a publisher 's annual compliance statement raises significant concerns ; or in exceptional circumstances , because of substantial legal issues or Editors ' Code compliance issues . \u201c IPSO actively monitors complaints , compliance with the Editors ' Code and the wider media landscape to ensure publishers uphold the highest possible standards . \u201c We aim to take action to address issues of concern in a proportionate way , ideally at an early stage . IPSO recently delivered training on Editors ' Code compliance to staff at the Jewish Chronicle , a service which is available to all regulated publishers . \u201c IPSO 's board makes any decision about whether or not to launch a standards investigation after careful consideration of all available evidence . \u201d [ Read more : Jewish Chronicle pays out \u00a3 50,000 and apologises for wrongly linking charity to terror group ] The Jewish Chronicle declined to comment for this story . Full statement from IPSO on 5 January 2021 : IPSO has the power to launch a standards investigation , its most serious sanction , where there are exceptional concerns about the behaviour or actions of one of its regulated publishers . This could include serious and systemic breaches of the Editors ' Code ; where a publisher 's annual compliance statement raises significant concerns ; or in specific circumstances , because of substantial legal or Code compliance issues . It is important that any regulatory intervention is appropriate , proportionate and in line with IPSO 's regulations . IPSO 's Board has carefully considered the concerns raised about editorial standards at the Jewish Chronicle . It has decided that it would not be proportionate to launch such an investigation at this time . Although the Board noted issues with the Jewish Chronicle 's compliance with the Editors ' Code , the publication has engaged with extensive specialist training in the past six months and there have been changes in ownership and personnel during the relevant period . A review will be conducted in six months to assess whether the training and other changes have been embedded in the Jewish Chronicle 's editorial practices and to consider whether any further action is required . As the independent regulator of most newspapers and magazines in the UK , IPSO actively monitors complaints , compliance with the Editors ' Code and the wider media landscape to ensure regulated publishers uphold the highest possible standards . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Place\": [\"the Jewish Chronicle\"], \"Time\": [\"since early 2018\"], \"Entity\": [\"standards\"]}"}

Scrapie ) Cattle disposal schemes Publications Public health issues Science & research Statistics Other useful links BSE site directory BSE FAQ BSE general Q&A Glossary Contacts Links The BSE Inquiry Report , published in October 2000 , concluded that the development of the BSE epidemic resulted from the use of infectious meat and bone meal ( MBM ) in cattle feed . The MBM had been produced by the rendering ( industrial cooking ) of carcases of cattle infected with BSE . Cattle feed contaminated with pig or poultry feed containing MBM continued to infect cattle after the 1988 ban on the use of ruminant MBM in cattle feed , although the feed ban and 1990 Specified Bovine Offal ( SBO ) controls markedly reduced the risk of infection . The feeding of MBM to all farmed animals was banned in 1996 and an EU - wide ban has been in place since 2001 . Exactly what caused the first case of BSE before the disease was amplified by feeding infectious bovine MBM back to cattle remains uncertain . The BSE Inquiry suggested that a new transmissible spongiform encephalopathy ( TSE ) agent emerged in the 1970s and that the first cases of BSE in the 1970s and 1980s escaped detection . The cause of this new agent was likely to have been a new mutation affecting the prion protein ( PrP ) in cattle , or possibly in sheep . The BSE Inquiry commented that it was a common misconception that a reduction in rendering temperature or a failure to prescribe minimum rendering times led to a failure of inactivation of the scrapie agent and its subsequent transmission to cattle . Changes in the rendering industry in the 1970s and early 1980s \u2013 a switch from batch to continuous processing and the abandonment of solvent extraction of tallow \u2013 might have led to a reduction in the inactivation of the BSE agent . However , the BSE Inquiry noted that processes used previously were also incapable of completely inactivating TSE agents . The BSE Inquiry concluded that all the evidence pointed to the specific association of an abnormal form of the prion protein ( PrP ) and TSEs . Normal PrPC is harmless . In TSEs , PrPC is converted to an abnormal form known as PrPSc resulting in the death of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord . The BSE Inquiry noted that all the sources of BSE examined had shown the same characteristics in mice . The same strain had been detected in exotic ungulates and carnivores from zoos and in cats developing feline spongiform encephalopathy ( FSE ) . The BSE Inquiry also discounted alternative theories for the cause of BSE such as the organophosphate and the autoimmune theories . The Government published a ' Response to the Report of the BSE Inquiry ' ( 478 KB ) . Great Britain first introduced statutory rendering controls in 1981 . These were aimed at reducing the contamination of animal feed with Salmonella . European Council Directive 90\/667\/EC introduced harmonised rendering standards across the European Community and these were implemented in Great Britain by the Animal By- Products Order 1992 . These were the first statutory time \/ temperature controls to be applied to the rendering process . That year the European Commission also commissioned a study to assess how effective the different rendering processes operating in the EC were at inactivating TSE agents . The most effective rendering process involved a temperature of 133oC and 3 - bar pressure for a minimum of 20 minutes . As a result the Commission introduced new standards in 1997 . In October 2002 , the EU adopted Regulation ( EC ) No.1774\/2002 . The Regulation ensured that only materials derived from animal declared fit for human consumption could be used for the production of animal feed . It also banned intra-species recycling . In the light of the BSE Inquiry 's conclusions , the Government asked a committee led by Professor Gabriel Horn to review the scientific findings on the origins of BSE , including evidence presented to the BSE Inquiry and emerging findings . Their Review of the Origin of BSE ( 257 KB ) was considered by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee ( SEAC ) and published on 19 July 2001 . The Horn Review agreed with most of the conclusions of the BSE Inquiry . The Horn Review explored the reasons for the BSE epidemic beginning in Britain in the 1970s \/ early 1980s . MBM had been fed for several years in a number of countries , many of which also had sheep with scrapie . The Horn Review concluded that an unusual combination of events occurred in the UK in the 1970s \/1980s . These related to changes in rendering practices producing a ten - fold increase in the amount of TSE infectivity surviving , the feeding of rations containing MBM to very young calves , a high ratio of sheep to cattle and an infectious agent in the MBM \u2013 possibly derived from sheep with scrapie , a sporadic mutation in a cow or other sources such as goats or exotic ungulates . In November 2001 , the European Commission 's Standing Scientific Committee published a scientific report ( 647 KB ) on the origin of BSE and the transmission of BSE . In 2005 , Defra published an independent review ( 181 KB ) of BSE cases born after the 1996 reinforced feed ban ( BARB cases ) , carried out by Professor William Hill FRS of the University of Edinburgh . Further information on BARB cases and the Government 's response to the Hill Review is available ( 553 KB ) . In 2004 , Italy and France reported the detection of a small number of cases with different molecular characteristics to BSE cases seen previously . Several other European countries ( including Denmark , Poland , Belgium , The Netherlands , Sweden , Switzerland , and Germany ) as well as Japan , the United States of America and Canada have also reported similar cases . These cases have primarily been detected by active surveillance in cattle over 10 years of age , on the basis of the molecular characteristics of the disease - associated prion protein ( PrPsc ) . They fall into two groups - those with Lower molecular weight PrPsc ( L-Type ) and those with Higher molecular weight PrPsc ( H-Type ) . The Italian L-Type cases have also been described as Bovine Amyloidotic Spongiform Encephalopathy ( BASE ) due to the due to the presence of amyloid plaques in their brains . Experimental studies have shown that both H- Type and L-Type BSE retain their molecular characteristics following experimental transmission to mice . In August 2006 , the Veterinary Laboratories Agency began a retrospective examination of brain samples taken from previous BSE cases as part of a research programme . The aim of the studies is to determine whether different forms of BSE have occurred in the UK in the past . Although the studies are ongoing , they have so far identified a single case of H-type BSE in a 13 year old cow which was tested as fallen stock and confirmed with BSE in 2005 . Further information on the retrospective studies ( SE1795 and SE1796 ) is available .

Lateral view of part of the mantle and head of a 30 mm ML C. scabra showing tubercles . Photograph by R. Young . C. scabra , the only species in the genus , is small ( 150 mm ML ) and one of the most distinctive cranchiids . The mantle is covered by large , multi-pointed cartilagenous tubercles ( see Roper and Lu 1990 , for a description of the tubercle structure ) . When disturbed , the squid often pulls its head and arms into the mantle cavity and folds its fins tightly against the mantle to form a turgid ball . The tubercules , presumably , provide some type of protection but it is unclear what predators are affected and how . In addition , the squid may ink into the mantle cavity , making the ball opaque . This was thought to be an aberrant behavior due to stress and confinement of shipboard aquaria until the same inking behavior was seen in cranchiids from submersibles ( Hunt , 1996 ) . The function of this behavior is unknown . Brief diagnosis : A cranchiin ... - with mantle covered with cartilagenous tubercules . Characteristics - Tentacles - Suckers in a transverse row on club manus of equal size . - Diagonally set pairs of suckers and pad on distal 2\/3 of tentacular stalk . - Head - Eyes sessile in paralarvae . - Beaks : Descriptions can be found here : Lower beak ; upper beak . - Funnel - Funnel valve present , large . - Mantle - Mantle covered with cartilagenous tubercles bearing 3 - 5 sharp cusps . - Fins - Each fin nearly oval in shape with free posterior lobes . - Photophores - Fourteen oval photophores on each eye ( ventral - proximal series of 8 photophores , ventral - distal series of 4 photophores near lens and dorsal series of two photophores near lens ) .

Ventral view of a maturing ( ? ) but damaged female C. scabra , Gulf of Mexico , 150 mm ML , showing the red-pigmented photophores at the tips of the arms . Photograph by M. Vecchione . Comments Characteristics are from Voss ( 1980 ) . More details of the description of C. scabra can be found here . Behavior The small C. scabra below , photographed in a shipboard aquarium , has retracted its head with arms and tentacles into the mantle cavity . The mantle has taken the shape of a sphere and the chromatophores have expanded . This response to disturbance perhaps makes their consumption by small- mouthed predators more difficult . The photographs below , also taken in an aquarium , show two different color phases of the same squid . A typical transparent phase on the right and a peculiar anteriorly pigmented phase on the left . The half - pigmented phase was seen several times ( D. Fenolio , pers. communication ) . Figure . Two side views of the same C. scabra , Sea of Japan , ca. 10 cm ML. Photographs by Dant\u00e9 Fenolio . Life History Small paralarvae lack tubercles and are similar in appearance to paralarvae of Liocranchia . However they can easily be separated from paralarvae of Liocranchia by the numerous , scattered chromatophores that cover much or all of the mantle and by the short , thick tentacles that appear to be rugose or , possibly , glandular . Note the sessile eyes . By 8 mm ML they have numerous tubercules . Figure . Paralarval C. scabra . Left - Ventral and dorsal views , 4.7 mm ML , Hawaiian waters .

The Brandywine Battlefield Park covers only , but during the battle British troops marched about north , <event> fording <\/event> the creek above the forks , to outflank Washington 's forces . Before the battle , General Anthony Wayne had his headquarters in Brandywine Village , across the creek from Wilmington , and Continental troops camped nearby , near Lovering Avenue . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> History of the Battle of the Brandywine September 9 , 1777 : Washington Prepares Defenses Philadelphia , the capital of the newly formed nation , was the goal of British General Howe during the campaign of 1777 . The British approached Philadelphia from the Chesapeake , landing at Head of Elk , Maryland ( present day Elkton ) . As the British began their march toward the city , Washington and the people of Philadelphia were confident that the British could be stopped . Washington chose the high ground in the area of Chadds Ford to defend against the British advance . Chadds Ford allowed safe passage across the Brandywine River on the road from Baltimore to Philadelphia . On the morning of September 9th Washington placed his troops along the Brandywine River to guard the main fords . By placing detachments of troops at Pyle 's Ford \u2014 the southernmost possible crossing of the river \u2014 and Wistar 's Ford \u2014 the northernmost crossing of the river before it forked \u2014 Washington hoped to force a fight at Chadds Ford , an advantageous position . Washington believed that he had all of the fords along the Brandywine guarded by his troops and that the closest unguarded ford was twelve miles up-river . Washington was confident that the area was secure . The British grouped at nearby Kennett Square and formulated a plan . A portion of the British army was to march from Kennett Square as if they intended to meet Washington on the banks of the river at Chadds Ford . Meanwhile , the majority of the army under Howe 's direction would march north of Wistar 's Ford , cross the river at a ford unknown to Washington , and march south into the flank of the American forces . Superior tactics and better knowledge of the area allowed the British to outwit Washington and his army . September 11 , 1777 : The Day of the Battle The day of the battle began with a heavy fog which blanketed the area , providing cover for the approaching British troops . When the fog cleared , the sun blazed and the heat was sweltering . The first reports of British troop movements indicated to Washington that Howe had divided his forces . Subsequent reports both confirmed and denied this report . In the confusion Washington persisted in the mistaken belief that the British were sending their entire force against his line at Chadds Ford . Meanwhile , Howe and the majority of his force continued their approach . By mid-afternoon the British had crossed the river at the unguarded ford to the north of Washington 's force and they had gained a strategic position near Birmingham Friends Meeting House . When the British appeared on the American right flank , Washington realized that he had been outmaneuvered . He ordered his army to take the high ground around Birmingham Friends Meeting House as a last defense . Unfortunately , in the confusion caused by the surprise , the Americans were unable to successfully defend their position . The Americans fought valiantly , but they had been outwitted on the rolling hills along the Brandywine . Nightfall finally brought an end to the battle . The defeated Americans retreated to Chester . The bulk of the army arrived by midnight with the remainder trickling in until dawn . General Howe 's exhausted men camped on the battlefield and the surrounding countryside including the farmyards of Benjamin Ring and Gideon Gilpin . British Captain John Andre wrote in his journal , \" Night and the fatigue the soldiers had undergone prevented any pursuit . \" September 26 , 1777 : The Result : The British Take Philadelphia Although the American army was forced to retreat after the Battle of Brandywine , the defeat did not demoralize the men . They believed the defeat was not the result of poor fighting ability but rather because of unfamiliarity with the landscape and poor reconnaissance information . During the next several days , General Howe and his Army moved closer to Philadelphia with little opposition from Washington . The two armies maneuvered in hopes of finding the other at a disadvantage , but no decisive military actions were taken during the next two weeks . Congress abandoned Philadelphia and moved first to Lancaster and then to York to escape before the British takeover . Important military supplies were moved out of the Philadelphia area to Reading , Pennsylvania , where they could be defended . Washington responded cautiously after the battle . The impending loss of Philadelphia hurt the patriot cause , and Washington 's force had dropped from a high of nearly 15,000 prior to the battle to only 6,000 . Washington wrote to Alexander Hamilton on the 22nd , \" The distressed situation of the army , for want of blankets and many necessary articles of clothing , is truly deplorable , and inevitably must bring destruction to it , unless a speedy remedy is applied . \" Local leaders did what they could to supply the army with food and clothing . Reinforcements sent by Congress began to arrive , and Washington felt the army was sufficiently ready to mount an attack . However , it was too late to save Philadelphia , for on September 26th a column of British soldiers marched into the patriot capital unopposed .

Its real estate subsidy was at risk to default on repayment of bonds , yet the Dubai government was unsuccessful to <event> make <\/event> a rescue package for the company . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Q. Where did Dubai go wrong ? I thought it was in the \" oil - rich Gulf \" ? A. Dubai is part of the United Arab Emirates , seven city - states which have separate ruling families , separate budgets , but security , immigration and foreign policies in common . Abu Dhabi has nearly all the UAE 's oil . To keep up , Dubai from the 1950s on diversified its economy into ports , trade , services and finance , largely successfully . But its liquidity - fuelled real estate and tourism binge in the last decade may have been one step too far . Q. What is the extent of its problems ? A. The emirate has said it has $ 80bn of debts , though some analysts say the true figure could be double that . Dubai World , the state - owned holding company whose bail - out plans triggered the current crisis , has liabilities of about $ 60 bn , though only part of that is debt . The main problem is its real estate subsidiary Nakheel , which has huge bonds coming due , including an Islamic bond for $ 3.5 bn in December . It appears to have little cash flow to meet payments - as well as relying on debt , it also sold most developments off- plan , with new developments now on hold . Q. The big market crash after Lehman Brothers folded was more than a year ago . Why has Dubai only just been hit ? A. The property crash hit Dubai at the time - house prices fell 50 pc in six months . Nakheel was known to be in trouble . But investors assumed that as a state - owned company it would not default on its debt . The government refused to issue detailed statements of how it was to handle Dubai World 's debt problems , and rounded on those who said that the crash had undermined Dubai 's development model . This encouraged a belief that a rescue package was already in place , probably funded by Abu Dhabi . The statement on Wednesday that the government was asking for a six-month standstill on repayments implied the rescue was in doubt . Q. Why has n't Abu Dhabi come to Dubai 's aid ? It has the world 's largest sovereign wealth fund . A. Abu Dhabi has , via the federal central bank , bought one $ 10 bn bond issued by the Dubai government earlier this year , and , via its own banks , bought another $ 5 bn bond this week . But the latter came with a rider that it was not to be used for the Dubai World bail - out . This raises two questions : what are the other debts for which it is to be used ? And how is the Dubai World debt to be met , even after the six-month delay , if Abu Dhabi will not fund the rescue package ? Q. What about other Dubai companies ? How are they doing ? A. Dubai World owns DP World , the successful ports operator which bought P&O. Other arms of the Dubai government , and the ruling family 's directly owned holding companies , also own successful companies such as Emirates Airlines and Jumeirah Hotels , as well as stakes in buildings and businesses around the world , including the London Stock Exchange . But the emirate 's lack of transparency and relatively untested financial legal system means that no - one knows if these can be demanded as collateral against Dubai World and other government debts . Q. Nevertheless , exposure of western banks to the debt seems quite small compared to the trillions of dollars to which we have become accustomed . Why the panic ? A. At the most basic level , fears that exposed banks will have to write down losses , and that both Dubai and Abu Dhabi may have to sell worldwide assets , has hit prices everywhere . At an \" animal spirits \" level , the disclosure of significant unforeseen problems in Dubai has refocused attention on where else might have hidden \" black holes \" . The health of sovereign debt worldwide , already seen as the major financial issue for the next decade , is also being reexamined . Q. Can Dubai survive ? A. Dubai is still seen as the premier place to do business in the Middle East and beyond . It is a preferred base for not just Arab but Pakistani , Iranian and even Indian businesses , due to the wider region 's political uncertainty . Its reputation for liberal attitudes helps . But events this week have damaged its reputation for economic competence , which the emirate 's rulers will now have to work hard to restore . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Created_entity\": [\"a rescue package\"], \"Creator\": [\"Abu Dhabi\"], \"Place\": [\"Abu Dhabi\"]}"}

Saudi Arabia is claiming to have shot down a ballistic missile near the holy city of Mecca , that was reportedly fired by Yemen 's Houthi rebels more than 500 km across the border . The Saudi-led military coalition \u2013 which is backing Yemen 's pro-government forces in the conflict with the rebels \u2013 said it \u201c intercepted and destroyed \u201d the missile on Friday before it could do any damage \u2013 about 65 km from Mecca , one of Islam 's most sacred sites . It would be the deepest strike yet to hit Saudi Arabia , which has been engaged in a series of deadly border clashes with the Houthis since they overthrew the Yemeni government in 2014 and seized large parts of the country , including the capital , Sanaa . Mohammed al- Bekheity , a Houthi leader , vehemently denied that the missile targeted Mecca . \u201c We do not target civilians and , in turn , we would not target holy areas , \u201d he said . Al - Bekheity said the aim behind the coalition 's allegation was to garner sympathy from Muslims and the international community . \u201c After Saudi Arabia 's crimes against Yemenis were exposed , drawing international sympathy towards Yemen , here it is using such allegations to attract attention towards it , \u201d he said . The Houthi-affiliated SABA news agency reported that the missile hit the international airport in the Saudi city of Jeddah . However , Abdulmalak Alsham , an airport official , told Al Jazeera that there was no missile strike on the airport . READ MORE : What does Saudi Arabia want for Yemen and Syria ? The missile was launched from Saada province , a Houthi stronghold just across the border from Saudi Arabia . In response to the missile attack , the Saudi military launched air strikes against the rebels , targeting the area where the missile was fired from . It is the second time this month the rebels have fired a missile of that range . On October 9 , the coalition said it intercepted a missile near Taif , the site of a Saudi airbase . Taif is about 70 km from Mecca .

Its leading article on Wednesday was a full - frontal assault on politicians , on anyone , hopeful of upending the EU referendum vote for Brexit . It carried a front - page blurb for its editorial saying : \u201c Damn the unpatriotic Bremoaners and their plot to subvert the will of the British people . \u201d And it reinforced that message with three adjectives in the headline over its full page article : \u201c Whingeing . Contemptuous . Unpatriotic . Damn the Bremoaners and their plot to subvert the will of the British people \u201d . The savage tone of the 1,400 - word leader suggests a nervousness about the possibility that MPs might reverse or , at the least , mitigate , the referendum result . Some of Dacre 's b\u00eates noires from across the political spectrum were treated with particular contempt , including the former chancellor George Osborne , former Labour leader Ed Miliband and the former deputy prime minister and Lib Dem leader , Nick Clegg . Other MPs who campaigned for Remain got it in the neck as did the Treasury , the CBI and , somewhat more predictably , the BBC . Dacre prefers to use a blunderbuss rather than a rifle when going on the attack . His outrage appears to have been stimulated by the \u201c hysterical and entirely bogus \u201d claim by the Treasury that Britain will be up to \u00a3 66bn a year poorer if the country \u201c fully breaks free of the shackles imposed by Brussels . \u201d That study , said the Mail , was commissioned by Osborne , who is described as \u201c the architect of the utterly discredited Project Fear and a man whose bitterness at being removed from office is one of the more unedifying spectacles in politics . \u201d As for \u201c trades union puppet \u201d Miliband and Clegg , they are \u201c the most egregious Remainers of all \u201d for \u201c demanding that parliament must have the final vote on the terms of the UK 's departure from the EU . \u201d According to the editorial , the BBC 's great sin is to have \u201c given copious airtime \u201d to politicians making \u201c unsubstantiated claims of impending doom for the UK outside of the single market . \u201d These include \u201c the embittered pro-EU ramblings of the wet-behind - the - ears ex- Tory ministers Nicky Morgan and Anna Soubry . \u201d Evidently \u201c the BBC is now bitterly regretting its admirable impartiality during the referendum and has returned to type \u201d by \u201c leading the Remain charge . \u201d The \u201c Bremoaners \u201d are also said to include \u201c the pro-Brussels CBI business group \u201d because of its claim that \u201c big employers will not possibly be able to cope without unskilled mass immigration from the EU \u201d . This , said the Mail , represents \u201c an unpatriotic , defeatist position which will enrage people in communities whose schools , health services and housing cannot cope with the existing number of migrants . \u201d In a key passage , the leading article stated : \u201c To all these embittered Remainers , the Mail has a simple message : You lost . Stop the anti-democratic games and respect the emphatic verdict of the British people . From the moment the referendum result became clear , Remain have been sore losers : incredulous that the British people could be so disrespectful as to reject their wisdom , and increasingly furious that the economy far from collapsing , as predicted by Mr Osborne , is flourishing . So it was that they resorted to desperate subterfuge . \u201d This \u201c subterfuge \u201d involves the \u201c petulant and unacceptable \u201d Remain side inventing a term , \u201c hard Brexit \u201d , in order to demand a \u201c soft Brexit \u201d to keep the UK within the single market . By contrast , there was praise for Dacre 's new- found political heroine , Theresa May , for having crushed the Remainers ' \u201c lingering hopes that Brexit was a bad dream that might never happen . \u201d There were tributes to her \u201c devastating and entirely accurate critique of a metropolitan elite that sneers at the public 's concerns about mass immigration \u201d and her dismissal of the views of \u201c a well - heeled group of London ' intellectuals ' \u201d . This was a leading article reflecting Dacre 's personal opinions . If it was not written by him , then it was certainly done at his dictation . That said , it is highly likely that the leader also reflects the views of the majority of the Mail 's readership . Of the almost 2,000 comments below the online version of the editorial , the overwhelming majority were in favour . Many of them picked up on the arguments in the editorial 's final paragraphs about the Remain side \u201c being sore losers \u201d and being \u201c deeply unpatriotic . \u201d In conclusion , the Mail \/ Dacre said : \u201c Is it really too much to hope that the penny might now finally drop with the metropolitan elite , who for decades have ignored the wishes of their fellow countrymen ? \u201c It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that their contempt for democracy and the public is more to do with their own political ambitions than with concern for the future of Britain . \u201d <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Cause\": [], \"Actor\": [\"politicians\", \"anyone\"], \"Process\": [\"the EU referendum vote for Brexit\"], \"Place\": [\"UK\"], \"Time\": [\"From the moment the referendum result became clear\"]}"}

Written by multiple authors , the series was set 25 to 30 years after the original films and introduced the Yuuzhan Vong , a powerful alien race attempting to <event> invade <\/event> and conquer the entire galaxy . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> If we define \" aliens \" as non-humans , then from Wookies to Ewoks to Yoda , there are literally hundreds of aliens featured in all of Star Wars . If we define \" aliens \" as simply being intelligent life not found on the planet Earth , then literally everyone - including the \" humans \" Obi-Wan , Han Solo , Rey , and Leia - are all aliens , too . The diversity of species in Star Wars is never really spoken about directly , it 's just a fact of life , and accordingly , no one uses the word \" alien , \" in any of the films . And yet , in nearly twenty Star Wars novels published between 1999 and 2003 , a giant alien invasion trope threatened the galaxy , and the legitimacy of Star Wars right along with it . When the Star Wars canon was reorganized a few years ago , article after article decried the loss of the \" Expanded Universe \" . The basic complaint was tat Mara Jade and Grand Admiral Thrawn and all the cool stuff from Star Wars books were taken away from the fans and turned into \" Legends , \" which was code for non- canonical stories ; glorified , monetized fan fiction in the Disney age . But , to my knowledge , most fans of the EU were n't ( and are n't ) really losing any sleep about getting rid of the massive storyline which runs through the majority of the EU's New Jedi Order series . I 'm talking about the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the Star Wars galaxy ; a moment in Star Wars fandom only slightly less dark than introduction of Jar Jar Binks . First thing 's first : if you 're really into Star Wars books , you certainly read these things for character stuff and not necessarily the plots . The characters and their legacy are the enduring cool things about these books , including The New Jedi Order . Plus , to be perfectly crystal clear , a ton of these books were written by fantastic science fiction and fantasy writers including R.A. Salvatore , Michael Stackpole , Karen Traviss , Walter Jon Williams , Grey Keyes , Troy Denning , Michael Jan Freidman , Elaine Cunningham , James Luceno , Kathy Tyres and many more quality writers . I 'm not sure any of these writers can be blamed for the fumble of the Yuuzhan Vong storyline at all . The project the project was conceived as a crossover between Bantam Spectra and Dark Horse Comics prior to 1999 . But , 1999 was the year that Star Wars books switched from being published by Bantam Spectra to Del Rey , which is where they effectively have lived every since . And so , who had responsibility for the idea is unclear , but regardless of origin and ownership , it was a bad one . And certainly did n't warrant so many books fleshing out this giant war . Who were the Yuuzhan Vong ? Only the worst and most clich\u00e9 alien invaders of all time ! They hate technology , and as such , are like free - range organic aliens intent on purging the galaxy of anything they deem impure . Unlike the complex politics of the Empire , or the Republic , or even the Jedi , the destructive evil of the Yuuzhan Vong is black and white : they must be stopped at all costs because they are killing machines . Did I mention they kill Chewie in the very first book in which they appear ? Yeah . They drop a whole moon on him and he dies . Do n't you love this storyline ? It 's your favorite Star Wars thing ever . The Yuuzhan Vong also have nifty staffs that can block lightsabers , and they 're notoriously hard to kill with the existing conventional weaponry found in Star Wars . Translation : SNOOZE PATROL ! Nothing about the Yuuzhan Vong was ever remotely scary , because they were seemingly so unstoppable . Also , because they operated with a generic hive - mind strategy , they come across like a shoddy cross between zombies , the aliens from Starship Troopers and , you guessed it , the aliens from Independence Day . Star Wars is many cheesy things , but an alien invasion clich\u00e9 never seems to be something to stick into this universe . Why not just do a time travel story while you 're at it ? How about vampires ? I mean , why not ? These days , with the Give Us Legends campaign , and other fan efforts to legitimize the various Star Wars comics and novels published prior to 2014 , there seems to be a tendency to look at all these stories through rose- colored glasses . Even the beloved Timothy Zahn \" Thrawn Trilogy \" ( Heir to the Empire , Dark Force Rising and The Last Command ) are n't as solid as you might remember them . Influential to be sure . Creative and well written : certainly . But even the Zahn books fall prey to the use of the word \" alien \" to describe the Noghri , the savage race of creatures who mostly serve as bodyguards to Grand Admiral Thrawn . Indeed , the idea that Emperor Palpatine was a giant xenophobe , someone who hated \" aliens \" , comes primarily from the Star Wars books , not from the films . Sure , it makes sense to cast the Emperor as an all - around evil bad guy , but does he need to be space Hitler , too ? Some might be nodding their heads yes , while others might remember that the Emperor was surrounded by a lot of non-humans in the prequels , so maybe he was n't such an outer - space racist after all ? Sure , he hated the Jedi , but that seemed more like an ideological thing than a diversity thing . I 'm not defending the Emperor any more than I 'm saying that all the books in The New Jedi Order were bad . They were n't ! Plus , literally everything that happens with Jacen Solo in these books laid the groundwork for what we ended up getting with Kylo Ren . Still , I cant help but feel that the one great thing about Star Wars - it 's avoidance of the played out alien invasion clich\u00e9 - was slapped onto this rich fictional universe , and nearly strangled the Star Wars - ness out of Star Wars with its gross claws . If losing the Expanded Universe means forgetting the Yuuzhan Vong invasion ever happened then I say : good riddance to bad generic alien invasion rubbish . - Darth Vader is Back !

Published on May 10 , 2008 Plenty of spoilers here ! Tonight 's rather good - though badly plot-holed - effort from writer Stephen Greenhorn ( who also wrote last season 's The Lazarus Experiment ) and director Alice Troughton was once again undermined by incessant music telling us when to cry , when to be excited , when to reflect \u2026 we 're lucky series composer Murray Gold has n't got a ' bouncy spring ' player in his orchestra , or they 'd probably punctuate the jokes with ' twang ' effects , Carry - on style . Producer Phil Collinson at least spares us the ' rimshot sting ' on punchlines . Collinson is doubtless a very busy man indeed , but he really ought to make time for the extras in his DVD collection , where he 'll find a phalanx of interviewed movie composers saying , over and over again , that a good score is just as much about when there is n't any music . Silence is also an instrument in a score , creating tension , letting the actors perform and the story breathe , and maximising the effect of music when it comes . I know I 've moaned about this before , and I 'll stop moaning about it when they stop washing Who senseless with a score that should accentuate the story but instead becomes - by repetition - meaningless muzak . Okay then . Last week 's end-of - episode Tardis hi-jack lands the Doctor , Donna and semi-reluctant passenger Dr. Martha Jones in very familiar Who territory \u2013 a dank and fairly cheap series of underground tunnels , where they are almost immediately set-upon by the human contingent in an eternal war that is being fought with the liquid - breathing \u2013 but actually rather nice - ' Hath ' . Desperately in need of back - up troops , the soldiers force the Doctor 's hand into a cloning machine , which the breakneck pace of the show dictates must produce a fully - formed ( and fully dressed ) female spin-off Doctor - clone within ten seconds . The nameless , fully - trained blonde that emerges is played by Georgia Moffett , the daughter of fifth Doctor Peter Davison . Why Donna and Martha are not cloned is never explained , but it certainly would have cost the show focus to have two Tate-style whingers running about , so let 's be glad of it . A skirmish with the sinister - looking Hath erupts immediately , and Martha is taken prisoner by the liquid - breathing aliens whilst the Doctor and Donna are led to General Cobb ( Excalibur 's Nigel Terry , who puts in a customary first - rate performance ) . Cobb informs them that the humans are engaged in a relentless war that has gone on for generations following the Hath betrayal of a mixed human \/ Hath colony centuries ago . Cloning machines now fuel a war that apparently will never have an end until the ' source ' is found \u2013 a mythical and potent object which the warriors associate with God . The Doctor discovers a hidden section to the map that both sides are using , inadvertantly sending the humans and the Hath on collission course . Our Gallifrean hero wears his pacifist credentials on his sleeve , and when he objects to Cobb 's genocidal intentions , is locked up along with Donna and his impromptu progeny , whom Donna has named ' Jenny ' and who is now feared to share the Doctor 's peace - loving ideals . Over in Hath-land , Martha Jones wakes up next to her wounded captor in the debris of an explosion , relocates his shoulder ( having had some difficulty finding it ) and instantly makes a friend of the aliens , who are n't nearly as nasty as they look . In fact the monster of The Doctor 's Daughter is really the war-like Cobb , who equates peace with victory at any cost . The fine points of the Doctor 's pacifism are discussed whilst trapped in the cell , where Donna begins to see a logical pattern in the apparently banal number - plates that are riveted onto the walls of the underground complex . However , it 's not another ' big bad wolf ' scenario , and Ms. Noble is destined to solve it by episode 's end . In the meantime , the Doctor 's course is clear \u2013 escape and bring peace where there 's war . Writer Greenhorn gets them out of the cell with a rather lazy ' seduction ploy ' , and by the inclusion of the classic ' dumbest guard in the world ' character , but never mind \u2013 our heroes are free , and suddenly the Doctor realises that his ' daughter ' shares old assistant Leela 's trigger - happy habits . Despite his reluctance to accept the Moffett character as any part of himself , he starts handing out lectures - and actually seems to be softening \u2026 I 'm tempted to theorise that it 's the medium budget episodes of Who that satisfy most these days . The confined corridors and straightfoward matte painting that greets Martha when she escapes to planet Messaline 's rather gothic surface are n't budget - breakers , and a story like The Doctor 's Daughter has to stand on the quality of its ideas and writing \u2026 which , for the most part , it does . I am biased , being a tremendous Baker-ite ; this episode is quite redolent of Baker-era Who , with plenty of dark and cheap corridors to run down and two under-manned warring factions for the Doctor to bring peace to , if he can . But the dizzy pace of the series does n't relapse into John - Nathan Turner - style languidness , and the make - up and design of the Hath is excellent . They could have walked straight out of Bioshock , and it 's almost a disappointment that they 're so nice . Donna 's role as the Doctor 's conscience is beginning to take shape , and I must admit that it 's refreshing to have an assistant who therefore serves a purpose other than needing to be rescued and asking ' What 's that , Doctor ' . Tate has toned down the grating voice a tad , which is welcome . Hopefully Tennant will eventually stop shouting too \u2013 it 's a dramatic tool that ( like excessive music ) becomes meaningless if over-used . Freema Agyman acquits herself well in a moment of tragedy on the planet 's surface ( how does an alien with scuba-breathing equipment on drown , by the way ? ) , and we see that the ' problem ' \u2013 the BBC clearly believe there was one \u2013 with Martha Jones was that she had been under-written and under-motivated ; they 're not making the same mistake with Tate , and I do feel sorry for Agyeman in that respect . The BBC , unwilling to take Who canon so far out of its roots as to have the Doctor regenerate female , has literally split off part of his character into Moffet 's new and equally nameless Gallifrean . There is early promise in The Doctor 's Daughter that Moffett will join the Tardis crew , at which point we know her death is inevitable \u2013 assistants are announced and feted a year before the series goes on air . Greenhorn cunningly uses this to convince us that Moffett 's death at Cobb 's hand at the end of the episode is for keeps ( more about the future of Moffett 's clone - Doctor here ) . It is n't . Putting an audience through the wringer with a character 's death , only to revive them later , is admittedly a pretty cheap trick ; but this is outshone by the big surprise at ' Jenny ' 's career - choice at the conclusion of The Doctor 's Daughter . Wow . Daughter interestingly showed a tender \u2013 and very hurt \u2013 side to the Doctor which we rarely glimpse , particularly in his initial denial of Moffett 's validity as his own flesh and blood . It was also interesting to hear the Doctor refer to his previous child ( or children , since Carol Ann Ford played William Hartnell 's granddaughter originally ) . It was n't clear from the writing just how the Tardis had been summoned \/ hijacked into this episode at the conclusion of The Poison Sky - Daughter 's end -of - episode post-mortem was a clumsy , dated flourish that , to boot , shed little light on the matter . Oh well ... Next week , the Doctor and Donna meet Agatha Christie \u2013 let 's hope it 's better than Black Orchid . Check out last week 's episode , The Poison Sky , which was reviewed by Simon and Martin . Doctor Who interviews at Geek ...

Mr Dikko , who had fled Nigeria after a military coup , was accused of stealing $ 1 bn ( \u00c2\u00a3 625 m ) of government money . The plot was foiled by a young British customs officer , Charles David Morrow , who has now told the BBC World Service Witness programme what happened . On a summer 's day , Mr Dikko walked out of his front door in an upmarket neighbourhood of Bayswater in London . Within seconds he had been grabbed by two men and bundled into the back of a transit van . \" I remember the very violent way in which I was grabbed and hurled into a van , with a huge fellow sitting on my head - and the way in which they immediately put on me handcuffs and chains on my legs , \" he told the BBC a year later . Mr Dikko had been minister for transport in the government of Shehu Shagari until it was overthrown by the military at the end of 1983 . He fled to London accused by Nigeria 's new rulers of embezzlement - a charge he has always denied . Labelled \" Nigeria 's most wanted man \" , a plot was hatched to get both him and the money back . The extraordinary plan was to kidnap Mr Dikko , drug him , stick him into a specially made crate and put him on a plane back to Nigeria - alive . Israeli anaesthetist An Israeli alleged former Mossad agent , Alexander Barak , was recruited to lead the kidnap team . It included a Nigerian intelligence officer , Maj Mohammed Yusufu , and Israeli nationals Felix Abitbol and Dr Lev-Arie Shapiro , who was to inject Mr Dikko with an anaesthetic . The kidnappers switched vehicles in a car park by London Zoo and headed towards Stansted airport where a Nigerian Airways plane was waiting . They injected Mr Dikko and laid him , unconscious , in a crate . The Israeli anaesthetist climbed into the crate as well , carrying medical equipment to make sure Mr Dikko did n't die en route . Barak and Abitbol got into a second crate . Both boxes were then sealed . At the cargo terminal of Stansted Airport , 40 miles ( 64 km ) north of London , a Nigerian diplomat was anxiously waiting for the crates to arrive . Also on duty that day was a young customs officer , Charles David Morrow . Diplomatic bag \" The day had gone fairly normally until about 3 pm . Then we had the handling agents come through and say that there was a cargo due to go on a Nigerian Airways 707 , but the people delivering it did n't want it manifested , \" Mr Morrow said . \" I went downstairs to see who they were and what was happening . I met a guy who turned out to be a Nigerian diplomat called Mr Edet . He showed me his passport and he said it was diplomatic cargo . Being ignorant of such matters , I asked him what it was , and he told me it was just documents and things . \" No - one on duty at Stansted had dealt with a diplomatic bag before and Mr Morrow went to check the procedure . Just then a colleague returned from the passenger terminal with some startling news . There was an All Ports Bulletin from Scotland Yard saying that a Nigerian had been kidnapped and it was suspected he would be smuggled out of the country . The police had been alerted by Mr Dikko 's secretary who had witnessed his abduction from a window in the house . Hearing the news , Mr Morrow realised he had a problem on his hands . \" I just put two and two together . The classic customs approach is not to look for the goods , you look for the space , \" he said . \" So I am looking out of the window and I can see the space which is these two crates , clearly big enough to get a man inside . We 've got a Nigerian Airways 707 , which we do n't normally see . They do n't want the crates manifested , so there would be no record of them having gone through . And there was very little other cargo going on board the aircraft . \" If you want to hide a tree , you hide it in the forest . You do n't stick it out in the middle of Essex . \" By the book But any cargo designated as a diplomatic bag is protected by the Vienna Convention from being opened by customs officers . So Mr Morrow got on the phone to the British Foreign Office . \" To qualify as a ' diplomatic bag ' they clearly had to be marked with the words ' Diplomatic Bag ' and they had to be accompanied by an accredited courier with the appropriate documentation . It was fair to say they had a Nigerian diplomat - I 'd seen his passport - but they did n't have the right paperwork and they were n't marked ' Diplomatic Bag ' , \" he said . The decision was taken that the crates could be opened - but it would be done by the book . That required the presence of a Nigerian diplomat , but as Mr Morrow pointed out , one was already on hand . By now , the crates were up on special trolleys ready to be loaded on to the plane . \" Peter , the cargo manager , hit the lid on the bottom and lifted it . And as he lifted it , the Nigerian diplomat , who was standing next to me , took off like a startled rabbit across the tarmac , \" Mr Morrow said . \" You have to remember we are on an airfield which is square miles of nothing . He ran about five yards ( 4.5 m ) , realised no - one was chasing him and then stopped . \" Peter looked into the crate and said : ' There 's bodies inside ! ' He parked a forklift truck so its tines lay across the top of the crate so it could n't be opened . Mr Morrow dialled the emergency number 999 . \" My name 's Morrow , from Customs at Stansted . We 've got some bodies in a crate . Do you think you can send someone over , \" he recalls saying . \" They said : ' Alive or Dead ? ' \" I said : ' That 's a very good point . I do n't know . ' \" They said : ' We 'll send an ambulance as well . ' \" After half an hour , police started to arrive , and they opened the second crate . Inside they found an unconscious Mr Dikko , and a very much awake Israeli anaesthetist . Mr Dikko was lying on his back in the corner of the crate . \" He had no shirt on , he had a heart monitor on him , and he had a tube in his throat to keep his airway open . No shoes and socks and handcuffs around his ankles . The Israeli anaesthetist was in there , clearly to keep him alive , \" recalls Mr Morrow . The kidnappers in the other crate were unrepentant . They said Mr Dikko was the biggest crook in the world . The Nigerian intelligence officer and the three Israelis all received prison sentences in the UK . Diplomatic relations between the UK and Nigeria broke down and were only fully restored two years later . The Nigerian and Israeli governments have always denied involvement in the kidnapping . Mr Dikko returned to Nigeria the following decade and still lives there . Mr Morrow was commended for actions that day by the head of UK Customs , who described the incident as a \" very tricky situation \" . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Victim\": [\"Umaru Dikko\"], \"Time\": [\"On a summer 's day\"], \"Place\": [\"in an upmarket neighbourhood of Bayswater in London\"], \"Perpetrator\": [\"An Israeli alleged former Mossad agent , Alexander Barak\", \"Maj Mohammed Yusufu\", \"Felix Abitbol\", \"Dr Lev-Arie Shapiro\"]}"}

Guilty verdicts on charges of <event> murder <\/event> , attempted murder , and violent attacks on immigrants and left-wing political opponents were delivered and the leadership was sent to prison . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Greece Golden Dawn : Neo - Nazi leaders guilty of running crime gang - Published After a trial lasting more than five years , the leadership of Greece 's neo-Nazi party has been convicted of running a criminal organisation . Big crowds gathered outside the court in Athens as the judges gave verdicts on 68 defendants . Golden Dawn secured 18 MPs in 2012 , as Greeks were battered by a financial crisis . The criminal inquiry into the party began with the murder of an anti-fascist musician in 2013 . Leader Nikos Michaloliakos and six colleagues were convicted of heading a criminal group . Supporter Giorgos Roupakias was found guilty of murdering an anti-racist musician and 15 others were convicted of conspiracy in the case . Some 2,000 police were deployed around Athens Appeals Court as thousands of protesters demanded long jail terms , carrying banners that read \" fear will not win \" and \" Nazis in prison \" , Greek media reported . Tear gas was fired into the crowd as some of the protesters clashed with police and threw petrol bombs . Eleven of the defendants were in the court when the verdict was read out , along with 50 attorneys and 50 journalists . Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou said the verdict was an important day for democracy and proof that Greek institutions were able to \" fend off any attempt to undermine them \" . Hundreds of witnesses gave evidence in the trial , which was delayed this year by the Covid - 19 pandemic . Who was on trial ? At the centre of the trial are Golden Dawn leader Nikos Michaloliakos and 18 ex - MPs who were elected in 2012 when the neo -Nazi party came third in national elections on an anti-immigrant , nationalist platform . Golden Dawn no longer has any MPs in parliament . After they won almost 7 % of the vote in May 2012 , emboldened supporters attacked political opponents and migrants . Golden Dawn supporter Giorgos Roupakias had already confessed to the murder of rapper Pavlos Fyssas . The musician was chased down by thugs and stabbed in Piraeus in September 2013 . As the verdict was delivered , Fyssas 's mother Magda cried out , \" My Pavlos defeated them alone ! \" . What were the verdicts ? The key verdict on Wednesday was that Golden Dawn - Chrysi Avgi in Greek - was a criminal group . Its leadership was found guilty of running it . They included Michaloliakos and six former MPs - Ilias Kasidiaris , Ioannis Lagos , Christos Pappas , Artemis Matthaiopoulos , Ilias Panagiotaros and Giorgos Germenis . The other ex - MPs were found guilty of joining a criminal organisation . The three judges , led by Maria Lepeniotou , were due to deliver sentencing later . As well as the fatal stabbing of Pavlos Fyssas , defendants in the trial were also convicted of other violent attacks on migrants and left-wing political opponents . Five Golden Dawn members were convicted of the attempted murders of Egyptian fishermen and four of the attempted murder of communist activists in the PAME union . In the courtroom By Dimitris Psarras , investigative journalist who has tracked Golden Dawn 's rise As the Golden Dawn leaders were convicted , very few inside the room applauded but outside thousands began to celebrate . I felt very satisfied , of course . Because I knew the facts revealed during those five and a half years , and I was always optimistic . From 2010 , Golden Dawn had managed to poison the Greek political system and democratic institutions , securing contacts with the army , the police , the judiciary and the Church . It is an excellent verdict . Who is their leader ? Nikos Michaloliakos founded the movement in the mid-1980s and was admirer of Nazism and a Holocaust denier , giving the Hitler salute at party rallies . But he had always denied any knowledge of the Pavlos Fyssas murder . When police raided his home in 2013 , they found weapons and ammunition . Golden Dawn officially denied being a neo -Nazi movement , but its badge closely resembled a swastika , some senior members praised Adolf Hitler , and the clothing of choice at anti-immigrant protests was black T-shirts and combat trousers . Witnesses told the trial that members were trained to handle weapons and used Nazi symbols . Last December , chief prosecutor Adamantia Economou prompted uproar , with a call for the party officials to be cleared , arguing there was no evidence they had any part in planning or carrying out the series of attacks . How has Greece reacted There has been disgust at Golden Dawn across the political spectrum in Greece . Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he would not normally comment on court decisions but said the Greek republic had first expelled Golden Dawn from parliament and now Greece 's independent judiciary had acted too . \" Democracy won today . It is up to us that it wins every day , \" he said . The verdict was praised as \" just \" and \" historic \" by Prokopis Pavlopoulos , who was president of Greece until earlier this year . Centre-left political leader Fofi Gennimata said the decision sent a strong message to Europe that \" fascism has no place in our lives \" . Nils Muiznieks of Amnesty International also said the trial sent a clear message : that \" violent and racist criminal activity - whether perpetrated by individuals on the street or members of parliament - will not go unpunished \" .

Officials required him to start at the back of the grid because he missed qualifying . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Auto racing claimed another victim Sunday , the first at the 2 - year - old California Speedway but the second this season in CART champ car racing and the third this year in Southern California . Canadian driver Greg Moore was killed in a single - car accident described by fellow driver Alex Barron as \" the most horrifying crash I 've ever seen in front of me , \" Barron adding , \" I 've never seen anything so violent . \" Moore 's crash was witnessed on national television , just as was that of Gonzalo Rodriguez , the rookie Uruguayan driver killed Sept. 12 in the CART race at Laguna Seca . It was witnessed by the California Speedway crowd of about 90,000 . Those who stayed until the end witnessed too , not the usual champagne - spraying ceremony on the winner 's stand , but instead a prayer service by chaplain Hunter Floyd of CART Ministries . Those who stayed tuned to their TVs heard Chip Ganassi , whose first - year driver , Juan Montoya , had just given the car owner his fourth consecutive CART title say , \" I 'm not ready for the championship . I 'm not ready for the day 's [ championship ] activities . Greg was a friend of all of us . \" Reporters at the track heard other drivers trying to talk through their tears . They heard officials from CART and California Speedway say all of the right , the human , the sensitive things , expressing their own sorrow , their sympathy for Moore 's family . They talked of how Moore represented all that is good in CART racing , of his competitiveness , his love for racing , the championships he surely was going to win . Then , when all of that was done , there was a moment of silence . So what are we to make of this , a life lost in pursuit of sport ? Another life lost in pursuit of sport . Ah , if only there were an easy answer . There are always knee - jerk responses to car-racing tragedies . \" Well no wonder they kill people , they 're going much too fast , \" is an oft-heard refrain . Yes , of course , they 're going too fast . Always have been , going back to the early part of this waning century , when 40 mph was too fast . Greg Moore was traveling in excess of 200 mph when his car betrayed him . But Casey Demert was doing only about 80 last spring when he rolled his sprint car in a fatal crash at Irwindale Speedway . The late Bill France , the founder of NASCAR , used to say , \" It is n't how fast you go . It 's how fast you stop . \" Perhaps they are going too fast . The Indy Lights , which look a lot like champ cars but are about 50 mph slower , traditionally put on a better race at California Speedway than the champ cars do , at least partly because they are n't going so fast . But Rodriguez was killed on a road course , where speeds are much slower than on the high - speed ovals . And CART -- and the IRL and NASCAR -- are conscious of the ever-increasing speeds and work to harness it , partly for safety , partly so people can actually see the cars as they race . The track record at California Speedway , for instance , is 240.942 mph . Mauricio Gugelmin went that fast two years ago . After that , however , CART mandated the Handford Device to slow the champ cars on the high - speed tracks , the Michigan and California speedways . As a result , Scott Pruett , the fastest qualifier for Sunday 's race , reached only 235.398 . But the simple fact is , speed and racing are inseparable . In any race , from the three - legged race at the Cub Scout picnic to the Indianapolis 500 , the idea is to get to the end first . And to do that , you have to be the fastest . Racing organizations can -- and should -- do all they can to keep cars from becoming supersonic missiles . But technology always catches up to technology , and trying to regulate speed on the racetrack is a lot like trying to regulate the sunrise . One of the byproducts of speed on the high - speed tracks is wake turbulence . Running behind other cars can sometimes approximate rowing a shell behind a hydroplane . Before Moore 's accident , Richie Hearn lost control of his car just about where Moore would lose control of his , hitting the inside wall , as Moore would , but escaping injury . He blamed his accident on turbulence . Did the same thing happen to Moore ? Maybe . Probably . But we 'll never know for sure . There was some question of Moore 's fitness to drive . He had broken a finger Saturday morning in a motor - scooter accident and was held out of qualifying . But , fitted with a hand brace , he was allowed a test drive after qualifying , passed it and said he wanted to drive in Sunday 's race , even if it meant starting at the back of the field . Doctors said later that the break had not been a severe injury , that there never was much question about his fitness , that they had been more concerned that vibrations in the car might aggravate the injury . Other drivers have competed successfully with far more serious problems , they said . Apparently , then , if there is any fault to be found on that score , it is with Moore 's own desire to drive . But how can anyone find fault with that ? He was a driver . So , again , what are we to make of this , a life lost in pursuit of sport ? It is a tragedy . Just as it is a tragedy when a worker is killed in a construction accident . Or a young mom is killed in a traffic accident . Or dies of leukemia . Anyone 's death is a tragedy , regardless of the circumstances . In this day and age of auto racing , we sometimes tend to forget that it is an extremely dangerous venture . We see it on TV all the time . We see cars hit the wall and fly into pieces , then watch as drivers walk away -- as did Richie Hearn . We read about safety improvement , of cars built to dissipate the force of a hit , rather than absorb it , and we recall how , in years past , drivers were killed in far less serious - looking crashes . We marvel at how far the sport has come in protecting the people who practice it , how much safer it is now . But racing is not safe . It will never be safe . If it were , men like Greg Moore would have nothing to do with it . They would find something else to do , something with an edge to it . Moore 's death was a tragedy . It also was a simple accident . Accidents happen in racing . It 's unfortunate , sometimes in the extreme , as it was Sunday at California Speedway . But it 's also a simple truth , and that 's about all that can be made of it . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Authority\": [], \"Time\": [], \"Defendant\": [\"Greg Moore\"], \"Place\": [\"a test drive\"], \"Finding\": [\"passed it\"], \"Case\": [\"to drive in Sunday 's race , even if it meant starting at the back of the field\"]}"}

In the United States , for example , according to the widely recognized \" 1940 Statement on Academic Freedom and Tenure \" of the American Association of University Professors , teachers should be careful to avoid controversial matters that are unrelated to the subject discussed . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> In 1915 the Committee on Academic Freedom and Academic Tenure of the American Association of University Professors formulated a statement of principles on academic freedom and academic tenure known as the 1915 Declaration of Principles , which was officially endorsed by the Association at its Second Annual Meeting held in Washington , D.C. , December 31 , 1915 , and January 1 , 1916 . In 1925 the American Council on Education called a conference of representatives of a number of its constituent members , among them the American Association of University Professors , for the purpose of formulating a shorter statement of principles on academic freedom and tenure . The statement formulated at this conference , known as the 1925 Conference Statement on Academic Freedom and Tenure , was endorsed by the Association of American Colleges ( now the American Association of Colleges and Universities ) in 1925 and by the American Association of University Professors in 1926 . In 1940 , following a series of joint conferences begun in 1934 , representatives of the American Association of University Professors and of the Association of American Colleges ( now the American Association of Colleges and Universities ) agreed upon a restatement of principles set forth in the 1925 Conference Statement on Academic Freedom and Tenure . This restatement is known to the profession as the 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure . Following extensive discussions on the 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure with leading educational associations and with individual faculty members and administrators , a joint committee of the AAUP and the Association of American Colleges met during 1969 to reevaluate this key policy statement . On the basis of the comments received , and the discussions that ensued , the joint committee felt the preferable approach was to formulate interpretations of the 1940 Statement from the experience gained in implementing and applying it for over thirty years and of adapting it to current needs . The committee submitted to the two associations for their consideration Interpretive Comments that are included below as footnotes to the 1940 Statement . 1 These interpretations were adopted by the Council of the American Association of University Professors in April 1970 and endorsed by the Fifty - Sixth Annual Meeting as Association Policy . The purpose of this statement is to promote public understanding and support of academic freedom and tenure and agreement upon procedures to ensure them in colleges and universities . Institutions of higher education are conducted for the common good and not to further the interest of either the individual teacher or the institution as a whole . 2 The common good depends upon the free search for truth and its free exposition . Academic freedom is essential to these purposes and applies to both teaching and research . Freedom in research is fundamental to the advancement of truth . Academic freedom in its teaching aspect is fundamental for the protection of the rights of the teacher in teaching and of the student to freedom in learning . It carries with it duties correlative with rights . 3 Tenure is a means to certain ends ; specifically : ( 1 ) freedom of teaching and research and of extramural activities , and ( 2 ) a sufficient degree of economic security to make the profession attractive to men and women of ability . Freedom and economic security , hence , tenure , are indispensable to the success of an institution in fulfilling its obligations to its students and to society . Academic Freedom - Teachers are entitled to full freedom in research and in the publication of the results , subject to the adequate performance of their other academic duties ; but research for pecuniary return should be based upon an understanding with the authorities of the institution . - Teachers are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing their subject , but they should be careful not to introduce into their teaching controversial matter which has no relation to their subject . 4 Limitations of academic freedom because of religious or other aims of the institution should be clearly stated in writing at the time of the appointment . 5 - College and university teachers are citizens , members of a learned profession , and officers of an educational institution . When they speak or write as citizens , they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline , but their special position in the community imposes special obligations . As scholars and educational officers , they should remember that the public may judge their profession and their institution by their utterances . Hence they should at all times be accurate , should exercise appropriate restraint , should show respect for the opinions of others , and should make every effort to indicate that they are not speaking for the institution . 6 Academic Tenure After the expiration of a probationary period , teachers or investigators should have permanent or continuous tenure , and their service should be terminated only for adequate cause , except in the case of retirement for age , or under extraordinary circumstances because of financial exigencies . In the interpretation of this principle it is understood that the following represents acceptable academic practice : - The precise terms and conditions of every appointment should be stated in writing and be in the possession of both institution and teacher before the appointment is consummated . - Beginning with appointment to the rank of full - time instructor or a higher rank , 7 the probationary period should not exceed seven years , including within this period full - time service in all institutions of higher education ; but subject to the proviso that when , after a term of probationary service of more than three years in one or more institutions , a teacher is called to another institution , it may be agreed in writing that the new appointment is for a probationary period of not more than four years , even though thereby the person 's total probationary period in the academic profession is extended beyond the normal maximum of seven years . 8 Notice should be given at least one year prior to the expiration of the probationary period if the teacher is not to be continued in service after the expiration of that period . 9 - During the probationary period a teacher should have the academic freedom that all other members of the faculty have . 10 - Termination for cause of a continuous appointment , or the dismissal for cause of a teacher previous to the expiration of a term appointment , should , if possible , be considered by both a faculty committee and the governing board of the institution . In all cases where the facts are in dispute , the accused teacher should be informed before the hearing in writing of the charges and should have the opportunity to be heard in his or her own defense by all bodies that pass judgment upon the case . The teacher should be permitted to be accompanied by an advisor of his or her own choosing who may act as counsel . There should be a full stenographic record of the hearing available to the parties concerned . In the hearing of charges of incompetence the testimony should include that of teachers and other scholars , either from the teacher 's own or from other institutions . Teachers on continuous appointment who are dismissed for reasons not involving moral turpitude should receive their salaries for at least a year from the date of notification of dismissal whether or not they are continued in their duties at the institution . 11 - Termination of a continuous appointment because of financial exigency should be demonstrably bona fide . Endorsers The 1940 Statement of Principles has been endorsed by more than 250 scholarly and education groups . Endnotes : 1 . The Introduction to the Interpretive Comments notes : In the thirty years since their promulgation , the principles of the 1940 \u201c Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure \u201d have undergone a substantial amount of refinement . This has evolved through a variety of processes , including customary acceptance , understandings mutually arrived at between institutions and professors or their representatives , investigations and reports by the American Association of University Professors , and formulations of statements by that association either alone or in conjunction with the Association of American Colleges . These comments represent the attempt of the two associations , as the original sponsors of the 1940 \u201c Statement , \u201d to formulate the most important of these refinements . Their incorporation here as Interpretive Comments is based upon the premise that the 1940 \u201c Statement \u201d is not a static code but a fundamental document designed to set a framework of norms to guide adaptations to changing times and circumstances . Also , there have been relevant developments in the law itself reflecting a growing insistence by the courts on due process within the academic community which parallels the essential concepts of the 1940 \u201c Statement \u201d ; particularly relevant is the identification by the Supreme Court of academic freedom as a right protected by the First Amendment . As the Supreme Court said in Keyishian v. Board of Regents , 385 US 589 ( 1967 ) , \u201c Our Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom , which is of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the teachers concerned . That freedom is therefore a special concern of the First Amendment , which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom . \u201d Back to text . 2 . The word \u201c teacher \u201d as used in this document is understood to include the investigator who is attached to an academic institution without teaching duties . Back to text . 3 . First 1970 comment : The Association of American Colleges and the American Association of University Professors have long recognized that membership in the academic profession carries with it special responsibilities . Both associations either separately or jointly have consistently affirmed these responsibilities in major policy statements , providing guidance to professors in their utterances as citizens , in the exercise of their responsibilities to the institution and to students , and in their conduct when resigning from their institution or when undertaking government - sponsored research . Of particular relevance is the \u201c Statement on Professional Ethics \u201d adopted in 1966 as Association policy ( AAUP , Policy Documents and Reports , 11th ed. [ Baltimore : Johns Hopkins University Press , 2015 ] , 145 \u2013 46 ) . Back to text . 4 . Second 1970 comment : The intent of this statement is not to discourage what is \u201c controversial . \u201d Controversy is at the heart of the free academic inquiry which the entire statement is designed to foster . The passage serves to underscore the need for teachers to avoid persistently intruding material which has no relation to their subject . Back to text . 5 . Third 1970 comment : Most church - related institutions no longer need or desire the departure from the principle of academic freedom implied in the 1940 \u201c Statement , \u201d and we do not now endorse such a departure . Back to text . 6 . Fourth 1970 comment : This paragraph is the subject of an interpretation adopted by the sponsors of the 1940 \u201c Statement \u201d immediately following its endorsement : If the administration of a college or university feels that a teacher has not observed the admonitions of paragraph 3 of the section on Academic Freedom and believes that the extramural utterances of the teacher have been such as to raise grave doubts concerning the teacher 's fitness for his or her position , it may proceed to file charges under paragraph 4 of the section on Academic Tenure . In pressing such charges , the administration should remember that teachers are citizens and should be accorded the freedom of citizens . In such cases the administration must assume full responsibility , and the American Association of University Professors and the Association of American Colleges are free to make an investigation . Paragraph 3 of the section on Academic Freedom in the 1940 \u201c Statement \u201d should also be interpreted in keeping with the <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Place\": [], \"Agent\": [\"the American Association of University Professors\", \"the Association of American Colleges\"], \"Cause\": [\"as the 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure\"], \"Range_of_options\": [\"Academic Freedom\"], \"Characteristic\": [\"not to introduce into their teaching controversial matter which has no relation to their subject\"], \"Time\": [\"1940\"]}"}

It is available around the world , including on the US DirecTV satellite platform and Britain 's SKY . In 2008 , the network hosted 1,800 visitors to Israel\u00c2 for \u201c A Celebration of Israel 's 60th Anniversary \u201d in the Old City of Jerusalem . A year later , it reportedly partnered with the Jewish National Fund ( JNF ) to plant half - a- million dollars worth of trees in the Negev . https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=niTfqPdRQE8 Rory Alec issued a statement last month acknowledging that \u201c After 20 years of service , I have had a moral failure this year . For this reason , I am stepping down . \u201d Calling himself \u201c an imperfect man , \u201d he added : \u201c It is with a heavy heart that I confirm my season with God TV is over for now . \u201d His name no longer appears on the network 's online \u00c2 leadership \u00c2 list . Wendy Alec told viewers that \u00e2 The princes of hell designed a perfect strategy \u201d to seduce her husband , indicating he had been led astray while producing a jazz album for his new love . \u00e2 It was a real strategic attack against his mind \u2026 The music studio is one of the most seductive environments you can have . \u00e2 She herself had never had an affair , she said , and she also denied that the couple had lived a lavish lifestyle . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Resulting_action\": [\"left her for a jazz musician\"], \"Manipulator\": [\"the devil\"], \"Goods\": [\"her marriage\"], \"Victim\": [\"Rory\"], \"Time\": [\"this year\"], \"Place\": [\"The music studio\"]}"}

Copulation takes place when a mature male hops onto the back of a mature female and <event> grips <\/event> her body with his legs . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> | Locust handbook | | 2 . Desert Locust-Schistocerca gregaria| The life cycle comprises three stages : egg , hopper , adult ( Fig. 12 ) . The time spent in each stage varies considerably depending on the weather . This is discussed in more detail in the the section on seasonal movements and breeding areas ( page 36 ) . Immature adults Immature adults are usually pink , lighter or darker according to whether the locusts have been bred under high or low temperatures . The bright pink may change to a brownish red if the locusts have spent more than two months in this immature stage . Maturation Desert Locusts may become sexually mature in a few weeks or a few months , according to environmental circumstances . In unfavourable weather and food conditions , as for instance when they are subjected to low temperatures and drought , maturation may take as long as six months . If they have the right kind of food and weather , maturation can take place rapidly in 2 - 4 weeks . The exact conditions that cause locusts to mature are not known but the process is usually associated with the start of the rainy season . Male locusts start to mature first and then give off from their skin a chemical substance the odour of which causes maturation to start in females , and also in any males in which it has not already begun . The beginning of maturation can be recognised by the disappearance of the pink colour from the hind tibia . At this stage yolk is deposited in the eggs . It is at this stage that the eggs present in the female locusts begin to accumulate yolk and as they grow to full size over the next week the abdomens of the females become distended . Mature adults The mature adult is yellow , the males being a brighter yellow than the females . The ovaries of the female locusts contain eggs which can easily be seen if the abdomen is pulled away from the thorax . At this stage large swarms break up into smaller ones , as those locusts that mature first settle on the ground for breeding , while those not yet quite mature fly on . Copulation This is the mating act . The male jumps on the back of the female and holds on to her with the front pair of legs ( Fig. 13 ) . The tips of their abdomens come into contact and the male sex cells ( spermatozoa ) are passed into the body of the female where they fertilise the eggs . The time spent in copulation varies from 3 to 14 h. Several females can be fertilised by one male and the spermatozoa can be stored inside the female 's body and used to fertilise more than one set of eggs . Sometimes there are many more males than females in a mature swarm and then fighting occurs amongst the males for possession of females . Laying and eggs When copulation ends the males usually remain for some time on the backs of the females . The females become restless and walk about carrying the males . They begin to select a suitable place to lay their eggs by probing and testing the soil with the tip of the abdomen . During this probing they can detect warmth , hardness , moisture and salinity ( salt content ) of the soil . They are also attracted to each other at this time , assembling together in groups . Selection of laying places then depends partly on the soil conditions and vegetation and partly on the presence of other locusts . Laying can occur at all times of day and night provided that the soil surface does not become too hot or too cold , and that the soil is moist , at least below the surface . Laying can also occur in a wide range of soil types varying from quite coarse sand to silty clays , but the female must be able to dig into the soil with the extremity of her abdomen . Generally the top layer , about 6 cm deep , is dry , and there is a layer of damp soil below . This must be sufficiently deep to take all the eggs , that is , about 4 cm . When a suitable place is found the female pushes the ovipositor into the soil and makes a hole . The abdomen stretches to about twice its normal length and the eggs are laid ( Fig. 14 ) . The whole process of probing , digging and laying takes 1.5 - 2 h. A copulating and laying swarm usually stays in the same area for 1 - 2 days . Sometimes copulation occurs with females which appear not to be fully mature , that is , females in which the eggs are not fully developed . Mature female locusts often dig holes without laying eggs in them , even though the soil conditions appear to be suitable . The reasons for this behaviour are not known . On occasions females have been seen to lay eggs on the surface of the ground or on trees . This is usually because the soil is too hard and dry . Once eggs are fully developed inside the female she can only keep them for about 3 days ; then they must be laid whether suitable soil is available or not . Eggs laid on the soil surface or on trees do not hatch . Abnormal laying of this kind , especially when on a large scale , constitutes important information and should be either mentioned in the routine locust reports , or reported separately . Female locusts lay many eggs at a time and these are bound together by a frothy secretion which forms them into an egg pod ( Fig. 15 ) . The egg pod is 3 - 4 cm long , the bottom being usually about 10 cm down in the soil . On top of the eggs the frothy substance hardens to form a plug which extends almost to the surface of the soil . The plug helps to prevent the eggs drying and it also provides a medium through which the young hoppers can easily reach the surface when they hatch . Egg pods are nearly always laid in groups , which may be either large or small . It is useful to record the maximum density in one square foot . The area over which egg pods are laid , which varies from a few square metres to a square kilometre or more , is called an egg field . The number of eggs in a pod can vary from about 20 to over 100 but the number for swarming locusts is usually between 70 and 80 for the first laying , between 60 and 70 for the second laying and less than 50 for the third laying , if it occurs . It is noteworthy that the egg pods of locusts not in swarms usually contain many more eggs than pods laid by swarming locusts . Three is probably the maximum number of egg pods laid by swarming locusts in the field , but those kept in laboratories can lay many more . There is some evidence that in the field non-swarming locusts lay more pods than swarming ones , about five on average . When the eggs are laid they are yellow in colour but in the soil they turn brown . They absorb water from the soil , about their own weight of water in the first five days if it is available at the time , and this is enough to allow them to develop successfully . Research has shown that 20 mm of water is sufficient . If they do not get this quantity of water they will not hatch . If , however , there is not sufficient water in the soil during the first few days , they can absorb as much as the supply permits and then wait for several days before taking in the remainder , after more rain has fallen . It is not possible for Desert Locust eggs to stay dry in the ground from one rainy season to the next and then hatch when the rain comes . Incubation period and hatching The period of egg development , between laying and hatching , is called the incubation period . The rate at which eggs develop varies according to the soil temperature . For example , in the summer breeding areas of West Africa , the Red Sea coast and lowland India the incubation period takes 10 - 14 days but this is extended to 25 - 30 days in the cooler spring breeding areas of central Arabia , southern Iran and Pakistan while in North Africa it can take as long as 70 days in exceptionally cold weather . More detailed information can be found in the section on seasonal movements and breeding areas ( Page 36 ) . When they are fully developed in the eggs , the young hoppers burst their way out of the egg shells , wriggle up the froth tube to the surface , and immediately shed a thin white skin . These white skins are easily visible on the surface of the soil and are an indication that hatching has recently taken place . They are , however , soon blown away by the wind . Hatching takes place either shortly before or within 3 h of sunrise , and all the hoppers from one egg pod normally hatch on the same morning . It usually takes three days for the complete hatching of a whole egg field but longer periods have been recorded . Only a few hoppers hatch on the first of these days , most on the second and a few more on the third . Hoppers When hatching is complete , some small and some larger groups of hoppers will be noticed all over the egg field . Sometimes there is very little movement of hoppers on the first day of hatching but after a day or two the groups of hoppers will have joined together to form larger groups which move about ; these are called bands . Moulting By the time they are a day old the hoppers have started to feed . Their skin is hard and tough by now and will only stretch a little . They therefore have to grow by casting off their skins from time to time . This process is called moulting . When the hopper sheds its old skin it has a new , soft skin underneath . This stretches for a short time , allowing the hopper to grow , before it hardens . Moulting usually occurs five times during the development of the Desert Locust ( apart from the skin-shedding that occurs at hatching ) . Instars The hopper stage of the life cycle is thus divided into five instars . ( Hoppers are sometimes called nymphs and the hopper instars are then called nymphal instars . The word ' stage ' is occasionally used instead of ' instar ' in locust reports , e.g. ' fifth - stage hoppers ' ; it should , however , be restricted to the three main stages of the life cycle , egg , hopper and adult . ) Figures 16 - 22 show the distinctions between the different instars of the Desert Locust . The first instar is whitish in colour when newly hatched but in 1 - 2 h turns mainly black . As it grows bigger and becomes ready for moulting a pale colour pattern becomes more obvious . It is not always easy to distinguish the second instar from the first but with experience one recognises that the pale colour pattern is more obvious and that the head is much larger . It is easily distinguished from the third instar because there is no sign yet of wing growth . The third instar is easily recognised by the two pairs of wing ' buds ' which can be seen projecting from underneath the pronotum on each side of the thorax . The colour now is conspicuously black and yellow , more black in <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Place\": [\"on the ground\"], \"Agent\": [\"The male\"], \"Entity\": [\"the back of the female\"], \"Bodypart_of_agent\": [\"with the front pair of legs\"]}"}

Amid the 1969 Northern Ireland riots , which would lead to the Troubles , nationalist families were being forced from their homes , and refugees \" <event> streamed <\/event> over the border \" into the Republic . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> IN 1969 , REFUGEES from Northern Ireland began to stream across the border to the Republic to escape the violence of the Troubles . How the State reacted to this is detailed in documents released in a file in the 1984 State Papers . The memorandum for the Government on catering for Northern Refugees was sent to them on 26 January 1973 , accompanying a bill for the care of displaced persons . The memo reveals : - The number of refugees was unprecedented - Some refugees were ' demanding ' - Local authorities butted heads with the Department of Defence - Some refugees thought they were going on ' holiday ' The document details how refugees were put up in more and more army camps as the \u201c refugee problem \u201d grew . \u201c Streaming \u201d over the border The memo states that the problem \u201c erupted \u201d when refugees \u201c streamed over the border \u201d from the North in August 1969 . It was decided that the army authorities would house and feed all refugees in two camps , Gormanston and Finner , and other centres would be opened in necessary . The Irish Red Cross was charged with collecting money and relief supplies for the refugees . It also supplied them with pocket money and gave them food , clothing , washing machines , first aid , organised school buses , brought patients to hospital and more . The Red Cross paid for all the transport and the free travel vouchers people were given to return to their homes . Counties \u201c convenient to the border \u201d were alerted to the possibility that if large numbers of refugees continued to arrive , local authorities would have to get involved . \u201c Ominous numbers \u201d of refugees Then in the summer of 1970 , more refugees arrived . While 720 arrived in 1969 , the peak figure in 1970 was 1,558 . In July 1971 , refugees arrived \u201c in somewhat ominous numbers \u201d , but by the second week of August 1971 , they began to arrive in \u201c unprecedented numbers \u201d and the capacity of army refugee centres at Gormanston , Finner , Kilworth , Coolmoney , Kildare , Kilkenny , Waterford , and Tralee were soon greatly exceeded . The Minister had to call on the local authorities for help , and communities and religious leaders put their facilities and services at the refugees ' disposal . - Six hundred refugees were even accommodated for a short time at the training depot in Templemore by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na . - At its peak , 1,695 people were being catered for by the Army , and 2,714 outside of army centres . It was even allowed that civil servants who were members of organisations like the Civil Defence and Irish Red Cross could be granted special leave to give their time voluntarily to help . Local authorities asked to step in Then , in 1972 , it was decided \u201c for military reasons \u201d that the army would not be asked to look after any future refugees , so local authorities were asked to make contingency plans . \u201c Every Local Authority was expected to take a quota of refugees , \u201d says the memo . The Health Boards were asked to help , and the responsibility for general direction and co-ordination of the refugees rested with the Department of Defence 's Civil Defence Branch . The Vote for Defence bore any costs , except transport and \u201c comforts \u201d , which the Irish Red Cross looked after . Nearly 10,000 refugees in 1972 In 1972 , more refugees arrived , and the number did n't go below the 2000 mark until August of that year . \u201c Approximately 9,800 refugees in all were handled during the months of July and August 1972 , \u201d says the memo . The operation was a major one , but was \u201c accomplished with considerable smoothness \u201d . Each year 's influx of refugees brought \u201c with it a number of social problems cases who would be misfits no matter where they were \u201d , says the memo . Another difficulty was \u201c casual people \u201d arriving and declaring themselves refugees . The memo warns that \u201c many who have no good reason to leave their homes in the North inevitably do \u201d . It also says that as long as there was unrest , there was the possibility of refugees . \u201c Ungrateful \u201d refugees The memo notes that the first refugees , from 1969 \u2013 1971 , came due to fears about their personal safety : most of them came on the spur of the moment and in great haste , bringing with them only what they wore . By 1972 , this had changed . \u201c The refugees on this occasion had obviously made preparations in advance for a holiday in the South , \u201d says the memo , adding most of the children had swimming gear , tennis racquets and fishing rods in their possession . It describes how in Waterford , one group reported they were not actually refugees but \u201c had understood that they were being sent down on a holiday to hotels , private houses , etc \u201d \u2013 and there were similar stories coming from Cork and Dublin . It was reported that groups were collecting money for thes \u201c holidays \u201d . There were worries this situation could be \u201c exploited by extremists \u201d or unscrupulous people . Refugees are not always just frightened people who are thankful for the assistance being given them . Some of them can be very demanding and ungrateful , even obstreperous and fractious \u2013 as well as , particularly in the case of teenage boys , destructive . But irrespective of their attitudes , government policy \u201c has been interpreted \u2026 as requiring that they should all be accepted without question and treated to the best of our ability as groups of Irish people in need of help at a very difficult time \u201d . It also notes that due to the \u201c holiday \u201d reports , \u201c the reality of the need of the refugees for a respite from the unnerving atmosphere of the North was not always fully appreciated locally \u201d . The memo details fears that there could be a \u201c major crisis situation arising at any time of the year involving numbers of refugees vastly in excess of anything experienced hitherto \u201d . This situation could even lead to closing all boarding ( and perhaps other ) schools \u2013 it was discussed that powers of compulsory acquisition of accommodation on a temporary basis might become essential . The Minister for Defence drafted a general scheme of a bill to enable legislation to be drafted and held , in case the temporary acquisition of accommodation for refugees was needed . With no legal onus on local authorities to look after refugees , it was \u201c only by the exercise of much persuasion and tact on the part of the Civil Defence controlling staff in the Department of Defence that all County Managers were eventually prevailed upon to undertake responsibility for the accommodation and care of Northern refugees \u201d . \u201c They appear to convey the impression that they are being unduly imposed upon in this matter \u201d , says the document . But the Minister for Defence felt that if any special legislation in relation to Northern refugees was introduced , it should also provide for the imposition on Local Authorities the duty to provide for their accommodation , maintenance and welfare .

( Haaretz ) Israel files a complaint with the UN Security Council and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan , urging the international community to enforce council resolutions calling on the Lebanese government to disarm all militias within its borders and to extend its authority throughout its territory and specifically to southern Lebanon and its border with Israel . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> DAMASCUS - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert described what is happening in Lebanon as saying . \" This is an act of war . \" Olmert is correct . This is war . It has been war , non-stop , since 1948 . What is happening in Lebanon today is yet another chapter of bloody Middle East events that will last for generations to come , because it is impossible , after so many years of conflict , for the Israelis and Arabs to forgive and forget . In this week 's events in Lebanon , the one set of parties , which include Syria , the Palestinians , Iran , Arab nationalists in the Middle East and North Africa , along with jihadi Muslims in the Muslim World , believe that escalation is the only solution to the Arab -Israeli conflict . They claim that the Arabs tried to talk peace with the Israelis after the Palestinians signed a peace agreement with Israel in 1993 , and ended up with nothing . They say that war is correct , justified morally , politically and religiously . To them , it is legitimate self -defense . They back this argument by saying that Israel still controls the Sheba Farms , which are part of Lebanon , and still has Lebanese prisoners in Israeli jails . Also , they add that the Israeli tank destroyed by Hezbollah , and the soldiers captured and killed on July 12 , had trespassed into Lebanon 's side of the border with Israel . They argue that if the Arab world cannot fight Israel , then the least Arab countries can do is permit - or facilitate - a proxy war with Israel through the Hezbollah resistance in Lebanon . US President George W Bush , who commented on Lebanon from Germany 24 hours after violence had spiraled out of control , described the situation as \" pathetic \" . He also expressed concern that Israel 's offensive into Lebanon could destabilize or even topple a Lebanese government that Washington supports . He made things worse and further infuriated the Arab street by expressing Israel 's \" right to defend herself \" . The other party ( centered mainly in Lebanon ) argues that Lebanon is paying a high price for a war that does not concern all Lebanese . The Christians of Lebanon , along with a majority of the Sunni Muslims , want a war- free Westernized country that thrives on tourism and sound economic policies . The Christians in particular were never too fond of the Shi'ites of Lebanon . They treated them as an underclass in the 1950s and 1960s , allocating no more than 0.7 % of the budget for construction and health care in their districts , waged war against them in the 1970s and 1980s , then tried to mend relations with them from 1990 onwards . The Christians were worldly , well - educated and worked in business , politics , literature and the arts , while the Shi'ites were mainly laborers , farmers and ordinary citizens with limited social mobility . Even their deputies in parliament were feudal landlords who cared little for the community 's welfare . These Christians today - despite all the unity talk heard in Lebanon - do not feel that the Hezbollah prisoners in Israeli jails concern them . Nor do the Sheba Farms . They dislike the Shi'ite south of the country in as much as the Shi'ite leaders dislike the Christian districts of Lebanon . Therefore , they feel indifferent to the plight of Hezbollah . They do not want Lebanon to become the \" Che Guevara \" of Arab politics . They argue that all this military escalation does is wreck plans for Lebanon 's rebirth . On July 13 - as the Christians feared - tourism suffered tremendously after the Israelis struck at Beirut Airport . In one day , over 15,000 tourists fled Lebanon by land to Syria . Both pro and anti-Hezbollah arguments are valid , depending on where one stands today in the Arab world . It all started on July 12 when Israel troops were ambushed on Lebanon 's side of the border with Israel . Hezbollah , which commands the Lebanese south , immediately seized on their crossing . They arrested two Israeli soldiers , killed eight Israelis and wounded over 20 in attacks inside Israeli territory . This unleashed hell in Israel , and Olmert immediately responded by mounting a war on Lebanon . A sea , air and ground blockade was enforced on Lebanon , and a systematic destruction of Lebanon 's infrastructure was began . Hezbollah responded by wounding 11 Israelis with Katyusha - style rockets fired on the town of Safad in northern Israel . Hezbollah secretary general Hassan Nasrallah gave a press conference hours after the hostilities started . He was confident , articulate , strong and very defiant , as usual , saying that this operation aimed at getting the Israelis to release Lebanese prisoners from their jails . Counter-operations would not release the two abducted Israeli soldiers , he pointed out . Statements by Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad al - Siniora , who wanted to distance himself from the attacks , said that his government had not authorized the Hezbollah operation . His claim , however , fell on deaf ears in Israel . Damaging his credibility was a statement by Lebanon 's ambassador to the United States , Farid Abbud , who spoke on CNN and demanded a prisoner exchange between Hezbollah and Israel , adding that Israel must return the occupied Sheba Farms to Lebanon . His statements gave the impression that the Lebanese government , which he was officially representing , approved of the kidnapping and was echoing the demands of Nasrallah . As a result , he was recalled to Lebanon . Undaunted by Siniora distancing himself from the Hezbollah operation , Israel responded by bombing Rafik al - Harriri International Airport in Beirut , bringing all aviation to a halt , and bombing two other airports in northern and southern Lebanon . These airports , Israel claimed , were being used to channel money and arms to Hezbollah . One of the party 's offices in the suburb of Beirut was bombed , and so was a post in the ancient city of Baalbak . And Israel battered roads , flyovers and fuel tanks in Lebanon early on Friday . A division of 12,000 troops has been stationed on the Lebanese - Israeli border . The Israeli Ministry of Defense has threatened to bomb the Damascus - Beirut highway . If this happens , Lebanon would become completely isolated , with no ground route to Syria , and its other outlets by sea and air blocked by the Israeli Defense Forces ( IDF ) . Hezbollah threatened that if more attacks ensued , it would target Haifa , the third - largest city inside Israel ( which it then did ) , but Israel military commanders said that no targets in Lebanon were safe from reprisal attacks so long as the two Israeli soldiers were still held hostage in Lebanon . Israeli chief - of - staff Dan Halutz said that the operations would continue \" to restore calm to northern Israel \" . These responsibilities , he added \" particularly bombings by air and artillery , target Lebanon itself and Hezbollah . They will continue as long as necessary until our objectives are reached . \" Israel military commanders have pledged to plunge Lebanon back 20 years if hostilities did not end immediately . Bridges inside Lebanon , near the city of Sidon and throughout the south , were also destroyed . The death toll , at the time of writing , is over 50 Lebanese killed . Another 103 have been wounded . Meanwhile , according to the IDF , 90 people had been injured inside Israel . This is the largest Israeli offensive in Lebanon since the IDF invaded and occupied Beirut to defeat the Palestinian Army of Yasser Arafat in 1982 . Apart from all of these facts , everything gets muddled in Lebanon . Israel announced on July 13 that two rockets had landed on Haifa from Lebanon , as Hezbollah had promised , but Hezbollah denied the accusation . If Hezbollah did not fire the rockets , however , who did ? Is it a fabricated story being used by Israel to launch more offensives into Lebanon , because minutes after the story was revealed , and despite Hezbollah 's denial , Israel jets raided fuel tanks at Beirut airport . The question on everybody 's mind is : why is all of this happening now ? Apart from the soaring emotions and reminders of trumpeting Arab nationalism of the 1960s , it is sheer madness for anyone to believe that Hezbollah would be able to defeat , or even inflict maximum pain , on Israel - and get away with it . Too much is at stake inside Israel for Olmert to let the offensive pass without transforming it into all - out war . In October 2000 , right at the outbreak of the second Palestinian uprising in Jerusalem , Hezbollah did a similar stunt by kidnapping Israelis in Lebanon . At the time , prime minister Ehud Barak refused to seriously push for their release , fearing that opening another front against Lebanon , while the Israelis were busy combating the Palestinians at home , would only endanger Israeli lives . Five months later , Barak was voted out of office , in March 2001 , for a variety of reasons , prime among them being his passive response to Hezbollah . So , is anybody influencing Hezbollah to dramatically escalate the conflict ? Has Hezbollah coordinated these attacks with Hamas inside Palestine , believing that the time was ripe since relatively new and inexperienced leaders were now in power in Israel ( in reference to Defense Minister Amir Peretz and Olmert ) ? Never before has Hezbollah carried out such a massive offensive , not even during the heydays of the Syrian presence in Lebanon in the 1990s when most of south Lebanon was still occupied . What makes it believe that this time - with the tense international situation - it can get away with it ? Ultra-nationalists in Hamas , like the Damascus - based Khaled Meshal , have certainly supported the Lebanese group , injecting them with confidence and prompting them into \" defiance \" mode . Meshal , who leads the anti-pragmatism fold in Hamas that still wants to destroy the Jewish state , is not satisfied by the overtures of Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyya towards Israel . Haniyya , voted into office early this year , wants to run a country and is suffering from an international boycott on food , medicine and money into the Palestinian territories . Wages have not been paid in Palestine since February . Haniyya made several gestures of goodwill toward Israel ( much to the displeasure of Meshal ) , to prove that he was not in power to combat Israel but to improve the livelihood of the Palestinians . Meshal had other plans for the Hamas- led government , which contradicted with what Haniyya was seeing on the ground in Palestine . The two men drifted apart on how to lead the government , and split when three resistance groups in Palestine , apparently coordinating with Meshal 's team , kidnapped the 19 - year old Israeli soldier on June 25 . This sent shockwaves throughout Israel , and Olmert responded with grand force , re-occupying Gaza and killing , to date , an estimated 75 Palestinians in revenge . Electricity was destroyed in Gaza , and currently 1.5 million inhabitants live in darkness . Israel struck at buildings , an Islamic university and official buildings , including that of Haniyya and his Foreign Minister Mahmud al - Zahhar ( which was destroyed on July 13 ) . Ministers have been arrested , along with parliamentary deputies , and brought before military courts clad in chains to their feet and hands .

It narrated the stories of the lives of six bomb survivors from immediately prior to , and months after , the <event> dropping <\/event> of the Little Boy bomb . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> In 1946 , just after the first anniversary of the destruction of Hiroshima , \u201c The New Yorker \u201d magazine 's Aug. 31 issue published the complete text of John Hersey 's portrait of the atom bomb and its effects on the Japanese city . At the end of the war , in 1945 , Hersey was in Japan writing about the reconstruction of the devastated country when he happened across an account written by a Jesuit priest who had survived the Hiroshima destruction . It was he who introduced the reporter to other survivors . From these , Hersey chose six individuals : two doctors , a minister , a widowed seamstress , a young woman who worked in a factory , and the priest himself . These became the principal characters in an account that melded nonfiction reportage with the stylistic devices of the novel , all expressed through the plainest of styles . \u201c On some undressed bodies , the burns had made patterns . . . the shapes of flowers they had had on their kimonos . \u201d A would - be rescuer took a victim by the hands \u201c but her skin slipped off in huge , glove - like pieces . \u201d One observer found 20 soldiers , \u201c their faces were wholly burned , their eye sockets were hollow , the fluid from their melted eyes had run down their cheeks . ( They must have had their faces upturned when the bomb went off ; perhaps they were anti-aircraft personnel . ) \u201d As one critic remarked : \u201c If ever there was a subject calculated to make a writer overwrought and a piece overwritten , it was the bombing of Hiroshima , yet Hersey 's reporting was so meticulous , his sentences and paragraphs were so clear , calm and restrained , that the horror the story had to tell comes through all the more chillingly , \u201d as in the passage , \u201c a great number sat and lay on the pavement , vomited , waited for death , and died . \u201d Later Hersey would say of this now celebrated style : \u201c I was right to adopt it . A high literary manner , or a show of passion , would have brought me into the story as a mediator . I wanted to avoid such mediation , so the reader 's experience would be as direct as possible . \u201d I certainly remember my experience , reading it in a battered ( and forbidden ) copy of \u201c The New Yorker . \u201d The magazine had been discouraged by the occupation authorities but a copy or two still circulated , samizdat -style , when I read it in Tokyo in January 1947 . The experience was direct ; the plainness of the style and the horror of the account both moved and shocked . Among those also experiencing shock were the top brass of American Gen. Douglas MacArthur 's SCAP ( the offices of the occupation ) . The supreme commander of the allied powers had strictly prohibited dissemination of any reports on the consequences of the bombings , and now look at what Hersey had done \u2014 spread it all over . The ban had extended to photos and movies \u2014 all copies were gotten out of the country and sent direct to Washington . Such censorship included scientific writings as well . Reports concerning the effect of the blast could not be made public until the closing months of the occupation . Thus for over six years , Japanese scientists were denied assess to data that might have assisted them in helping atomic-bomb victims . And when Takashi Nagai 's elegiac \u201c Bells of Nagasaki \u201d was first published in Japan , General Willoughby insisted that an American - constructed appendix on \u201c The Sack of Manila \u201d be included . ( Though its inclusion could easily be taken as suggesting that Nagasaki and Manila were comparable atrocities \u2014 hardly , as historian John Dower has noted , what the Americans intended . ) John Hersey 's \u201c Hiroshima \u201d did not appear in Japanese translation until 1949 . But it was never again out of print . In 1985 , the American edition added a new chapter , \u201c The Aftermath , \u201d which tells readers what became of the six survivors Hersey wrote about . It is this edition that is here reissued in this new Penguin version , making again available what has been called \u201c the most celebrated piece of journalism to come out of World War II \u201d and one in which we find the most compassionate answer to that war 's most notorious atrocity .

After World War II , a new generation viewed himalong with P. G. Wodehouseas the last , slightly ridiculous vestige of the frivolous ' 20s . Country houses , stiff upper lips , cocktails - and - laughter - but - oh - what - comes - after and all that . Many of his plays flopped in the ' 40s and ' 50s and his fortunes sagged , although with typical resilience he embarked on a successful new venture as a cabaret performer in the ' 50s . It was in the ' 60s that his best work , with its inspired inconsequentiality , seemed to exert not only a period charm but charm , period . Five years ago , a new production of Hay Fever ( 1924 ) by Olivier 's National Theater Company set off a flurry of revivals and re-evaluations . The times seemed right for a look back at gaiety , and soon the brittle sophisticate of legend , clenching a cigarette holder and dashing off pages of decadent dialogue before breakfast , had become the grand old man of the English theater . INTERVIEWER : You always gave the press plenty to talk about . COWARD : Certainly I did . I acted up like crazy . I did everything that was expected of me . Part of the job . Coward 's greatest single gift has not been writing or composing , not acting or directing , but projecting a sense of personal style , a combination of cheek and chic , pose and poise . He had it as a newcomer of 25 , when he walked into a fashionable party where all but he were in formal dress , took in the situation at a glance and said reassuringly : \" Now I do n't want anyone to feel embarrassed . \" He has it still , dapper in a brown dinner jacket , hand elegantly holding aloft the perpetual cigarette , answering a request for a definition of the perfect life with a single word : \" Mine . \" The public personality that is built on this sense of style is Coward 's one great creation , looming behind all his smaller ones and investing them with special effervescence . This is what John Osborne meant when he said that Coward \" is his own invention and contribution to this century . \" This is what makes it idle to scan the man or his works for the \" real \" Noel Coward . The mask of supreme entertainer has become the man . With Coward 's 70th birthday , the legend is sealed . As Carlyle said of the universe , we had best accept itas gratefully as Coward does . INTERVIEWER : I hope you have n't been bored having to go through all these interviews for your birthday , having to answer the same old questions about yourself . COWARD : Not at all . I 'm fascinated by the subject .

One is that it comes from Haupipi , who arrived in New Zealand <event> on <\/event> the Aotea canoe , after his first canoe , Kurahaup\u014d , was wrecked . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> E rere kau mai te awa nui nei Mai i te k\u0101hui maunga ki Tangaroa Ko au te awa Ko te awa ko au . The river flows From the mountains to the sea I am the river The river is me . Kupe Legendary Polynesian navigator Kupe 's early exploration of New Zealand is commemorated in many ancient place names . Kupe landed at Whanganui , known as Te Kaihau - o - Kupe , or ' Kupe 's wind - eating ' , because of the constant winds there . He then took his canoe upriver in search of inhabitants , paddling as far as Kauarap\u0101oa . This was named for one of his men , Arap\u0101oa , who drowned swimming across the river in flood . It is told that although Kupe heard the bird calls of weka , k\u014dkako and p\u012bwakawaka ( fantail ) , he did not find people . He returned to the river mouth and then made his way to P\u0101tea in south Taranaki , where he planted karaka seed in its sweet soils . Turi and Ng\u0101 Paerangi On returning to Hawaiki in Polynesia , Kupe described his explorations to his people . Some time later , Turi , captain of the Aotea canoe , sailed to P\u0101tea , where he made his home . According to tradition , his descendants who spread into the region discovered the original people of the land , Ng\u0101 Paerangi . The chief Paerangi , from whom they took their name , is said to have preceded Turi by five generations . The collective name for the people of the river , Ng\u0101ti Hau , is in some versions said to have come from Haupipi . He sailed with Turi on the Aotea after his original canoe , the Kuruhaup\u014d , was wrecked . In other versions the name is a contraction of Te \u0100ti Haunui-a- P\u0101p\u0101rangi ( the people of Haunui-a- P\u0101p\u0101rangi ) . Haunui-a- P\u0101p\u0101rangi also arrived with Turi , and his descendants settled among the people of Ng\u0101 Paerangi . Tamatea Another significant ancestor is Tamatea - p\u014dkai - whenua , captain of the T\u0101kitimu canoe and explorer of the Whanganui River . When entering the river Tamatea sent his servant ashore to find flax for a topknot ( p\u016btiki ) . The place where flax was found became known as Te P\u016btiki-wharanui- a- Tamatea - p\u014dkai - whenua . Turi came to visit Tamatea , and his daughter T\u0101neroa fell in love and married Tamatea 's brother , Uenga-ariki . How the Whanganui River was formed In ancient times three mountains , Ruapehu , Tongariro and Taranaki , lived together in the centre of the North Island , the fish which M\u0101ui hauled from the sea . One day Taranaki attempted to carry off P\u012bhanga , the wife of Tongariro . In the ensuing battle Taranaki was defeated and escaped down to Whanganui . As he fled , he carved out the deep furrow of the river . The place where he eventually stopped in loneliness is the site of Mt Taranaki today . Tamatea then built a canoe , and left his servant at the mouth of the river , while he explored upriver . According to some , this event gave rise to its name , Whanganui ( from ' whanga nui ' , meaning ' long wait ' ) . Others say the name came from Haunui-a- P\u0101p\u0101rangi , and meant ' great harbour ' . Children of Tamakehu and Ruaka Tamakehu , a Te \u0100ti Haunui- a- P\u0101p\u0101rangi chief , and his first wife Ruaka had three children : Hineng\u0101kau of the upper river , Tama \u016apoko , who settled in the middle reaches , and T\u016bpoho , associated with the lower Whanganui . Their names are regularly invoked to express the basic unity of the people . This is also emphasised by certain sayings , such as 'te taura whiri a Hineng\u0101kau ' ( ' the plaited rope of Hineng\u0101kau ' ) which refers to the ties between the people of the river . Other canoes Because the river 's path from the central North Island 's volcanic plateau is gradual and navigable over about 230 km , not only were some 80 p\u0101 and village sites built along its banks and cliffs , it also became one of the great arterial routes through the central North Island . This has ensured that other tribes , such as those of the Tainui confederation , Ng\u0101ti Raukawa and Ng\u0101ti Maniapoto , as well as Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu of the T\u0101kitimu canoe and Ng\u0101ti T\u016bwharetoa of the Arawa canoe , also contribute to the genealogical history of the river . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Source\": [], \"Path\": [], \"Area\": [], \"Place\": [], \"Goal\": [\"New Zealand\"], \"Driver\": [\"Haupipi\"], \"Vehicle\": [\"the Aotea\"], \"Time\": [\"after his original canoe , the Kuruhaup\\u014d , was wrecked\"]}"}

The birthmother of this innovative concept is Wheelys , the same Swedish company that introduced the infamous traveling bike cafes . Un-manned convenience store concepts have also popped up in countries like the US and Japan over the years , and e-commerce giant Amazon has introduced Amazon Go stores with a similar concept of using technology to keep track of products , identify the consumer , and allow a human - free shopping experience . Moby and BingoBox are not the only human- free stores in China .

To enter BingoBox , one must use WeChat to scan a QR code and punch in a verification code . Once inside the store , you can browse through an assortment of regular convenience store offerings : cold drinks , snacks , umbrellas and , of course , alcohol . According to a spokesperson , they 'll be adding imported food to their product mix in the coming weeks . After choosing your items for purchase , you will place all of the items ( a maximum of five ) at the checkout counter , where the machine can scan a tag on the item . A cool safety feature of BingoBox is a sensor that can tell if all of the items you have with you have been paid for . If you have an item that you did n't pay for , or if you forgot an item at the checkout counter , the door will stay locked until you have the appropriate number of items . Theft is therefore all but impossible , and if you attempt to leave BingoBox with any unpaid items , an alarm will sound off . But what if something goes wrong and you are locked inside ? Well , in order to enter you must have a smartphone , so if by chance something does go wrong , you will be able to call and report the problem . During the first week of opening , Auchan employees were monitoring the store to ensure everything ran smoothly , but once operations are back on track , the only human beings inside the store will be customers .

UK Anime Network on the other hand found Rebuild 's Asuka a more human and easier to <event> empathize <\/event> with character than the one of the classic series . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> It 's been almost a year now since I first got to see the second Rebuild of Evangelion movie in its Evangelion 2.0 format courtesy of a screening at the BFI Anime Weekend in London , and since that time I 've watched it again numerous times via other theatrical screenings and its Japanese Blu -Ray release . It probably says more about the film than anything else I 'm about to write that , despite all those previous viewings , I still clutched UK Anime 's review copy of Manga Entertainment 's Evangelion 2.22 release to my chest upon its arrival and simply refused to let it out of my sight until everyone else backed down and let me take up reviewing duties for it . If the first movie in this four film series that reboots the franchise , Evangelion 1.11 : You Are ( Not ) Alone , suggested that the entire project was going to be little more than an attempt to give the classic anime TV series a 21st century makeover for a new generation , then this second film dismisses any such thoughts utterly within moments of its introduction . Indeed , Evangelion 2.22 wastes no time at all in introducing us to a brand - new Evangelion pilot whose name is n't even mentioned to the viewer until her name crops up in the end credits - you 'll be wanting to make a mental note of her particulars however , for her sporadic appearances throughout the film punctuate some of its most important moments . It is n't just a new pilot that Evangelion 2.22 throws into the mix instantly , as the opening to the film also delivers a swift one - two punch of action set pieces ; the first featuring our mystery girl pitted against an Angel in a clunky prototype Evangelion unit , before we switch back to Japan and the appearance of the seventh Angel before its speedy dispatch by a certain Asuka Langley Shikinami . Yes , her surname might have changed but Asuka is back in the thick of things here , and as conceited as ever to boot - although that said , she is n't quite the character you might remember from her television outings , as we 'll discuss later . After thrilling the viewer with that sublime double - whammy of Angel -fighting action , the movie finally finds some time to take a breather and explore its characters and environment - Asuka 's appearance naturally features heavily here as she bounces off Shinji , Rei and Misato , while Ryoji Kagi also makes himself known throughout the movie as his efforts are sold to the highest bidder when he is n't ploughing his own furrow . These developments are whisked along on waves of alternating bouts of comedy and character interaction , and punctuated by another breath - taking effort to stop an Angel from wiping out humanity as we know it , this time via an opponent who is rather more familiar to fans of the TV show . We really have to stop and discuss character development at this point however , as it serves as arguably the biggest departure from the Evangelion of the 1990s . While the original shows main characters ( and particularly its roster of pilots ) were memorable in their own right , their characters remained broadly static as the series progresses , with revelations about their circumstances and pasts only serving to reinforce the motivations of each individual . In this regard , and following the trend touched upon in the first movie , You Can ( Not ) Advance is hugely different - all of its characters grow noticeably during the duration of the film as its subtitle alludes to , and this in turn works wonders in terms of making its individuals feel both more human and easier to empathise with . Yes , Shinji can still be a spoiled brat but his reasons for doing so feel utterly valid ; Rei is still a \" doll \" but one who is learning the importance of human emotion and the simple pleasures which come from being around others ; Asuka is feisty , arrogant and rude but allows others to close the emotional distance she exhibits towards them far more readily . Put more simply - Evangelion 2.22 's pilots feel more like real teenagers than caricatures of one . After a first half where things almost seem too relaxed on occasion , the second half of Evangelion 2.22 is where things really kick up a gear , complete with all of the political and organisational machinations that you might expect from the franchise with NERV at their centre . Against this backdrop , the film hits the viewer with everything that it has in its arsenal - visceral action , uncompromisingly horrific scenarios that send a shiver down your spine and an overflowing of emotion all lead up to a final half hour which almost delights in destroying everything from the viewer 's expectations through to their sense of sanity . You did n't really think Hideaki Anno was going to waste another opportunity to mess with your head , did you ? It 's really the second half of Evangelion 2.22 that showcases what this new series of films is all about - it 's a relentless and incredible spectacle , pure and simple , and it 's one that simply does n't get anything wrong in those terms . Never mind sitting on the edge of your seat , as the end credits roll you 'll realise that your fists are clenched , your eyes wide ; you 've just forgotten to breath or blink for the past hour , it seems . If the visuals of the first movie impressed you , then You Can ( Not ) Advance will drop your jaw to the floor with its almost perfect melding of CG and traditional animation techniques - it 's clear that this film was denied nothing in the pursuit of animated perfection , and given the time and money afforded it this is undoubtedly the best animated spectacle you will ever have seen as it builds up Tokyo III and then systemically destroys it in a riot of blood , guts and giant bio-mechanical creatures . This is backed up by an equally terrific soundtrack - Shiro Sagisu again works his magic and creates background music that feels both fresh and fitting ( even if some of it is lifted directly from His and Her Circumstances and given a dust - off ) , while Studio Khara do a number on the viewer by outfitting the film 's two most intense scenes with light , emotional songs about friendship and progress . The first will make you recoil in horror as it sharpens the knives on what is already a shocking scene ; the second will move you close to tears even if you are n't entirely sure what on earth is going on . Of course , music and visuals will only take you so far , so we really have to explicitly mention that this movie is a fantastic work in its own right via a script that knows when to ease off the throttle and when to put it hard to the floor , timing everything it does almost perfectly for the maximum impact - its slow , personal moments only serve to increase our discomfort when the characters we 've been close to are pushed into unbelievable peril , yet those moments of threatening apocalypse are necessarily lightened by those occasional moments of cheerful goofiness . This sense of light and shade rarely puts a foot wrong across the course of the film to create a viewing experience that is as equally satisfying cerebrally as it is a feast for your eyes and ears . In terms of Manga Entertainment 's UK release , we were lucky enough to check out the Blu-Ray version of the movie , and even more luckily for me I can sum it up in a single word - beautiful . Given the care and attention lavished upon the film itself by its creators , this digital transfer similarly gives the movie the love it deserves , and it absolutely looks the part from beginning to end coupled with a Dolby True HD 6.1 audio track that threatens to shake your house down during its more destructive moments ( or , as my next - door neighbour put it , \" there was a lot of screaming \" ) . As per the first film , the original TV anime 's English dub cast is reassembled to decent effect , although the dub felt a little too stilted in places for my liking at times . Even in terms of extras we can find little to complain about in this UK release - the omitted scenes included on the disk are very rough early cuts but interesting nonetheless ( one cut scene in particular paints an interesting picture of Rei and Ritsuko that is missing from the final film ) , the US dub team 's commentary is an exhaustive affair , and the \" making of \" feature gives some wonderful insight into the animation 's creative process . Throw in a shed - load of trailers and the hardcore Evangelion fans have more than enough to coo over . As an anime fan that was finally dragged outright into the wonders of Japanese animation and what it can do as a story - telling medium by Neon Genesis Evangelion , I am admittedly biased in my thoughts towards the franchise - something which can be a blessing or a curse when a series you love gets \" rebooted \" . I have to confess that my first viewing of Evangelion 2.0 left me with a slightly unsteady opinion of the film - it leaves the viewer ( and particularly those who have seen the TV anime ) with so much to take in and digest it 's difficult to know where to start . It 's this initial response and how my feelings towards the film have changed over time to the point where I ca n't help but regard it reverentially as a borderline work of genius that leads me to say that Evangelion 2.22 is not a film to watch once and then allow to gather dust on a shelf . Come back to it a few months later , watch it again and chew over what you 've just seen a little more - I almost guarantee you 'll find new things to like or ponder , and discover new aspects to this visually and emotionally busy movie that you perhaps missed the first time around . Thankfully , this top-notch presentation of You Can ( Not ) Advance for a UK audience makes watching the movie over and over again nothing short of an outright pleasure . Go out and buy it ( on Blu - Ray if you can , this is one film that absolutely deserves a High Definition treatment ) , watch it over and over , prepare yourself for the third movie with it 's as - yet unannounced release date - oh , and whatever you do , do n't hit the \" stop \" button until after the films end credits have finished rolling ... <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Experiencer\": [\"I\"], \"Situation\": [\"all of its characters grow noticeably\"], \"Other\": [\"Asuka\"], \"Time\": [\"for the past hour\"]}"}

It is provided only for personal research purposes and may not be reprinted . Brigham Young University student Madi Barney said she has filed a federal complaint against the school for denying her access to services after she reported her rape to Provo police . And a group is planning to protest BYU on Wednesday in support of Barney 's petition asking the private school to give victims of sex crimes immunity from Honor Code investigations . After she was sexually assaulted last year , Barney 's course load of 17 credits became overwhelming , she said , and professors would not accommodate her court appearances and other aspects of the investigation of her case . She asked to retroactively withdraw from two classes she struggled with , she said , but the school has not allowed her to do that . \" They 're telling me that they ca n't prove that a rape occurred , \" Barney said . So on Monday , she filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education , saying BYU denied her services available to victims under Title IX , a federal law barring sex discrimination at schools that receive funds from the U.S. government . If a school is found to have violated Title IX , it usually reaches a settlement with the Office for Civil Rights and must show it is making new efforts to comply with the federal law . Barney is one of several students at the school , owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints , who have said they were investigated by the school 's Honor Code Office after reporting a sexual assault . The Tribune ordinarily does n't name people who say they are victims of sexual violence . But Barney has agreed to be named . Barney 's alleged attacker was not a student at BYU , but the school launched an Honor Code investigation into Barney herself after it acquired a copy of the police record . \" We have received information that you have been a victim of behavior that is addressed in the university Sexual Misconduct Policy . We have also received information that you have engaged in behavior that violates the BYU Honor Code , \" a BYU Title IX coordinator wrote to Barney in December . \" I would like to meet with you and provide you with the information that we have received and give you an opportunity to respond . \" Acting on the advice of the attorney prosecuting her case , Barney declined to take part in BYU 's Honor Code investigation , and the school responded by blocking her from registering for classes , she said . Last week , Barney started an online petition asking BYU to give immunity from Honor Code Office investigations to students who report that they are the victims of sexual crimes . More than 80,000 people have signed . As of Tuesday afternoon , the federal education office had not begun any review of BYU , a spokesman said . The office could also not confirm that it had received Barney 's complaint because it acknowledges complaints only after it launches an investigation . The school on Monday said it was reviewing the relationship between its Title IX department and its Honor Code office , which enforces school standards that include bans on premaritial sex , as well as drinking and drugs . Twitter : @anniebknox The Honor Code and sexual assault at BYU April 12 \u2022 BYU students who are victims of sex crimes say they are investigated by the school and sometimes disciplined after reporting their abuse , and that in such cases the school 's Title IX office reflexively alerts the Honor Code Office . April 15 \u2022 Deputy Utah County Attorney Craig Johnson says BYU jeopardizes a pending rape prosecution because the Honor Code Office after obtaining the police file from a Utah County sheriff 's deputy who knew the suspect refuses to delay its own case against the alleged victim . April 15 \u2022 Utah County Attorney Jeffrey Buhman counters his prosecutor 's opinion that BYU 's Honor Code Office was threatening a pending rape prosecution with its probe into the victim 's actions . Buhman said he dropped a witness retaliation charge against a Utah County sheriff 's deputy because of information he learned from an inadmissible internal affairs investigation . April 18 \u2022 BYU said its Title IX investigators , charged with protecting students from sex discrimination , sometimes refer sexual assault victims to the Honor Code Office for investigation of their conduct , and announces that it will review \" potential structural changes \" in light of public concern . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [\"2016\"], \"Place\": [\"Brigham Young University\"], \"Authority\": [\"the private school\"], \"Offender\": [\"victims of sex crimes\"], \"Offense\": [\"premaritial sex , as well as drinking and drugs\"]}"}

Schools on the list were required to be closed , converted to charter schools , or subjected to a complete staff overhaul , including the principal . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> This is a carousel . Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate Across California , 188 schools got the news Monday that they were the lowest of the low- performing schools - a designation that will require them to be closed , converted to a charter school or be subject to a complete overhaul of instruction and staff , starting with the principal . Dozens of Bay Area schools , including 12 in San Francisco , landed on the state 's 5 percent lowest - achieving schools list - a ranking required by the federal government . The schools on the list serve predominantly low-income students and , therefore , receive or are eligible for Title I funds . The formula used to rank them was primarily based on standardized test scores . Each school on the list will be eligible for up to $ 2 million in federal funding annually for the next three years to help the schools improve - but only if they initiate one of four major reform strategies starting in the 2010 - 11 school year . The grant money is separate from Title I funding . Reform choice The reform choices are : -- A turnaround model : Replace the principal and retain no more than half the existing staff , giving the new principal flexibility to hire and to set the school calendar and the budget . -- A restart model : Convert to a charter school . -- School closure model : Shut down and send the students to a higher - achieving school . -- A transformation model : Replace the principal , reform instruction , increase learning time and provide operational flexibility . State law allows schools to hold off on choosing a reform strategy , but they must choose one by this fall or they will be ineligible for the Title I School Improvement Grant money - part of the Obama administration 's stimulus funding . California law requires that at some point each school on Monday 's list will have to pick a plan , with or without the extra money . \" I would not have a school think they can just ignore this and not have to implement , \" said Theresa Garcia , executive director of the state Board of Education . \" If you really want to have money to do it , you need to apply for the ( federal ) grant . \" The state is eligible for up to $ 416 million of the $ 3.5 billion pot of money . The funding could pay for staff , supplies , longer school days , training , textbooks or whatever else local officials think could help turn test scores around . Parents , students and community members need to be a big part of that conversation , said Alberto Retana , director of community outreach for the federal Department of Education . \" The folks who have the most to gain and the most to lose are the critical part ( of ) this effort being successful , \" he said . \" We need a strong and aggressive community to be behind these efforts . \" Districts and schools opting to participate in the federal grant funding will have to have a plan within the next few months - giving them little time to prepare . A school on the list At San Francisco 's Horace Mann Middle School , first - year Principal Mark Sanchez said he got the call early Monday that his school was on the list . He said the four options looked \" somewhat draconian . \" The federal regulations allow the schools to keep principals who have been on the job two years or less , so Sanchez would n't necessarily have to go . Nonetheless , being labeled one of the worst schools in the state could make it hard next year to lure families into a school that Sanchez said he believes has already made great strides in improving the behavior and academic performance of its students . The label could undermine those efforts , he said . Sanchez said he planned to tell his teachers Monday afternoon , then wait and see what happens in terms of the district 's application for school improvement grant funding . If Horace Mann decides to apply , the community would have to put a lot of thought into which model to choose and how to spend the money , he said . Effective strategies Federal education officials said each of the four intervention strategies has been effective in turning around schools , although state officials said they had n't reviewed the evidence . The federal Department of Education Web site listed four schools , in Chicago , Los Angeles , Philadelphia and Hamilton County , Tenn. , as examples of success . \" We 've thrown money at a problem before and it did n't solve it , \" Retana said . \" We have to point toward those models that have worked . \" \" Our parents in these schools want change , \" said Pecolia Manigo , education equity campaign lead for Coleman Advocates , a San Francisco organization focused on children and family needs . \" This is a conversation that has needed to exist for a longer amount of time . \" Turning schools around Schools on the lowest - performing list released Monday each will be eligible for up to $ 2 million in federal Title I money annually for three years if they initiate one of the following reform strategies starting in 2010 - 11 : Turnaround model : Replace the principal and at least half of the existing staff . The new principal would have flexibility to hire and to set the school calendar and budget . Restart model : Convert to a charter school . School - closure model : Shut down and send the students to higher - achieving schools . A transformation model : Replace the principal , reform instruction , increase learning time and provide operational flexibility . Low-performing schools The following is a list of Bay Area schools , divided by district , that were classified Monday as persistently low-achieving - a group that falls in the bottom 5 percent statewide : Hayward Unified - Burbank Elementary ; Longwood Elementary ; Hayward High School ; Mount Eden High School ; Tennyson High School Oakland Unified - Alliance Academy ; Elmhurst Community Prep ; Explore Middle School ; Roots International Academy ; United for Success Academy San Lorenzo Unified - Hillside Elementary West Contra Costa Unified - Lincoln Elementary ; De Anza Senior High School ; Pinole Valley High School San Francisco Unified - Willie L.

Jodi Dean writes on his blog I Cite that we experience two people but one voice : \" we hear the one who is speaking and know that it is him , but we also hear another - only rarely do we mistake one for the other , we know the difference \" . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Johan Grimonprez art Hitchcock didn\u00e2t have a belly button | 2009 A voice as something more Jodi Dean October 29 , 2009 While I was in Belgium last week , I went to an exhibit at the Strombeek gallery in Brussels that highlighted work by Johan Grimonprez ( director of Double Take ) . One of the pieces was a sound piece , an interview with Karen Black . One does n't listen to the interview with headphones but in a small , round room with a platform in the middle . The room is dimly lit , with a paraphrase of a line from the interview ( about Alfred Hitchcock not having a belly button ) written in white on one of the dark blue walls . One can sit or lie down on the platform\u00e2 I bet 4 - 5 people could lie on it without crowding each other . Most of the interview involves Karen Black 's recollecting working with Hitchcock on Family Plot . The piece feels intimate , maybe too intimate ( I wonder if it feels the same to people who have never seen Karen Black ) . It feels more intimate than it would if one were reading it or even than it would if one saw the interview on television . The dark space , the enveloping sound , the vulnerability of lying down in a public space all amplify the intimacy , the intrusion . One gets absorbed in or enveloped by her voice , caught up in it , at risk of giving over to it . Her voice feels more intimate than it would if one were listening to it with headphones or earbuds or on a laptop in an office\u00e2with all those versions of personal media we are less exposed in our hearing , less vulnerable to others ' seeing us and maybe hearing us hearing ( hearing us hearing could be linked to a version of a primal scene or to hearing ourselves being heard ) . She does impressions\u00e2of Hitchcock , of different accents . These seem risky , outrageous\u00e2why is she performing so much , why is she so over the top\u00e2but even quick attempts to dismiss them\u00e2well , she is an actress , after all\u00e2ca n't bracket the excess and intensity of her enveloping voice . It 's her voice , in all those impression ; her voice , pretending to be Hitchcock . And how is it , then , that with vocal doubles we experience two people but one voice ? The pleasure is the imitation , the impersonation , the slight exaggeration and bringing to our attention the eccentricity or uniqueness of what now echoes as an original . But the uniqueness only resounds as ' re ' , as a repetition , as the approach to the original that is n't . With the vocal double , we hear the one who is speaking and know that it is him , but we also hear another\u00e2only rarely do we mistake one for the other , we know the difference ( and that knowledge is a component of the very possibility of impersonation , of a vocal double\u00e2we could compare the vocal double , then , with the voice - over or the voice of an animated character ) . I do n't like hearing my voice . I do n't listen to interviews or podcasts that I 've done . I loathe listening to answering machines or voice mail when I have to hear my voice ( although I should confess that this sometimes reverses itself as I listen over and over again to my greeting , somewhat repulsed , but still unable to stop listening and re-recording , perhaps in an attempt to eliminate the excessive part , the part that I ca n't quite control\u00e2and , no , it 's not just the southern accent , although it could be related to the oddness I hear in the attempts to displace it ) . Even doubled or impersonated , the voice is Real . Even recorded voices , taped voices , are Real\u00e2we can tell the difference . On the phone , we can hear if something is wrong -- sometimes it 's easier to hear that something is wrong than to see it\u00e2appearances can be deceiving . I do n't like talking on the phone very much , either , wary of the exposure that is more intense than a face to face encounter , likely because face to face we see the reactions of the other . Surrounded by music and noise , do we lose voice ( s ) ? Or are we protecting ourselves from their intensity ? Are we , vulnerable bare lives , barely subjects , whatever beings , at the mercy of the imaginary and the Real and denuded of Symbolic protections , do we need the noise to avoid the voice ( and might schizoanalysis fail insofar as it risks trivializing the intrusion of voices without bodies ) ? And how has contemporary pseudo-politics worked to block from us the radicality of the Real voice , inducing us to refer to any misrepresentation or exclusion as a loss of voice or a denial of voice when really adding to the cacophony is the surest way for the voice not to be heard ?

Sandboarding can also be <event> practised <\/event> sitting down or lying on the belly or the back . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Last Updated on April 28 , 2022 Sandboarding ( a.k.a. sand surfing or dune boarding ) is an extreme sport similar to snowboarding which is practiced on sand dunes rather than snow . A special board , called a sandboard , is used to ski on sandy terrains , although sand slates are also sometimes used . While still niche activities and hardly recognized as \u201c official \u201d sports , both sand boarding and sand sledding have gained much popularity over the past couple of decades and have now become a tourist attraction for desert locations worldwide , with sandboarding spots also being artificially created on beach destinations and inside of cities away from deserted areas . Popular sandboarding destinations are Peru , Australia and South Africa , while specialized facilities or \u201c sandboarding parks \u201d have been built in Florence , Oregon and Hirschau , Germany . There are also a handful of sandboarding sport events and competitions held every year . As part of the Amazon Associate and eBay Partner Programme , we earn from qualifying purchases . How to sandboard Sandboarding does not require much in terms of training nor equipment , but the location and type of dune will make a great difference on your experience and ability to join the ride . Sandboarding at the beach is generally less demanding than sandboarding in the desert , and what you really need is just a good board and plenty of wax . Desert dunes are generally higher and steeper and offer the best rides , not to mention the most spectacular landscapes , but you will also need special equipment and appropriate clothing as to make sure everything goes smoothly . Sandboards are similar to snowboards but have a thicker laminate base which is made specifically to slide on dunes and resist abrasion from sand . Sandboarding equipment : Also recommended : - Sandboarding Insurance - Closed - toe shoes - Goggles - Elbow and Knee Pads - Helmet - Mouth Scarf - Sunscreen - Lots of water Getting started Once you get your sandboarding gear and clothing ready , it 's time to head to the dunes . Walk up hill until you find a good sliding spot \u2013 a steep dune with dry , thin sand and no obstructions is ideal \u2013 then place your board on the ground , back up , so you can wax it thoroughly . Make sure to test that the surface of your board is slippery by applying sand to it until it 's no longer sticky . You are now ready to slide down \u2013 either standing up \u201c surfing the sand \u201d ( make sure your sand board has foot bindings ! ) or either sitting or lying down on your belly ( also known as sand sledding , which is best performed with a smaller sand sled or toboggan ) . The former position will give you more adrenaline and allow you to do tricks , somewhat akin to snowboarding , but will also increase your chances to fall down . Depending on the type of terrain and weather , you may need to wear protective gear to avoid injuries . That said , falling on sand is part of the game and so are the following weeks that you will spend scooping out sands from your clothes and belongings ! Sliding down When you are ready to slide , position your board on the edge of the dune and your legs on it so that your dominant foot is in front of the board , and tightly strap both of your feet into the bindings . You should be able to push the board forward by slightly bending your knees and using your body weight to advance . If you are sledding on your belly , you can use your arms to push yourself off the dune , making sure to keep your chin and legs up to maintain balance . Whatever position you are in , your goal is to try and keep your weight centered as you slide . If you have experience sliding on snow , you 'll find yourself having less control on your movements when doing this on sand , and you will not be able to significantly change the direction you are going to once you are sliding . But sand surfing can be an incredibly fun and thrilling experience , and once you are downhill , the first thing you 'll want to do is climb back up and do it again ! Take the adequate precautions Sandboarding is an extreme action sport and as such , it can be dangerous and in some cases even deadly . All beginner sandboarders are advised to take some minimum safety precautions , bearing in mind that even though the sand looks soft , falling at high speed can be much more painful than it seems . Wearing protection gear such as a helmet , elbow pads and knee pads while riding very tall dunes is a must , and it is also recommended to always wear comfortable and adequate clothing as a form of protection from scorching . Barefoot \/ barechest sandboarding should only be practiced on small , coastal dunes in beach areas and not in the desert . You are planning to go sandboarding , you better make sure that your health insurance covers sandboarding \u2013 most do not . Sandboarding vs Snowboarding Is sandboarding similar to snowboarding ? While both sports share the same concept of gliding down a hill while riding a piece of wood , sandboarding differs from snowboarding in many ways . Compared to snow , sand has very high friction , which makes sliding on sand much slower than sliding on snowy surfaces , and also making it much harder to turn . Because of this , sandboarding can also be practiced while sitting or laying down on the board . That sad , going down very steep dunes allows one to build up velocity in a way similar with snowboarding , and falling down can be painful \u2013 especially on warm days with scorching hot sands . The majority of sandboarding locations are also not equipped with anything similar to ski lifts , which means sandboarders have to walk back up a dune after gliding to the bottom . Is sandboarding difficult ? Sand surfing per se is not difficult , but people who are used to snowboarding will likely find themselves having less control of their movements while sliding on sand . How easy it is to maneauver a sandboard depends on the type , shape and size of the board as well as the type of terrain , wetness of the sand and steepness of the dune . For beginners , it may be easier to start with sand sledding \u2013 either lying down on your belly or sitting on a toboggan or sand dune sled rather than standing on your feet . Can you use a snowboard on sand ? Short answer : yes , but you should n't . Using a snowboard on a sand dune will result in the inevitable \u2026 well , sanding of the board . While it is techinically possible to wax an old snowboard and use it to skii in the desert , it is recommended to buy a sandboard specifically for sand dunes . Nowadays there are plenty of companies worldwide making boards with technologies specifically suited for sandy terrains , which will allow for smoother , faster sliding and have higher maneuverability compared to snowboards or other board sports that do n't belong on sand . Read more : 5 Reasons Why Sandboarding is Different from Snowboarding What are sand boards made of ? Compared to that of snowboards , the surface of a sandboard is harder as it usually consists of a hardwood ply or composite fiberglass and wood with a Formica or Laminex plastic layer at the base . Most boards also come equipped with foot bindings , straps , or bungees . In order to glide better in the sand , the underside of the board needs to be regularly waxed , usually with a paraffin-based wax . While sandboards vary in shape and size , they are often much shorter than snowboards , which allows to further reduce surface friction with the sand , making it easier to glide down rough surfaces . This makes going down a sand dune with a sandboard much more enjoyable than doing the same with a snowboard , surfboard or slate . There are quite a few companies producing high quality , commercial sandboards worldwide nowadays , but you can also make your own DIY board if you prefer . Sandboards vs sandsleds Sandsleds ( also called sand toboggans or bumsleds ) are essentially smaller sandboards meant for sitting or laying down on your belly , and are especially suited for kids . Larger dune sleds can accomodate up to two people sitting . Compared to standing - up sandboarding , sand dune sledding is easier as it requires no balancing nor maneuverability skill , making it a fun and safe activity that is both family - friendly and ideal for beginners . Sandboards for Sale Browse more sandboards and sandsleds When was sandboarding invented ? The origins of sandboarding as a sport are not clear , with some claiming that similar activities could be dating back a good 2000 years . Was sliding down sand dunes a thing in Ancient Egypt ? Possibly ! More recently , reports of modern sandboarding date this sport back to the mid 20th century , with surfers in Brazil taking their boards on sand whenever there was not strong enough wind or sea waves to surf on . Across the United States , people were also \u201c surfing \u201d on sand dunes in the 60s , way before specific sand board equipment was invented . The first major developments in sandboarding came around the same time that snowboarding was taking off in the 1970s , but only began to capture the center stage as one of the most exciting outdoor adventure sports within the past ten years . State of sandboarding as of Since its growth in popularity , sand parks have popped up all across the globe and dune riders have gathered together to showcase their talents at tournaments and events in idyllic settings like Dubai , Australia , Namibia , Japan , Chile and the Western United States . It was only around the late 90s and early 2000s that people started recognizing sandboarding as an official sport activity , with sandboard manufacturers starting to develop technological equipment tailored to meet the needs of sandboarders and addressing common issues of using snow equipment on sand . Today , the sport has gained enough attention to attract people worldwide with several sandboarding facilities and events in almost every continent . Modern sandboarding was especially made popular by the efforts of Lone Beale ( a.k.a. \u201c Doctor Dune \u201d ) , owner of the Sand Master Park in Florence , Oregon \u2013 the first recreation facility in the world entirely dedicated to sandboarding and dune sledding ; and by those of Peruvian farmer Mat\u00edas Grados Mora who held the first sandboarding championships in Huacachina . The sandboarding world championship was then held for many years on Monte Kaolino in Hirschau , Germany , the only sandsports facility equipped with a lift . Due to restructural changes and limited capacity , since 2007 the World Championship has been replaced by the Sandboard World Cup , which is organized by Swiss organization InterSands in South America .

The sport is especially popular in South America , parts of Africa and the Middle East , where the highest dunes and desert locations are found : the UAE , Saudi Arabia , and Qatar are some of the most popular destinations , but Israel also has a booming sandboarding industry . All across Australia there are also popular sandboarding spots , mostly on beach dunes , as for New Zealand , the UK and Ireland . In Asia , sandboarding is popular in the Philippines and Indonesia , and also parts of Japan and China .

The Federation is not seeking funding or other assistance from donors for this operation at this time . Activities undertaken are aligned with the International Federation 's Global Agenda , which sets out four broad goals to meet the Federation 's mission to \" improve the lives of vulnerable people by mobilizing the power of humanity \" . Global Agenda Goals : Reduce the numbers of deaths , injuries and impact from disasters . Reduce the number of deaths , illnesses and impact from diseases and public health emergencies . Increase local community , civil society and Red Cross \/ Red Crescent capacity to address the most urgent situations of vulnerability . Reduce intolerance , discrimination and social exclusion and promote respect for diversity and human dignity . The Situation Cyclone Indlala hit the north- eastern coast of the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar on Thursday , 15 March 2007 . With strong winds up to 165 km \/h , the cyclone is still ravaging the country and is expected to last until Sunday , 18 March . It is moving on a path towards the south west of Madagascar and has left considerable damage on the north east coastline . Roofs have been blown away and around 40 % of property in the town of Antalaha has been destroyed . About 90 % of the buildings at the town 's police station and CARE International offices have been damaged . Infrastructure such as water and electricity has also been affected . Displaced and affected people from Maroantsetra have gathered at the town 's municipal council hall . In Mananara North , rising water level in the river is threatening to cut off the area . Communication has been affected , denying small communities access to weather reports since the national radio has been off -air , in some areas , for the last two days . Authorities have considered closing schools in the area . Cyclone Indlala is the fifth cyclone that has hit \/ affected the country within the past three months : Cyclone Bondo made landfall on 25 December 2006 ; Cyclone Clovis on 3 January 2007 ; Cyclone Favio on 18 January 2007 ; and Cyclone Gamede on 26 February 2007 . This is the first time that the island has been struck by so many cyclones in such a short period . Seasonal rains have been made worse by the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) moving slightly south , resulting in continuous rains from the end of December 2006 to the present moment . The accumulated impact of all these cyclones is damage to infrastructure and crops , flooding , landslides and displacement of communities . The Government of Malagasy estimates that 293,000 people have been affected by the floods , with 32,000 displaced . More than 150,000 farming families have lost a total of 90,000 hectares of crop . Immediate needs include targeted food distribution to prevent malnutrition , essential drugs , water and sanitation . On 20 February 2007 , the Malagasy Government launched a US $ 242 million appeal . On 15 March 2007 , the United Nations and its humanitarian partners launched a Flash Appeal requesting nearly USD 9.6 million to provide aid to people affected by floods and cyclones for a period up to six months . Red Cross Action The Malagasy Red Cross Society ( MRCS ) has indicated that there are humanitarian needs arising from the recent storms and has proposed pre-positioning of stocks which could be released upon demand . The National Society has also highlighted the need to address the damage to livelihoods and the possibility of future storms during the current season . In order to have a more conclusive assessment of the humanitarian situation arising from the storms and to determine the capacity of the National Society to address existing and future gaps , a decision has been taken to place a disaster management ( DM ) specialist selected from the Regional Disaster Response Team ( RDRT ) with the MRCS for a period of 6 weeks . The DM specialist , who arrived on Wednesday 14 March , is expected to work closely with the MRCS and the International Federation staff in Madagascar . No full assessment of the impact of Cyclone Indlala can begin before Monday , 19 March , given the prevailing weather and road conditions . The Federation Indian Ocean Islands sub-regional office is in close contact with the French Red Cross - through the Indian Ocean Regional Disaster Response Platform ( PIROI ) ( 1 ) - who would be the first to intervene , should the Malagasy Red Cross Society request for assistance in carrying out an assessment . In the event that back up assessment resources would be required , an RDRT alert has been issued .

From there , Tony Rosato took his zany writing and performing style to the small screen , winning fame on SCTV and later on Saturday Night Live . His off - the - wall characters ranged from fictional TV chef Marcello Sebastiano to Lou Costello , Captain Kangaroo and Yasser Arafat . Industry buzz pegged him as the next John Belushi . Rosato went on to perform in a variety of TV shows and movies . In 1989 he was nominated for the best-supporting - actor Gemini for his role as police informant Whitey in Night Heat . Then suddenly , two years ago , Rosato disappeared . Since then , the actor has been behind bars , with no trial , at the maximum - security Quinte Detention Centre in Napanee , 30 kilometres west of Kingston , on charges of criminally harassing his wife during their marriage . It 's alleged that his \" reckless \" behaviour led his spouse , Leah , with whom he has a now - 2 - year - old daughter , to be afraid for her own safety or others ' . According to his Toronto lawyer , Daniel Brodsky , Rosato was arrested after repeatedly complaining to police that , in a scenario reminiscent of the film Invasion of the Body Snatchers , the actor 's wife and their infant daughter had gone missing , having been replaced by imposters . The Italian -born , Toronto - based actor , now 53 , has had a bail hearing and a preliminary inquiry . Both of them are subject to publication bans . Arraignment documents show Rosato was denied bail almost three months after his arrest , after undergoing a mental fitness assessment . He has never had a bail review , and his trial ( by judge alone ) is n't scheduled until Nov. 13 . Rosato steadfastly maintains that he is sane , and innocent . \" I 'm not pleading guilty \u2013 I 'm fighting injustice \" has been his mantra in phone calls with show business friends . \" The situation is unbelievable , \" says Brodsky , who notes his client does n't have a criminal record and has never threatened to hurt anyone . \" It 's shocking . \" Rosato 's situation raises troubling questions . Why must he wait so long for a trial ? And if he is suffering from mental illness , why is n't he in a hospital room instead of a jail cell ? \" On the date of his trial Tony Rosato will have spent more time in custody on a harassment charge than any other convicted prisoner in Canada has ever spent on the same charges , \" says Brodsky , who took on Rosato 's case in March . \" On average , someone convicted of criminal harassment spends one day in jail and two years on probation . \" On the first day of Rosato 's trial , Brodsky \u2013 a founding member of the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted \u2013 plans to apply to have the case dismissed because of unreasonable delay and abuse of process in failing to get Rosato into a hospital . Brodsky explains that the Crown 's expert prison psychiatrist , Dr. Duncan Scott , has told him and the Crown \" that Tony Rosato is certifiable . \" Scott 's diagnosis , says Brodsky , is a mental illness called Capgras syndrome . Named for its discoverer , French psychiatrist Jean Marie Joseph Capgras , the syndrome is characterized by the delusion that a person or people have been replaced by doubles or impostors . The rare condition is most commonly associated with schizophrenia , but according to Dr. Graham Glancy , a forensic psychiatrist with Metro West Detention Centre and Maplehurst Correctional Complex , it can also be caused by metabolic diseases , delirium , brain injury or drugs such as cocaine . Kingston assistant Crown attorney Priscilla Christie has declined to talk about Rosato and referred questions to the Ministry of the Attorney General . It 's a \" complex \" case , says ministry spokesperson Brendan Crawley . Rosato , he continues , is viewed by the Crown as \" an allegedly dangerous person with mental health issues who has been charged with a crime . \" But if the Crown sees Rosato as mentally ill , then why has he been languishing in jail for two years instead of being moved to a hospital ? \" People who the Crown believes have mental disorders deserve much better , \" says Brodsky , a director of the Mental Health Legal Committee who has fought the criminalization of the mentally ill . But Crawley says \" the Criminal Code provides for a limited number of circumstances in which the court can order an accused person transferred from custody to a psychiatric facility . \" And , he continues , the Crown has taken \" every available step to ensure the fair treatment and placement of the accused , including taking steps to facilitate the transfer of the accused to a psychiatric hospital if possible . \" However , lawyer Anita Szigeti , former chair of the Mental Health Legal Committee , contends that the Crown could instead have hospitalized him under civil legislation . \" Criminal lawyers and Crowns in the traditional system are often unaware of the varied mechanisms under the Mental Health Act that can be employed for the hospitalization of individuals with mental health problems ... including people in jail , \" says Szigeti , co-author of A Guide to Consent and Capacity Law in Ontario , a book focusing on mental health and the law . Meanwhile , Crawley says the trial has been delayed \" to accommodate Rosato 's change of counsel . \" In fact , Rosato did go through six lawyers \u2013 he fired some and others quit \u2013 before hiring Brodsky . Crawley also observes that none of Rosato 's lawyers has requested a bail review , so that their client might wait for trial as a free man . Once he receives all the required documentation , Brodsky intends to apply for a bail review for Rosato . If his client is released on bail , says Brodsky , \" he will walk out the front door of the jail into the waiting arms of hospital psychiatric staff , where he 'll be detained until trial . \" Also puzzling to some in the legal profession is why Rosato 's case is being heard not in provincial court , where virtually all harassment cases are heard , but in Superior Court , where only the most serious cases go . \" It takes six to eight months longer , not including the trial , \" says Brodsky , \" and it costs at least three times more . \" \" I do n't think I 've ever known a criminal harassment case to be tried in Superior Court , \" says Felicity Hawthorn , an assistant Crown attorney in Lindsay , Ont. , and one of Rosato 's former lawyers who represented him at his preliminary inquiry last year and has since moved to the Crown 's office . \" It 's very odd ... \" Rosato 's friends in show business are appalled at the actor 's situation . \" It 's a travesty , \" says Andrew Alexander , the Chicago - based owner and CEO of Second City and producer of SCTV , who hired Rosato for stage and TV back in the late 1970s . \" It 's quite extraordinary that in the system he is just falling through the cracks ... Where he is now legally is obviously terrible . \" Even Rosato 's estranged wife , who says she was and is afraid of him , told the Star she 's \" shocked that it ( Rosato 's case ) has taken this long ... I want him to get mental help ... in a psychiatric hospital . \" Rosato 's legal woes began after his wife left him on Jan. 17 , 2005 , fleeing their Broadview Ave. apartment with their daughter , who was born the previous September , and eventually returning to her hometown of Kingston . \" She left him a note , \" says Tony 's devoted mother , 77- year - old Maria Rosato . \" Tony phoned me crying and sobbing . He thought maybe she 'd been kidnapped . \" But Leah Rosato told the Star that she had fled their home out of fear . \" I thought he was dangerous \u2013 that 's why I left him , \" she says softly . A couple of weeks after she left , on Feb. 3 , 2005 , Leah was granted an emergency motion for sole custody of their baby . An only child , Tony had immigrated to Canada from Naples with his parents when he was 4 ( his father subsequently returned to Italy for medical reasons ) . First , the family lived in Halifax , then Ottawa , and finally in Toronto , where he completed Grade 13 at Oakwood Collegiate and later studied sciences at the Scarborough campus of University of Toronto . ( As a young man he also worked part-time at the Star as a classified ad taker . ) At one point , recalls his mother , her son aspired to become a chiropractor . But he dropped out of university before graduating , having caught the acting bug after a night out at Second City . He 'd later perform onstage there , and on television with SCTV and Saturday Night Live . After Rosato 's SNL stint ( 1981 - 82 ) , he divided his time between Toronto and Los Angeles , until settling here four years ago . He met his wife to be , Leah Murray , who is 22 years his junior , in a Danforth Ave. coffee shop when she was visiting from Kingston . Leah , now 31 , told the Star in an interview that she fell \" deeply in love with him . \" After a whirlwind , three - month courtship straddling Toronto and the eastern Ontario city , they got married at Toronto City Hall on New Year 's Eve , 2003 . Friends say they found their witnesses outside , at the public skating rink . According to the actor 's widowed mother , Leah wanted to get into acting , and her son was on board to try and make that happen in L.A. After the marriage , the couple kept their separate residences in Toronto and Kingston . According to friend Adrian Truss , an actor ( the troupe Illustrated Men ) and writer , Tony was short of cash and was living with his mother . The couple spent weekends together . Leah was studying Catholicism at her husband 's request . Just before their baby 's birth , in September 2004 , Leah moved into a Broadview Ave. apartment with Tony . The actor 's friends say he behaved strangely once he and Leah were living together . Tony would n't allow anyone to come to their apartment . He made Leah give out a post-office - box address . Family and friends were told not to call ; he would call them . Tony told friends he was connected to higher energies and had \" information to save the planet , \" says his long - time friend Derek McGrath , who plays Rev. Magee in Little Mosque on the Prairie . Rosato believes he is \" the guardian of light , \" adds McGrath , who worked with Rosato at Second City and has supported the beleaguered actor through his legal travails , attending most of his court appearances with Tony 's cousin Lena DeCaria , a Mississauga banker . A letter Rosato wrote from jail on June 5 , 2005 , a month after his arrest , gives his version of what happened after the departure of Leah and the baby . It documents what he perceived as evidence that he was the victim of a \" fraudulent hoax \" \u2013 that his wife and daughter had been replaced by doubles . The CD wedding photos Leah left behind , Rosato wrote , proved the woman in the pictures was not his real wife but a \" twin . \" His real wife had obviously been replaced by a duplicate who was \" dressed identically \" to his wife . Rosato wrote that he went to Toronto and then Kingston police to tell them that his wife had been <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Experiencer\": [\"Tony Rosato\"], \"Time\": [\"suddenly , two years ago\"], \"Place\": [\"at the police station\"], \"Situation\": [\"trouble\"]}"}

An English version of the song would later <event> appear <\/event> on country singer Jill Johnson 's 1996 album Sugartree . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Here it is \u2013 the traditional Daily Roxette team album review ! Lars - Erik , Thomas , Judith , Colin & Paul gathered in the virtual TDR newsroom to write up this special review on Roxette 's brand - new album ! It 's been a long , long time ( It 's been a while and lots of miles \u2026 ) coming but here we are \u2026 a brand new studio album from Roxette . Years of speculation on Roxette 's future have ended with the release of Charm School and the upcoming World Tour . As for the album itself , it has so many trademark Roxette sounds , yet is totally new and it feels great to have real instruments again on some of the songs . Most fans we 're sure will love it , but obviously there will always be some who wo n't . Our review is quite lengthy , but it 's been 10 years since we 've had a chance to do one of these . Anyway , song by song review time : \u201c WAY OUT \u201d Colin : A Roxette album that starts with a mouth harp \u2013 that must be a first ! The first verse really has that Aerosol Grey Machine studio sound and then at the catchy chorus the heavier guitars kick in . The song has a really positive vibe to it and to me it feels like a sequel to \u201c June Afternoon \u201d \u2013 awesome ! Thomas : \u201c We will we will rock you ! \u201d drums . Love those guitars . And it must be Per playing that first weee - wah - wah - wah - wa after the first chorus ! They also used a mouth harp in \u201c I Remember You \u201d if you remember . Colin : Oh I do remember ! That was my first Roxette song \u2013 loved it ! Paul : This song reminds me more of \u201c Stupid \u201d from The World According To Gessle . The drum beat is very similar indeed . Lars - Erik : You know you 're right ! I thought this had a familiar sound to it and that was it ! Paul : Not a typical Rox-album -opener really . I was expecting something along the lines of \u201c Crush On You \u201d or \u201c Real Sugar \u201d , so this came as a surprise \u2026 a nice surprise . The song , as with a few others on the album , is too short though . A Marie middle -8 would have fixed that problem Mr G! Thomas : 2.46 ?? That 's barely longer than \u201c H\u00e4r kommer alla k\u00e4nslorna \u201d . Judith : Now that you mention this song , I keep having this one in mind when I listen to some of the tracks on this album . It must be the happy mood . This album has a lot of the Roxette sound we know , but yet we get to hear some new sounds we never heard with Roxette before . This is one example . Great guitars and opener ! I am glad that Per realized he can use and experiment with his voice a lot more than he used to ! I must say both sing wonderfully on this album . I think this is a wonderful album so you wo n't get much negative points from my side , I am afraid . The only one is that the album is too short ! I want more !! 2 - 3 more songs would have done it . Thomas : Yes , what else is there to add ? This is one of my favorites as well , maybe even \u201c The Favorite \u201d and I had hoped the whole album had been a bit more like this song . Colin : Definitely one of my favorites too , after listening to the albums a few times this is the chorus that really keeps hanging around in my head ! Lars - Erik : Nobody 's mentioned the ending \u2026 I really like it ! I think the distorted guitar there is cool ! Thomas : Yes we did ! We all felt it came way too soon ! \u201c NO ONE MAKES IT ON HER OWN \u201d Paul : Roxette is the only band who can do these types of songs , and do them well . Thomas : Yes , it 's like Per says , only he can do a Per Gessle -song ( like it should sound ) . Others have tried and I guess we all know how that turned out \u2026 Paul : Marie 's vocals on this are great , I love the way her voice sounds a little different to previous albums . To me , it sounds more natural and ' live ' , just like Pearls of Passion recordings . I think there are parts of the song which may refer to her illness . Judith : I agree with Paul , Marie sounds like on the live album and tour last year . Very touching song and Marie is top notch ! Actually , after having heard these two songs , you know you are in for a treat : vocals , music , production . Thomas : I have to say even though Marie sings beautifully and the lyrics are nice , this song does n't move me as much I thought it would . It 's not that I do n't like it , but already at track 2 it feels , to me , like an album filler . The piano and the bass is very Lennon & McCartney and so is the guitar solo . Colin : I agree . the song has a laid back feeling and surely it has a strong message but honestly I this is a track I 'll skip most of the time . It might grow on me though over time . Lars - Erik : Filler ?!? I do n't think too many people will agree with you on that . Thomas : I 'm sure I 'll get some flak over it , I 'm used to that . Lars - Erik : This is definitely a strong song with stand - alone qualities . I love the way the lyrics transition from \u201c her own \u201d at the beginning of the song to \u201c their own \u201d at the end \u2026 from a personal reflection to a generic , universal truth . I think the song resonates , long after the music is over . Paul : I did n't notice that transition . Well spotted ! \u201c SHE'S GOT NOTHING ON ( BUT THE RADIO ) \u201d Lars - Erik : This is n't the first time this famous Marilyn Monroe quote has been used to inspire a song , but of the ones I know about , this one certainly has the most energy . That hook certainly is infectious ! Thomas : Marilyn Monroe ? Lars - Erik : Yeah \u2026 she was asked at a press conference about upcoming photos of her that were to appear in the one of the very first issues of Playboy magazine . A reporter asked what , if anything , she was wearing at the photoshoot . \u201c It 's not true that I had nothing on . I had the radio on , \u201d was her reply ! Paul : From the moment I heard the chorus I knew that Roxette had come back with a great song . This might have worked better as the opening song of the album , seems its in an odd place at number 3 . But it 's a great song , and I ca n't wait to see them perform it live this summer ! Plus , I actually like the video \u2026 Judith : Loved this one from the beginning , different , crazy , but still , Roxettish . My favorite part is the first one with the \u201c really ? \u201d \u2013 this is so much funny teasing Roxette ! And Marie's . Colin : The first time I heard the song 's first few seconds it really reminded me of \u201c Thai With A Twist \u201d , it has that \u201c Spegelboll \u201d disco - like feeling . A good choice for a first single with a fresh Roxette sound but it sounds a bit overproduced . Thomas : The guitars could 've been more prominent . Judith : I have a major problem with all tracks on this album , they are addictive and wo n't leave your head .. found myself humming all the tunes now and then . Thomas : Yes , although so far not a hit in Sweden , and I do n't know if the charts down in Europe are \u201c real \u201d charts or fan voted . I really like this song , especially the catchy chorus . Per obviously sings this and it has a lot of machines , almost like \u201c Crush On You \u201d but more softly produced . Basically nonsense lyrics like \u201c The Look \u201d or \u201c Joyride \u201d but that 's what we want on a Roxette album , no ? There are remixes coming soon , by the way . \u201c SPEAK TO ME \u201d Colin : While the guitar riffs during the verse remind me of \u201c ( Do You Get ) Excited ? \u201d , the overall atmosphere and feeling of this beautiful duet brings back the Pearls of Passion feeling but with a much more modern , grown up sound . Thumbs up for C&C \u2013 great job of getting back some of that ' old Rox sound ' ! Thomas : Yes , this makes me also think about the Pearls of Passion era , but more modern . One of my top three with the pumping bass in the background and the keyboards all over the place . Did anyone else notice the \u201c You Ca n't Put Your Arms Around What 's Already Gone \u201d reference in the last verse \/ chorus ? Judith : Yes ! I thought ha ! Roxette doing a cameo of themselves ? Paul : No . What reference ? Thomas : \u201c Sank like a stone \u201d , same words , same intonation , same sound ! No ? Paul : * Goes and has a listen * Well , maybe . Just maybe though . Thomas : Yeah I may be over- interpreting it \u2026 Judith : Reminds me of \u201c I 'm sorry \u201d , \u201c ( Do You Get ) Excited ? \u201d . Marie 's ( backing ) vocals \u201c oohh yeah \u201d , \u201c ooh .. \u201d .. you cannot resist that ! Paul : Anyway , who 'd of thought Roxette still had this in them ? C&C&P certainly did a great production on this one . The song is amazing , and it NEEDS to be a single . Maybe the first single release in the UK perhaps ?? This could easily have been on their Crash ! Boom ! Bang ! album and I think this could ( if it was promoted blah blah blah ) have a chance of being their biggest UK single since \u201c Wish I Could Fly . \u201d Wonder what it 'll sound like live ?? Colin : I could n't agree more with you Paul , this is an epic song and needs to be on the radio ! Thomas : I do hope that countries get to choose singles somewhat more freely . Some songs work better in certain territories . Paul : The perception of Roxette in the UK is mainly ballads , and I think that this song will give them their best chance . \u201c Radio \u201d would n't be a success at all , I do n't think . Thomas : By the way , the vinyl version is slowed down . That will be interesting to hear . Lars - Erik : I stopped at this track , and listened to it over and over again \u2026 conjuring up images and directing the music video version in my head . I just love this song , and especially like the way Marie 's voice is introduced with a \u201c zoom \u201d effect . \u201c I'M GLAD YOU CALLED \u201d Lars - Erik : Rain . Thunder . It makes for an effective segue between these two songs . But really , other than Mystic Moods Orchestra , I do n't know of any group with more references to rain on their albums than Roxette . Paul : I loved the Party Crasher version . This is the song that I listen to the least at the moment . Maybe its because its not a brand new song ? It reminds me of \u201c First Girl On The Moon \u201d , and I did n't like that one at first , so maybe this is a grower ? Marie 's vocals are clearly recorded live and left untouched , something which proves how good her voice still is . Judith : I thought we would get the song as we know it from Party Crasher , so when I heard the first words sung by Marie , it simply blew me away , my reaction was \u201c OH \u201d \u2013 ( more ) tears followed . It 's like Marie is singing in your ear , so soft , so touching . St\u00e5 <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Entity\": [\"version\"], \"Location\": [\"Jill 's album\"]}"}

The Cladh Hallan mummies are four skeletons found at an archaeological site on the South Uist island in the Outer Hebrides in Scotland . \" <event> Mummification <\/event> in Bronze Age Britain \" BBC History . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> British Broadcasting Corporation Home Accessibility links History By David Keys Last updated 2011-02-17 According to sensational archaeological discoveries currently being made in Scotland , Bronze Age Britons were practising the art of mummification at the same time as ' mummy culture ' was in full swing in Pharaonic Egypt . It appears that ancient Britons invented this skill for themselves - as David Keys explains . A team of archaeologists , led by Dr Mike Parker Pearson of Sheffield University , has recently found the remains of what are believed to be two mummified Bronze Age bodies , buried under the floor of a prehistoric house at Cladh Hallan on the Hebridean Island of South Uist . The house in which the mummy skeletons were buried was part of a unique Bronze Age complex , which is as mysterious as the preserved corpses that were buried there . The skeletons looked very unusual ... like Peruvian mummies The find is the first evidence of deliberate mummification carried out in ancient times ever found in Britain - and is without doubt one of the most important archaeological discoveries made in recent years . No mummified body tissue had survived - so it was not immediately obvious to the excavators what they had found , when they first came across two skeletons at Cladh Hallan . They did , however , think the skeletons looked very unusual , being very highly flexed , like Peruvian mummies . The sinews and skin had been deliberately preserved Several months of detailed scientific tests followed , including radio carbon dating of the bones and of other materials from the site . The first suggestion that the skeletons had actually come from mummified bodies arose when the radio carbon dates came back from the laboratory . To the astonishment of the archaeologists , they saw that one individual ( a male ) had died in around 1,600 BC - but had been buried a full six centuries later , in around 1,000 BC . What is more , a second individual ( a female ) had died in around 1,300 BC - and had had to wait 300 years before being interred . The archaeologists thought this strange . They had never encountered anything like it before . If the skeletons had been left unburied for 600 or 300 years they would have ended up as just a pile of bones . It seemed that perhaps in some way the sinews and skin had been deliberately preserved , to permanently hold the skeletons together . The researchers began to wonder whether they had come across Britain 's first mummies . Next came the second piece of startling evidence . If indeed the uncovered bones had once belonged to mummified bodies , then how had the mummification been carried out ? Bearing in mind the technologies and resources available in Britain during the Bronze Age , there were three main options . Firstly there was the possibility that the bodies had been smoked to preserve them . Certainly people of the Bronze Age had the technology for that procedure , and indeed the archaeologists discovered a smokery on the Clad Hallan site - but it dated from 1100 and 800 years , respectively , after the individuals had died .

Certainly people of the Bronze Age had the technology for that procedure , and indeed the archaeologists discovered a smokery on the Clad Hallan site - but it dated from 1100 and 800 years , respectively , after the individuals had died . Secondly , the bodies could have been wind - dried , and there is certainly prehistoric archaeological evidence that shows that people in some parts of Scotland 's Western Isles did use wind - drying techniques to preserve meat ( especially large sea birds ) , in ancient and in later times . Whether their killers intended ( them to ) be preserved for eternity is not known Thirdly , the South Uist bodies could have been preserved by being placed temporarily in a peat bog . It is known that prehistoric people knew the preservative properties of certain types of peat bog and that they used it , in later prehistory , in Scotland and Ireland to preserve butter and tallow . What 's more , the bodies of sacrificial or ritual murder victims ( mainly from the Iron Age ) have been found preserved in peat bogs in Britain and in continental Europe . Whether their killers intended that their victims should be preserved for eternity , however , is not known . It was this third option that was most easy to test for , using modern forensic techniques . When a body is placed in the right sort of peat bog , its skin and sinews are tanned in much the same way that animal skin is turned into leather . The bone is also altered , and it becomes demineralised . The longer it is kept in the peat bog , the deeper into the bone the demineralisation process penetrates . If a peat bog had been used simply to preserve an individual sufficiently to keep the skeleton permanently in place ( ie to preserve the person 's skin and sinews ) , then the body would only have needed to stay in the bog for between 6 and 18 months , and that would have resulted in the demineralisation of only the outer few millimetres of bone . Extraordinarily , that is precisely what the forensic tests showed had occurred . The scientific analysis revealed that just the outer 2 mm of the bone had been demineralised . Lastly , subsequent forensic tests revealed a third and final piece of evidence for mummification . Lastly , subsequent forensic tests revealed a third and final piece of evidence for mummification . The technique used to reveal this is based on the fact that , after death , the bacteria in the gut start devouring the body and attacking the skeleton . The bacterial onslaught changes the bone by riddling it with tiny holes . The degree of bacterial damage can then be tested to a high degree of accuracy by a forensic procedure known to scientists as mercury porosimetry . The corpses had not been allowed to decompose for long A piece of bone , the volume of which has been very accurately measured , is placed inside a container of known volume . Mercury is then forced into the container under pressure . Some of the mercury enters the tiny holes made by the bacteria - and the scientists can then measure how much mercury has penetrated into the bone and therefore how much bacterial attack took place . In the case of the two South Uist skeletons , the test revealed a very low level of bacterial attack - a level consistent with the body being placed in a peat bog a day or two after death . The test suggested very strongly that the corpses had not been allowed to decompose for long . It indicated that the process of decomposition had been halted at an early stage - presumably when the body was placed in the peat bog , or perhaps if it had been eviscerated prior to immersion in the bog . The archaeologists have now virtually proved that the two South Uist skeletons came from mummified bodies - and that they had remained unburied for 600 and 300 years respectively . But why their contemporaries wanted to mummify them is a complete mystery . The archaeologists have now virtually proved that the two South Uist skeletons came from mummified bodies - and that they had remained unburied for 600 and 300 years respectively . But why their contemporaries wanted to mummify them is a complete mystery . Motives for body preservation vary from place to place and period to period around the world . In ancient Egypt , people were mummified in order to help them attain eternal life . In ancient Peru , the Inca emperors were mummified so that they could continue to play their part in society . Indeed their mummified corpses even attended special state banquets . It is conceivable that the ... mummies were important ancestral figures In the Amazon jungle some tribes ' mummified ' the heads of their enemies and kept them in their own homes - where their identity and spiritual strength could be expropriated by the kin of those who had killed them . In Tibet and Japan holy men were mummified , while in various other areas revered ancestors were preserved for posterity - and no doubt consulted on important tribal matters . In prehistoric Britain there was a tradition of reverence towards ancestors , so it is conceivable that the South Uist mummies were important ancestral figures . As such , the tribe or clan may have seen them as having had protective powers or even the ability to intervene with the gods or cosmic spirits on behalf of their people . It is probable that the preserved bodies were kept over the centuries in some sort of mummy house - a special dwelling to accommodate ancestors , probably both male and female . But in a sense the role the mummies performed is only part of the conundrum of Cladh Hallan . The complex was made up of seven houses arranged as a terrace . The archaeologists have so far excavated three of them - and the dig has revealed that the structures were used not just as dwellings but also as places of ritual activity . The complex was made up of seven houses arranged as a terrace . The archaeologists have so far excavated three of them - and the dig has revealed that the structures were used not just as dwellings but also as places of ritual activity . When the complex was constructed in around 1,000 BC , the two by then rather ancient mummies , along with the body of an entire sheep ( possibly a sacrifice ) , were buried under the floor of the most northerly house . At around the same time an unmummified 13 - year - old girl who had recently died was buried under the floor of the middle house . Underneath the southernmost of the three excavated structures , a three month old child was also interred around 1,000 BC . Also round 1,000 , in the northernmost structure , a ritual was carried out in which large quantities of pottery were deliberately smashed . Over the next few hundred years rituals continued in the northern and middle structures . A few years or decades later the cremated bones of some children were interred in the northern house ( the one with the mummies under the floor ) . Then a couple of decades later still , more cremated children 's bones were deposited in the house , along with several deliberately smashed pots and three smashed quern stones . A group of unfired smashed pots was then stacked up against the inside of the house wall and subsequently the entire house was moved one metre east and rebuilt , with a bronze bracelet being deposited , probably to mark the occasion . At around the same time the southern house was dismantled . Over the next few hundred years rituals continued in the northern and middle structures . In around 900 BC , for instance , a baby was buried in the north house and the building was again moved and rebuilt - this time two metres further west . Over the years , in the two remaining houses , more pottery was deliberately smashed , and antlers , pots and bone tools were buried . More animals were also sacrificed - a sheep and two dogs . After several more deconstruction and reconstruction episodes , the north house was finally abandoned in around 700 BC - but the middle structure continued in ritual use until around 400 BC , making it the longest used house known from British prehistory .

The Dutch pair followed up their 2010 success in the tournament - when van Barneveld partnered Co Stompe to the PDC 's inaugural World Cup pairs win - by taking victory in this year 's \u00a3 200,000 , 32 - nation event in style . Having seen off Italy , Spain and Belgium earlier in the tournament , they were narrow semi-final winners against Northern Ireland on Sunday night before going on to claim the title . World Champion van Gerwen had been defeated 4 - 3 by Brendan Dolan in their semi-final Singles contest , only for van Barneveld to whitewash Michael Mansell before the pair teamed up to win the Doubles decider 4 - 0 with an incredible 117.88 average , the highest ever seen in the tournament . They took that form into the final as van Gerwen whitewashed Phil Taylor in the opening Singles game with a 103 average before van Barneveld powered past Lewis without dropping a leg . Van Gerwen then defeated Lewis 4 - 2 in their Singles clash as he secured a 3 - 0 victory for the Netherlands in the final - meaning that their nation holds the World Championship , Premier League Darts and bwin World Cup of Darts titles ! \" This is a very special moment for us , \" said World Champion van Gerwen . \" This is a fantastic title because I 've never won this , and we worked very hard for this . \" I enjoyed every moment of the tournament and to win the final against England is amazing for us and I think we deserved the title because we worked so well as a team . \" We played really well today , especially against Belgium and Ireland in the Doubles games , and then we walked over England in the final with some awesome darts . \" I started off very well against Phil and to win 4 - 0 and for Raymond to beat Adrian 4 - 0 was very good for our confidence , and I knew I had to turn up against Adrian . I did that and we won the title , and we 'll enjoy this moment . \" Van Barneveld , who won the Premier League Darts title last month , added : \" We 're really happy and this win means a lot to us but also means a lot for darts in Holland . This is a fantastic event and we 're over the moon to win this title . \" We had tough battles against Belgium and Ireland but even when Michael lost a couple of Singles games we still believed in each other and in the Doubles games against Belgium and Ireland we were awesome . \" There 's no better player in the world to team up with and I enjoyed every single match in this tournament . \" England had seen off Australia 4 - 0 in their Doubles decider in the semi-finals as they booked a spot in the final , with Taylor having swept aside Simon Whitlock 4 - 1 before Paul Nicholson overcame Lewis 4 - 2 to send the tie all the way . However , their challenge ran out of steam in the final as the Dutch claimed three successive Singles victories to end England 's hopes of claiming a title hat-trick in Hamburg . \" We got to the final and gave ourselves a chance but we were beaten by the better team tonight , \" said Taylor . \" We tried everything but Michael 's finishing was brilliant - I do n't think he missed a thing in the final - and Barney played well too . It 's disappointing for us but we 'll be back next year and hopefully we can win back the title . \" Australia , the 2012 finalists , had to settle for a second semi-final defeat as Whitlock and Nicholson 's bid for glory came up short against England .

The airplanes all have wings with 12 engines on them , and the blimps are so big that they have landing fields on top of them , where baby blimps are tethered . Everything looks vaguely like one of those green plastic kitchen radios they made in the late 1940s . If you like McCall 's work , you may like certain scenes in \" Sky Bandits . \" If not , you wo n't . The design of the airplanes in this movie is its single , lonely , redeeming facet . Everything else is surprisingly boring , given the fact that the movie cost a reported $ 17 million to make . The plot involves aerial battles in World War I , but the dialogue rolls along at about the level and intensity of a couple of fraternity kids making plans for the weekend . The story begins in about 1917 with the two heroes , Barney ( Scott McGinnis ) and Luke ( Jeff Osterhage ) , blowing up banks in the West . They keep using too much dynamite , so the banks get blowed up real good , ho , ho . We know we 're in trouble when this joke is repeated four times . Then Barney and Luke are mustered into the Army and sent to France , where they shoot down an airplane with their pistols and are promoted to pilot training . Meanwhile , we begin to see the weird flying machines . Some of them have four wings , others have eight engines and one is an automobile with wings bolted to it . The Germans unveil their secret weapon : a dirigible so large that when it is moored to the ground its upper reaches disappear into the clouds . Barney and Luke are assigned to find the airship and destroy it . So off they go , flying missions inside the dirigible 's hanger . It is so large that when their planes almost hit the girders and then fly out through a hole in the wall , we are seized with a burning conviction that the makers of \" Sky Bandits \" have seen \" Star Wars \" many times . You know what I feel like recounting this plot ? I feel like kindly old Uncle Don , the geezer on the radio who used to tell adven ture tales to the kids . Barney and Luke decide to drop dynamite on the big dirigible , and imagine their surprise when .... But you get the point . Anachronism fans may be mildly amused by the conversations held by the two characters , who are alleged to be 1917 cowboys , but who do not in any detail of their appearance , speech or manner , appear to be anything other than two out - of - work actors engaged to make a dumb special - effects movie in Spain . The airships look great . They 're a reminder of the wonderous things that can be done with matte shots and scale models . Nothing human in this picture engaged my interest , however , and so I was left to reflect on the plight of Yvette ( Valerie Steffen ) and Mitsou ( Ingrid Held ) , the two women in the story . They 're local groupies who are picked up one night by Barney and Luke and immediately move into their tents at the air base ( the commanding officer is rather permissive ) . Then their duties consist of standing around disconsolately , looking up at the sky after their departed masters . ( A dog played this role more touchingly in \" Battle of Britain . \" ) There 's not a second of passion or real caring between the women and their lovers . At the end of the film , Barney and Luke are back out West again , blowing up more banks with more dynamite , ho , ho , and the plot has dropped the women cold . There 's not even a mention of their fate . Maybe we 'll get a sequel , \" The Bitter Tears of Fighter Ace Widows , \" in which Yvette and Mitsou mope around the deserted airfield , wrapped in castoff parachute cloth and refusing to believe reports that the war is over . 105 minutes Ingrid Held as Mitsou Jeff Osterhage as Luke Miles Anderson as Bannock Valerie Steffen as Yvette Ronald Lacey as Fritz Scott McGinnis as Barney <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Place\": [\"Sky Bandits\"], \"Event\": [\"the dialogue\"]}"}

The Ottoman Empire occupied Albania for about five hundred years . 1912 : Albania declared its statehood . 1939 : Italy invaded Albania with the primarily purpose of gaining control over 200 kilometers of Albanian road , in preparation for an attack on Greece . 1944 : Enver Hoxha came to power . Under Hoxha 's socialist dictatorship Albania was almost entirely isolated from the rest of the world . Mid 1970s : Northern European countries initiated tougher immigration policies and immigration to Italy increased . 1985 : Hoxha died and was succeeded by Ramiz Ajia . August 1989 : Jerry Masslo , a South African tomato picker and local activist for immigrant rights was shot to death in the southern Italian town Villa Literno . Although the national debate provoked by the murder initially focused on raci sm , immigration reform came to be considered pivotal in combating racism ( Stille , 32 ) . Claudio Martelli , then Deputy Prime Minister , led a movement to legislate immigration . January 1990 : The \" Martelli \" law went into effect , closing the country to further immigration . The law was an attempt to control and monitor immigration and thus to pave the way for the institution of a quota system . It stipulated that any immigrant - legal or illegal - who could prove that he or she had come into the country before the end of 1989 be granted a two year residency permit . July 1990 : Over 4,000 Albanians sought refuge in Italy ( Veugelers , 46 ) ; the Martelli law was suspended to accommodate 800 refuge seekers ( Campani , 526 ) . November 27 , 1990 : Italy signed the Schengen Treaty , which allows European Community citizens unrestricted travel within the Community . Because signatories of the Schengen Treaty are required to implement strict immigration legislation , Italy signed only after having passed the Martelli law . December 1990 : Albanian students protested against the one - party system led by Hoxha 's heir Ajia . March 1991 : The first democratic elections were held in Albania , and Aija 's socialist dictatorship crumbled . 24,000 Albanian refugees arrived in Italy within the span of three days , and the Martelli law was suspended again to grant the m asylum . April 1991 : Ministry for Italians Communities Abroad and for Immigration was formed . The Ministry placed the Albanians who arrived in March throughout Italy and provided them with work permits . The initial enthusiasm with which the Alba nians were welcomed waned . The Ministry declared that \" Italy is not a country of immigration \" ( Campani , 527 ) , and modified the Martelli law facilitate the expulsion of immigrants . August 7 - 8 , 1991 : More than 15,000 Albanians docked at Bari and were met by riot squads . They were detained in a stadium with no bathrooms . Helicopters dropped off food and water . The Albanians rioted and destroyed the stadium . Five day s later most were given $ 40 , and a new T-shirt and pants and were airlifted back to Albania ( Economist , Aug.17 , 1991 ) . Altogether , 17,466 Albanians were deported during the third week of August 1991 ( Economist , Aug. 17 , 1991 ) . Italy promised $ 70 in aid to Albania ( Veugelers , 46 ) . June 1992 : The Ministry for Italian Communities Abroad and for Immigration was dissolved ( Campani , 526 ) . 1992 : Berisha was elected president of Albania . The economy , based largely on Western aid and money from emigrants , began improve . 1996 : Italy was struggling to achieve the economic requirements for admittance into the European Monetary Union . January 1997 : Albanian financial pyramid schemes collapsed . In the political protests that followed armories were looted . Rebels seized control over cities in southern Albania . Western countries used military tactics to withdraw their nationals . Italy , anticipating another influx of Albanians , increased border patrol and requested that the European Community to address the crisis in Albania . March 1997 : Italy instituted a tough patrol of the Adriatic . Albanians who reached Italy and could prove that they would be in grave danger should they return to Albania were granted two months in Italy . On Good Friday an Albanian ship , the Kader I Rades , sank after colliding with an Italian patrol ship . Eighty Albanians were killed . 1997 : Italian led the United Nations \" military humanitarian mission \" in Albania .

The <event> shutdown <\/event> of the other reactors then proceeded badly , and problems began to cascade . \" 16:00 : The Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency of Japan ( NISA ) initiates an emergency headquarters in an attempt to gather information on the 55 nuclear reactors in Japan . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Timeline : Japan power plant crisis - Published There are fears about the safety of Japan 's nuclear power stations . The authorities are working to prevent a second explosion at the Fukushima nuclear power station , where there was a huge blast on Saturday . An emergency has also been declared at the Onagawa nuclear plant , after high radiation levels were detected . BBC News looks at what has happened . Friday , 11 March : 1446 local time ( 0546 GMT ) The 8.9 - magnitude earthquake strikes off the coast of Honshu island at a depth of about 24km . The tremor triggers the automatic shutdown of 11 of the nation 's nuclear power reactors , including reactor units 1 ,2 and 3 at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant . Reactor units 4 , 5 and 6 were undergoing routine inspections , so were not operating . The quake causes the power station to be cut off from the national electricity grid . The plant 's operators , Tokyo Electric Power Co ( Tepco ) , find that the diesel - powered emergency generators for units 1 and 2 are not working and notify government officials . 1541 : Tepco reports that the emergency generators for reactor units 1 , 2 and 3 have failed - some reports suggest that the diesel - powered back - up systems are affected by the tsunami . In the following hours , engineers attempt to install mobile power units to replace the diesel systems and manage to stabilise conditions at units 2 and 3 , but not at unit 1 . 1600 : Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency ( Nisa ) sets up an emergency headquarters to gather information on potential damage to the nation 's 55 nuclear reactors . 1930 : Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano announces that Prime Minister Naoto Kan has declared a \" nuclear emergency status \" . Officials reassure people that this is standard procedure in events like this and no radioactive material has been detected in the area surrounding the power station . 2100 : Residents within a 3 km radius of the power station are told to leave their homes , while those within a 10 km radius are told to stay at home in case it is necessary to extend the evacuation area . Following the automatic shutdown of the reactors , and the failure of emergency generators , pressure in the unit builds up as a result of the pumps in the cooling system not working properly . The pressure is the result of the reactor 's residual \" decay \" heat causing the coolant , which is not being circulated , to evaporate . The consequent increase in pressure in the coolant circuit can be controlled by pressure release valves , but this leads to an increase in pressure within the reactor building containment chamber . Tepco says that the pressure inside reactor unit 1 is more than twice normal levels . Saturday , 12 March : 0530 local time In order to release some of the pressure inside the reactor unit , the decision is taken to vent some of the steam , which contains a small amount of radioactive material , into the air . 0819 : An alarm alerts workers that the position of one control rod ( used to halt the reactor ) is unclear ( whether it is fully inserted into the reactor or outside the reactor , allowing it to continue generating heat ) 1009 : Tepco confirms it has released a small amount of vapour into the atmosphere to reduce pressure in reactor unit 1 . 1043 : Control rod alarm stops , and all rods are confirmed as being fully inserted . 1058 : In order to release some of pressure inside reactor unit 2 , some steam was vented into the air . Again , this contains a small amount of radioactive material . 1530 : TV cameras capture a massive explosion at the power station . The pictures appear to show that the outer structure of one of four buildings at the plant has collapsed . Tokyo Electric Power Co says four workers have been injured in the blast . 2000 : Uncertainty surrounds what was the actual cause of the explosion , and what damaged was caused by the blast . Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano confirms that the concrete building surrounding the steel reactor container has collapsed as a result of the blast , but the steel containment chamber itself had not been damaged . 2020 : Tepco begins pumping seawater , mixed with the element boron , into unit 1 's reactor . Boron is used as a shield in nuclear reactors , as it controls the nuclear reaction . Nisa confirms that monitoring systems in the area have detected presence of radioactive elements caesium - 137 and iodine - 131 in the vicinity of unit 1 . It reports an initial increase in levels of radioactivity around the plant , but says these levels have been observed to lessen . 2300 : In its latest update , the plant 's operator says : \" We are preparing to implement a measure to reduce the pressure of [ unit 3 's ] reactor containment vessels under the instruction of the national government . \" Sunday , 13 March : 0122 local time An official at Japan 's nuclear agency rates the incident at 4 on the 0 - 7 international scale of severity . The 1986 Chernobyl disaster was rated 7 , while the 1979 Three Mile Island accident was rated 5 . 0320 : The World Health Organisation says the risk to the public from the radiation leak at Fukushima is \" probably quite low \" . 0523 : The International Atomic Energy Agency says the plant 's operator has confirmed that the containment vessel around unit 1 is intact and levels of radioactivity nearby have fallen in recent hours . 0623 : An official from Nisa says the emergency cooling system at the plant 's unit 3 reactor has failed . 0752 : Tepco say it is preparing to release steam - containing a small amount of radioactive material - from unit 3 in an effort to lower the temperature inside . It is also looking for an alternative way to inject water into the reactor because without a continuous flow of water , there is a danger that the fuel rods will become exposed to the air and could melt . 0826 : Yukio Edano tells state TV the unit 3 reactor was in danger , but attempts are under way to vent steam . Subsequently , it is reported that radiation has again risen above legal safety limits around the plant . 1326 : Mr Edano says venting of unit 3 was completed at 0841 local time , but a partial meltdown in the reactor is still \" highly possible \" . 1538 : The Japanese government warns of the risk of another reactor explosion following the failure in unit 3 . But a spokesman attempts to reassure people by saying the unit is designed to protect the reactor core in the same way as unit 1 , and - so far - the radioactivity released into the environment does not pose a threat to human health . 2005 : In his latest public briefing on the situation , Mr Edano says authorities have begun injecting seawater into the unit 3 reactor to try to lower the temperature - as they did on Saturday with unit 1 . He says the water level inside is thought to be rising to more satisfactory levels , but the gauge , which seems to be broken , is not showing this . 2209 : It is reported that Tepco is planning to pump seawater into reactor number 2 at the plant - this is the first time problems have been reported with this third unit . It is worth noting that using seawater like this is terminal for a nuclear reactor . It is a last-ditch move and renders the reactor permanently unusable . 2241 : UN nuclear watchdog , the IAEA , says a state of emergency has been declared at a second Japanese nuclear power plant , Onagawa . The IAEA says high radiation levels had been found around the plant . A fire broke out in the turbine building of one the reactors at Onagawa on Friday , but was put out . 2350 : Japan 's nuclear safety agency says there is no problem with the cooling systems at the Onagawa plant . It blames the high radiation levels on radioactive releases from the Fukushima Daiichi complex . Monday , 14 March : 0053 local time Malcolm Crick , secretary of the UN Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation , tells Reuters : \" This is not a serious public health issue at the moment . It wo n't be anything like Chernobyl .

French philosopher Michel Foucault , who wrote about and gave lectures dedicated to his theory of biopolitics , wrote that it is \" to ensure , sustain , and <event> multiply <\/event> life , to put this life in order . \" <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Despite their prominence in subsequent academic writing , 1 See T Campbell & A Sitze Biopolitics : A Reader ( 2013 ) . the concepts of \u201c biopower \u201d and \u201c biopolitics \u201d are perhaps the most elusive , and arguably the most compelling ( given the attention they have subsequently received ) , concepts of Michel Foucault 's oeuvre . Within his published work , these concepts featured only in the last chapter of the slim first volume of History of Sexuality ( The Will to Knowledge : History of Sexuality Volume I 1976 ) . 2 M Foucault The Will to Knowledge : The History of Sexuality Volume 1 ( 1976 ) ( trans . R Hurley , 1998 ) . And , while biopolitics and biopower can be seen to figure within broader conceptualisations and genealogies of power and governmentality 3 It is important to note that Foucault does not discuss the relationship between biopolitics , biopower and governmentality . Instead , the link is implicitly made in his lecture courses , particularly The Birth of Biopolitics ( 1978 - 79 ) , in which he states ' I thought I could do a course on biopolitics this year ' , but qualifies this by saying that such a course could not be done without first conducting a genealogy on liberalist governmental reason . M Foucault The Birth of Biopolitics : Lectures at the Coll\u00e8ge De France 1978 - 79 ( trans . G Burchell , 2008 ) 21 - 22 . In a 1982 essay , ' The Subject and Power ' , Foucault defines \u201c governmentality \u201d as follows : ' This word ( government ) must be allowed the very broad meaning it had in the sixteenth century . ' Government ' did not refer only to political structures or to the management of states ; rather , it designated the way in which the conduct of individuals or of groups might be directed \u2013 the government of children , of souls , of communities , of the sick . It covered not only the legitimately constituted forms of political or economic subjection but also modes of action , more or less considered and calculated , that were destined to act upon the possibilities of action of other people . To govern , in this sense , is to control the possible field of action of others . ' [ 1 . M Foucault ' The Subject and Power ' ( 1982 ) in M Foucault Power : Essential Works of Foucault 1954 \u2013 1984 Volume 3 ( trans . R Hurley & Others , 2000 ) 341 . of his lecture series at the Coll\u00e8ge de France ( largely , 1975 - 76 ' Society Must be Defended '4 M Foucault ' Society Must be Defended ' Lecture Series at the Coll\u00e8ge de France , 1975 - 76 ( 2003 ) ( trans . D Macey ) . ; 1977 - 78 Security , Territory Population5 M Foucault Security , Territory , Population : Lectures at the Coll\u00e8ge de France 1977-1978 ( trans . G Burchell , 2004 ) . ; and 1978-79 The Birth of Biopolitics 6 Foucault The Birth of Biopolitics ( note 3 above ) . ) these references remain ' speculative '7 M Coleman & K Grove ' Biopolitics , Biopower , and the Return of the Sovereign ' ( 2009 ) 27 Environment and Planning D : Society & Space 489 , 490 . and incomplete , in part due to the genre of the lecture series which stand as unedited posthumous publications . 8 For a discussion on the unpublished genre of Foucault 's lecture series see B E Stone ' Defending Society from the Abnormal : The Archaeology of Bio-Power ' ( 2004 ) 1 Foucault Studies 77 . A good example of Foucault 's work on biopolitics being incomplete is the brief reference to biopolitics at the beginning of The Birth of Biopolitics course , only for the concept to receive no further direct attention . Foucault The Birth of Biopolitics ( note 3 above ) . Indeed , whether Foucault provides us with a coherent theory or concept of biopolitics is debatable . This notwithstanding , biopolitics and biopower continue to hold significant purchase in and for discussions on modern forms of governance and modes of subjectification . However , rather than taking these concepts as standalone and independent theoretical contributions , it is \u2013 as I demonstrate here \u2013 more productive to understand biopolitics and biopower as they function together with some of the other ideas related to power and governmentality which Foucault develops over the same period ( that is , the 1970s ) . Biopolitics and Biopower Let us begin with a brief definition of biopolitics and biopower , before situating these concepts within the broader context of Foucault 's oeuvre . In short , biopolitics can be understood as a political rationality which takes the administration of life and populations as its subject : ' to ensure , sustain , and multiply life , to put this life in order ' . 9 Note 2 above , 138 . Biopower thus names the way in which biopolitics is put to work in society , and involves what Foucault describes as 'a very profound transformation of [ the ] mechanisms of power ' of the Western classic age . 10 Note 2 above , 136 . In The Will to Knowledge , Foucault writes of [ A ] power that exerts a positive influence on life , that endeavours to administer , optimize , and multiply it , subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive regulations . 11 Note 2 above , 137 . Foucault is speaking here of a power he later designates as \u201c biopower \u201d , a power which \u2013significantly \u2013 has a ' positive influence on life ' ( my italics ) . This new biopower constitutes a ' profound transformation of [ the ] mechanisms of power ' insofar as it differs from what Foucault associates with ' juridico- discursive ' conceptualisations of power as repressive and negative : 12 Note 2 above , 82 . a power whose 'effects take the form of limit and lack ' . 13 Note 2 above , 83 . Indeed , Foucault conducts a lengthy critique of this repressive functioning of power in both The Will to Knowledge14 See particularly Foucault 's critique of the repressive hypothesis , note 2 above . Also discussed in length in HL Dreyfus & P Rabinow Michel Foucault : Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics ( 1982 ) . and Society Must be Defended , 15 See particularly the first two lectures ( note 4 above ) . demonstrating that such power functions to hide other productive or ' positive ' capacities of power that are also at play particularly , for example , within the capitalist governmentality of the 19th century . The new biopower operates instead through dispersed networks \u2013 what in Security , Territory , Population Foucault names the dispositif . 16 Note 5 above . This dispositif of power works from beneath , from the ' level of life ' itself , 17 Note 2 above , 137 . and , as Foucault earlier described it in Society Must Be Defended , ' [ i]t was a type of power that presupposed a closely meshed grid of material coercions rather than the physical existence of a sovereign ' . 18 Note 4 above , 36 . Importantly , biopower did not replace repressive and deductive functions of power , but worked together with such technologies of power . Foucault writes : \u201c Deduction \u201d has tended to be no longer the major form of power but merely one element among others , working to incite , reinforce , control , monitor , optimize , and organize the forces under it : a power bent on generating forces , making them grow , and ordering them , rather than one dedicated to impeding them , making them submit , or destroying them . 19 Note 2 above , 136 . However , significantly too , the structural functioning of biopower , as it operates through the dispositif where lines of power triangulate outwards , enables new kinds of resistance ; resistance which can take place at the multiple points of contact which these lines of power traverse . 20 For an important critique of Foucault 's notion of dispositif see G Deleuze ' What is a Dispositif ? ' in TJ Armstrong Michel Foucault Philosopher ( 1992 ) 159 . Genealogy of Biopower In the last chapter of The Will to Knowledge entitled ' Right of Death and Power over Life ' , Foucault provides a brief genealogy of biopolitics . His opening sentence recalls the Schmittian view on the decisionism which determines sovereignty , 21C Schmitt , Political Theology : Four Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty ( 1922 ) ( trans . George Schwab , 1985 ) . speaking of how ' [ f ] or a long time , one of the characteristic privileges of sovereign power was the right to decide life and death ' . 22 Note 2 above , 135 . This sovereign power was of a juridical form . It was a power over life which could only be attested ' through the death he was capable of requiring ' . 23 Note 2 above , 136 . Thus , as Foucault notes , sovereign juridical power was in fact only a power to ' take life or let live ' , 24 Note 2 above , 136 . whereas biopower constituted 'a power to foster life or disallow it to the point of death ' . 25 Note 2 above , 138 . In the 17th century the sovereign - juridical form of power began to transform . Foucault traces the evolution of two forms of power which ' were not antithetical ' to each other , constituting ' two poles of development linked together by a whole intermediary cluster of relations ' . 26 Note 2 above , 139 . The first pole was disciplinary power , an analysis of which Foucault had developed in his previous publication Discipline and Punish ( 1975 ) , 27 M Foucault Discipline and Punish : The Birth of the Prison ( 1975 ) ( trans . A Sheridan , 1995 ) . and <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Difference\": [], \"Final_number\": [], \"Initial_number\": [], \"Initial_state\": [], \"Final_state\": [], \"Time\": [], \"Place\": [], \"Set\": [\"life\"]}"}

A federal grand jury in Kansas City , Kan. , handed up the indictments Wednesday . Frear , who resigned in August just before football practices were to begin for the Spires , is charged with one count of sexually exploiting minors by possessing a visual depiction of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct ; and two counts of sexually exploiting minors by sending via computer visual depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct . The crimes are alleged to have occurred during July and August 2005 in Leavenworth County . In a statement issued Wednesday , the university said it was made aware on Aug.16 , 2005 , that federal authorities were investigating Frear . That morning , the university said , Frear submitted his resignation and has not been on campus since collecting his personal possessions . There was no explanation given at the time for Frear 's resignation . The university said there was no evidence the alleged activities occurred on campus or using university equipment . \u201c We received confirmation from authorities that none of the suspected activity ever took place on our campus . We have fully cooperated in the investigation , \u201d said Sister Diane Steele , president of the university . Frear could not be reached for comment . If convicted , Frear faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in federal prison and a fine up to $ 250,000 on the possession charge ; and not less than 5 years and not more than 20 years in federal prison and a fine up to $ 250,000 on each of the charges of sending child pornography via computer , the U.S. Attorney 's Office said . Frear was hired at Saint Mary in December 2001 , and after his first season at the school he was named Coach of the Year by the Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference .

Ramiro and Felicita Romo knew watching their grandson make his debut as the Dallas Cowboys ' starting quarterback would be emotional , and they wanted to share the moment in solitude . \" There were some tears , \" Felicita Romo said . \" No , a lot of tears . \" It was a like a sue\u00f1o , a dream , for the Romos , who lived in San Antonio for three years before moving to the East Texas town of Crockett in 1989 . But the image of No. 9 walking up to the line of scrimmage to take his first snap confirmed what they had known for days : Their nieto , grandson , was quarterbacking the team with the star on the helmet . \" I thought of how far we 've come , not only as a family , but as a people , \" Ramiro , 73 , said in Spanish this week via phone . \" I remembered the hard times in Mexico and how I struggled when I first got here . It 's like coming from zero to where we are today . All of that went through my mind . \" Felicita left Tony a phone message , as she has done throughout his football career , on Sunday before he helped lead the Cowboys to a 35 - 14 victory over the Carolina Panthers . \" Tony is a very spiritual person , \" Felicita , 72 , said . \" I always leave him a scripture on his message machine before a game . Tony always has been very close to us . He 's always been very attentive , loving . \" Cowboys fans clamoring to learn more about the team 's new starting quarterback , who was christened Antonio Ramiro Romo , may be surprised to learn his paternal grandparents have deep ties to San Antonio and South Texas . Ramiro Romo Sr. was born in Musquis , Coahuila , Mexico , in 1933 , but moved to San Antonio when he was a teenager . He spent about five years in the city before going to live with a brother in Racine , Wis. , where he met his future wife . Ramiro Romo 's only living sibling , sister Socorro Valdez , lives in San Antonio , as do numerous nephews and nieces . Felicita Rios Romo was born in Robstown in 1934 and moved to Racine with her family when she was 12 . Felicita is called \" Phyllis \" by most of her friends in Crockett . Married for 51 years , the Romos lived in San Antonio , where they owned two restaurants on the South Side , from 1986 until they moved to Crockett in 1989 . \" We still have a lot of family and many friends in San Antonio , \" Felicita said . Crockett is about 110 miles north of Houston and 160 miles south of Dallas . The grandparents go to every Cowboys home game . The Romos , who were married in Wisconsin in 1955 and lived in the state until 1980 , are bilingual . They also have an adopted son , Mustafa John , 39 , who lives in Appleton , Wis . That a Mexican immigrant would someday have a grandson quarterbacking one of the most glamorous teams in pro sports , Ramiro and Felicita said , is a testament to the power of the American dream . \" I've always said this is a country of opportunities , \" Ramiro said . \" If you do n't get a job or an education , it 's because you do n't want to . \" His parents ' humble background , Ramiro Romo Jr. said , has made Tony 's success more gratifying . \" Only in America , \" he said . Although Tony speaks very little Spanish \u2014 he can sing \" La Bamba \" with his grandfather accompanying him on the guitar \u2014 his abuelos and father said he takes pride in his ethnicity . \" That 's a topic we 've talked about a number of times , \" Ramiro Jr. said . \" I've told Tony that there are some bad people out there who sometimes judge you , or get a certain perspective of you , by your name . But you should n't be ashamed of who you are . \" Tony is fiercely proud of being an Hispanic and carrying the Romo name . I 've always told him , ' Be who you are and be proud of it .

Dr. Theodore Karasik , a security analyst with Dubai-based think tank INEGMA , said the retraction was common in a legal system that can assign blame to victims of sexual assault . \" It 's the nature of the law . The status here is that if a female is caught having illegal sex , no matter what the instance , this is seen as haram [ forbidden ] , \" he said .

We have Spike Lee to thank for popularizing this politically incorrect but very useful term . Lee used it in a 2001 appearances at college campuses . He was blasting a then - recent wave of such characters , played by the likes of Cuba Gooding Jr. , in \" What Dreams May Come \" ( a spirit guide helping Robin Williams rescue his wife from Hell ) , Will Smith in \" The Legend of Bagger Vance \" ( a sherpa - on - the - green , mentoring Matt Damon 's golfer ) , Laurence Fishburne in \" The Matrix \" ( Obi - Wan to Keanu Reeves ' Luke Skywalker ) and Michael Clarke Duncan in \" The Green Mile \" ( a gentle giant on death row whose touch heals white folks ' illnesses ) . The word choice is deliberately anachronistic -- \" negro \" started to fall out of fashion about 40 years ago . But that 's why it 's so devastating . The word \" negro \" was a transitional word that fell between the white - comforting \" colored \" and the more militantly self-determined and oppositional \" black . \" It asked for dignity and autonomy without going that extra step asserting that it existed anyway , with or without white America 's approval . \" Negro \" fits the sorts of characters that incensed Lee . Even though the movies take pains to insist that the African - American character is as much a flesh - and - blood person as the white hero , the relationship is that of a master and servant . And not a real servant , either : one that really , truly lives to serve , has no life to speak of beyond his service to Da Man , and never seems to trouble himself with doubts about the cause to which he 's devoting his time and energy . \" How is it that black people have these powers but they use them for the benefit of white people ? \" Lee asked sarcastically . The Magical Negro character ( or as Lee called him , the \" super-duper magical negro \" ) was n't invented in the 1990s . He 's been around for at least 100 years , accumulating enough examples ( from Uncle Remus in \" Song of the South \" through the clock - keeper played by Bill Cobbs in \" The Hudsucker Proxy \" ) to merit snarky lists , an entry in the urban dictionary and a detailed Wikipedia page ( turns out Stephen King 's fiction has been a magical negro factory ) . The term gained an even wider audience when a candidate to chair the Republican National Committee mailed out a song titled \" Barack the Magic Negro , \" with lyrics to the tune of the Peter , Paul and Mary hit . Outraged liberals focused on the surface racism encoded in the song title , ignoring the possibility that the song , however lead - footed in its humor , was rooted in something real . What got lost in the flap over the song was the phrase 's relevance to Obama 's candidacy : There was ( among Democrats , at least ) a widespread sense that replacing George W. Bush with the Illinois senator would send a definitive signal that everything was different now , that it was time to rebuild , repair , rejuvenate and move forward , not just toward a post - Bush society , but a post-racial one . It was an absurd hope , one that Obama himself seemed to resist endorsing at first , only to relent and begin publicly playing up his pioneer status as the first not-entirely - Caucasian man to pursue and then win the Democratic presidential nomination . Frequent Salon commenter David Ehrenstein tackled this subject in a memorable 2007 Los Angeles Times piece that called Obama a \" magic negro \" almost a year before that RNC ditty appeared . Likening Obama to a spiritual descendant of the noble , kindhearted , often sexless black men portrayed by pioneering leading man Sidney Poitier , he wrote , \" Like a comic -book superhero , Obama is there to help , out of the sheer goodness of a heart we need not know or understand . For as with all Magic Negroes , the less real he seems , the more desirable he becomes . \" Suffice to say Obama 's election triggered a paroxysm of paranoia , insecurity and rage in roughly half the population ( maybe more , if polls on immigration and the Park51 project are to be believed ) . These flare - ups of privilege ( wherein an almost entirely white sector of the populace descended from once- despised immigrants embraces the idea that \" we \" have to protect or reclaim \" our \" country from \" them \" ) cast retrospective light on the Magical Negro resurgence , which flowered in earnest during the last Democratic administration and has been going full -steam ever since . Between demographers ' projections of a 21st - century majority - minority swap , Clinton 's unprecedented ( un-presidented ? ) comfort with African - American culture ( which he made official during the 1992 campaign , in an effective bit of pandering stagecraft , by playing sax on \" The Arsenio Hall Show \" ) , and hip - hop 's supplanting rock as the country 's unofficial national soundtrack , there was a sense , even in the pre-Internet era , that the white man either was n't in control anymore or soon would n't be . Whitey was just going to have to deal . Things have n't played out quite so simply , of course . In every aspect of quality of life that can be measured , nonwhite folks have always tended to be worse off than whites . That has n't changed in the aughts , and the recession \/ depression has hit black men especially hard . Looking back over the last 20 years worth of cultural and demographic unrest , the M.N. phenomenon seems a form of psychological jujitsu -- one that takes a subject that some white folks find unpleasant or even troubling to ponder ( justifiably resentful black people 's status in a country that , 50 years after the start of the modern civil rights struggle , is still run by , and mostly for , whites ) and turns it into a source of gentle reassurance . Do \" they \" hate us ? Oh , no ! In fact , deep down they want \" us \" to succeed , and are happy to help \" us \" succeed , as long as we listen well and are polite . That 's why Whoopi Goldberg put her life on hold to help Demi Moore get in touch with her dead boyfriend in \" Ghost , \" and Jennifer Hudson lived to serve Sarah Jessica Parker in the first \" Sex and the City \" movie . And it 's why Danny Glover 's character -- one of but a few black men in an otherwise white town -- takes such a keen interest in the life of a bantamweight high school wrestler who has apparently lived in the same town with Harry his entire life and recognizes him as a local eccentric , yet never bothered to get to know him before now . People that enjoyed \" Legendary \" may say I 'm being unfair to Harry , that there 's more to him than Magical Negro-hood . And yes , it 's true , at the end -- spoiler alert ! -- we 're told that he 's not just a gravel - voiced sweetheart who likes to hang out by the local creek , catching fish and dispensing words of wisdom . He 's actually quite influential -- not literally magical , but nevertheless demi-godlike in his influence over the town and its history . But the specifics of Harry 's character do n't refute the label ; quite the contrary . The revelation of Harry 's influence is a nifty trick , one that 's common in nearly all movies featuring nonwhite mentor \/ sidekick \/ deus ex machina characters . It seems appealing enough in the abstract . But it 's weak soup when you look at such a character 's role in the totality of the story . Danny Glover , arguably one of cinema 's most versatile and likable character actors , gets to play something close to God ( he even narrates the story and turns out to have had a hand in three generations of local lives ) . But he does n't get a good scene with anybody but the hero , does n't get even the intimation of a private life , and barely speaks to anyone in the town that supposedly adores and respects him . Like the clock - tender in \" The Hudsucker Proxy , \" the HIV - stricken painter \/ saint from \" In America , \" and Ben Vereen 's characters in \" Pippin \" and \" All That Jazz , \" Harry 's aura of omnipotence is compensation for being shut out of the movie . It 's a screenwriter 's distraction that obscures the character 's detachment from the heart of the narrative -- and the character 's essentially decorative nature . Like the hot-tempered black police captain who demands the maverick white detective 's badge and the stern black woman judge who dresses down the kooky but irresponsible white heroine and warns her to get her life together , the Magical Negro is a glorified walk - on role , a narrative device with a pulse . The M.N. does n't really drive the story , but is a glorified hood ornament attached to the end of a car that 's being driven by white society , vigorously turning a little steering wheel that 's not attached to anything . Which might be a harsh but accurate metaphor for our current president , come to think of it . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Speaker\": [\"a \\\" Magical Negro\"], \"Time\": [\"at least 100 years\"], \"Experiencer\": [\"some white folks\"], \"Situation\": [\"in a country that , 50 years after the start of the modern civil rights struggle , is still run by , and mostly for , whites\"], \"Message\": [\"they want \\\" us \\\" to succeed , and are happy to help \\\" us \\\" succeed\"]}"}

Drip marketing is distinct from other database marketing in two ways : ( 1 ) the timing of the messages follow a pre-determined course ; ( 2 ) the messages are dripped in a series applicable to a specific behavior or status of the <event> recipient <\/event> . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Drip Marketing : Slow and Steady Wins the Customer Drip marketing is the rather inelegant term for a marketing campaign that relies on repeated contact , or \" touches , \" with a potential customer . Unlike a leaky faucet , drip marketing is no accident . Successful drip marketing involves a carefully planned and thoughtfully targeted series of communications that will get your message across to customers and keep your company 's name in their minds . As prospects move through the early stages of the sell cycle , drip marketing helps ensure that those potential customers become your actual customers . Advantages Building awareness is one of the most important advantages of drip marketing . It fixes your company name and message in the potential customer 's mind . Education is another important function . Drip marketing can inform prospects about your products and your industry by giving useful information while building trust in your company . Who It 's Good For Drip marketing is ideal for high - value products with a long sell cycle , especially high - ticket items which are purchased at infrequent intervals . For example , mortgage companies and real estate agencies are big on drip marketing . So are health and life insurance agents . IT vendors whose products are purchased at infrequent intervals are also a rich market for drip marketers . Drip marketing is especially effective if you have some insight into the prospect 's buying cycle . Some kinds of goods , such as business computers and automobiles , tend to have a definite lifespan and are replaced every few years . Aim Your Drips Drip marketing needs careful planning for maximum effect . You must decide on a basic theme or themes that you want your campaign to drive home . But the same message endlessly repeated loses effectiveness . Even though the themes remain the same , drip marketing requires variation in the way you present the message . Kissing the Minimum Number of Frogs On a percentage basis , drip marketing is not very efficient . It requires you to contact a number of people a number of times to drive sales . This does n't mean drip marketing ca n't generate a lot of sales . Properly done , it can turn up many good prospects . But it does mean that you need to carefully focus your drip-marketing efforts . Paradoxically , while drip marketing uses mass - marketing techniques like email and direct mail , it becomes most effective when the messages are customized for specific audiences . Once you 've decided on your basic themes , you need to analyze your prospect list to determine which presentations are likely to be most effective with different groups . For example , a real estate agency will have some potential clients who are buying their first homes , some who are retiring and looking to downsize and some who are moving into the area . Each of these groups will benefit from a different approach . First- time buyers are likely to be interested in affordability . Older prospects looking to downsize will probably be more concerned about issues like tax implications and how to handle the sale of their existing home . By segmenting your prospects , you can provide them with the appropriate series of messages . Drip Systems Fortunately , drip marketing lends itself to a high degree of automation . Equally fortunately , there are a number of tools to help you run a drip- marketing campaign , or alternatively a number of companies who will run your campaign for you . Many drip-marketing products are specialized for particular industries . For example Norvax Inc. 's Lead Miner is designed for insurance agencies selling health insurance . Agent 360 from RENWare Inc. is designed for real estate agents . Other software programs , such as Swiftpage , are more general and will work for many kinds of businesses . Beyond the industries they serve , drip products vary enormously in what they do . In fact , drip marketing is more a buzzword than a product description . One must look beyond the term to see what a product actually offers . The most basic drip marketing products are email auto-responders . These simply send a reply , or a series of replies , to queries emailed to your business . Even within this category there is variation . Some of these products , like Swiftpage , automatically assemble a leads database in addition to sending out email messages . Others , such as TriggerTouch , will start with visitor information from your Web site . Most of these programs will send a series of messages , spaced over a period of weeks or months , in response to an initial query . In effect , they automatically launch a drip marketing campaign aimed at the potential customer . The more sophisticated programs allow you to vary the content of the messages as well as their timing depending on your evaluation of the contact . Some of them even have advanced features : LeadMiner can automatically generate current quotes to be included in the emails . But drip marketing can be much more than just email . It can also include direct mail contact , newsletters , telephone calls or on - site visits . In fact , just about any form of customer communication can be integrated into a drip-marketing campaign . Some drip-marketing software will also automatically remind you to call the lead or send out mailings . Some CRM programs , such as ACT4 Advisors , which is built on Sage Software Inc. 's ACT ! CRM program , come with features that let you set up a drip-marketing program . In the case of ACT ! that includes a series of sample letters on various topics . Finally , there are a number of companies that specialize in running drip-marketing campaigns , such as MyMarketing Partner Inc . They can help you create your message and analyze your prospects , and can provide you with prewritten or customizable materials aimed at the various target groups . You work out the basics and they do the rest . Avoid the Spam Trap Badly done drip marketing is Chinese water torture for prospects . They may remember you , but they 're unlikely to deal with you . Bombarding prospects with uninteresting or irrelevant messages is a great way to end up being ignored . In this day of spam filters and floods of junk mail , it 's all too easy to wind up as part of the background noise rather than a signal . Email marketing is a particularly tricky business because of spam 's current choke hold on email campaigns . In fact , most people who get a message from a company with whom they 're not familiar are likely to assume it 's spam . Another problem with email marketing is that malicious emails have made people wary of opening attachments such as newsletters or reports . The basic way around this problem is content combined with trust . To overcome the spam barrier you need an interesting message . You have to say something in which your potential customers are likely to be interested . Often that means giving them tips or other useful information . Second , you need to build trust . Your prospects must trust you to give them something they want and not send them viruses . This is one limit for sending newsletters as attachments to emails . Personalization also builds trust , both in your emails and in your company . As much as possible , include your prospects ' names and other information \u2014 correct information \u2014 showing that they 're not just a name on a mailing list . Also include information about who you are . For example , an email signed by the sales rep who will handle the account is more effective , especially if the email is from that rep 's own email account . Customizing on the Cheap The big advantage of drip marketing is that it gives you a relatively low-cost , low- effort way of maintaining regular contact with leads who have n't yet made the critical buying decision . You can do this by other means , of course , but drip marketing lets you touch a lot more people effectively without wasting a lot of work . With drip marketing you can have more contact with more prospects without overloading your sales force or breaking your budget . Comments - Posted by Mark Nov 23 , 2008 We have several different drip campaigns depending on the prospect . It 's all automated and has definitely helped . We will schedule a \" Cold series \" for prospects that we have to abandon . The emails keep us in front of that prospect for months and it invariably leads to a renewed interest . Maybe the timing did n't work out at first but now , because they know more about us , we get a the call . Works great .

Bialik , like other great literary figures from the early part of the 20th century such as Ahad Ha - Am and Tchernichovsky , spent his last years in Tel Aviv , and exerted a great influence on younger Hebrew writers ; the impact of his work is evident throughout modern Hebrew literature . Plenn , Matt . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Hayim Nahman Bialik was born on January 9 , 1873 in Radi , a small town in the Ukraine . When he was five , his father 's business failed and the family moved to Zhitomir , the capital of Volhynia . Two years later his father died and his mother , unable to support the family , handed the children over to other relatives . Early Years Bialik was raised by his grandfather , a wealthy businessman and religious Jew who imposed a strict Jewish education on his wild and undisciplined grandchild . By the age of 13 , Bialik had the reputation of an ilui\u2013an intellectual prodigy \u2013and was consulted on questions of Jewish law . At 17 , he left to attend the famous yeshiva at Volozhin . There , he wrote his first poems and became attracted to the secular- nationalist writings of Ahad Ha'am . Bialik soon became a full - fledged Zionist and \u2013without telling his grandfather\u2013left the yeshiva in the hopes of attending university or a modern rabbinical seminary . Bialik traveled to Odessa \u2013 the center of the new , secular Jewish culture . There he met Ahad Ha'am , Moshe Leib Lilienblum , and other cultural Zionist leaders . He began publishing\u2013one of his first poems was El Ha-Tzippor ( \" To the Bird \" ) , a lyric of longing for Zion\u2013and was soon recognized as his generation 's most promising Hebrew poet . In 1893 , Bialik returned to Zhitomir to marry Manya Averbuch and work for his father - in - law as a timber merchant . Alone in the forest for days on end , Bialik wrote prolifically . Alongside poems with pronounced nationalist themes , such as \" Blessing of the Nation , \" he produced \" Ha -Matmid , \" a depiction of a yeshiva student , in which Bialik worked through the theme of self - denial in pursuit of a higher ideal . In 1897 , after the collapse of the family business , Bialik moved to Sosnowiec , a town on the Prussian border , and from there , in 1900 , back to Odessa . After working as a teacher and a merchant , in 1903 Bialik was appointed the joint editor of Ha-Shiloah , a Hebrew periodical founded by Ahad Ha'am . Following the first Zionist Congress of 1897 , Hebrew poetry took on new importance , and despite the fact that most of his poems articulated not hope but grief and despair , Bialik was hailed as a prophet of Jewish nationalism . City of Slaughter In 1903 , Bialik was commissioned by the Jewish Historical Society of Odessa to travel to Kishinev , a town in Bessarabia ( now Moldova ) where in the course of a three day pogrom 47 Jews had been murdered . His experience interviewing the survivors led him to write the epic \" City of Slaughter , \" which reflects the poet 's bitterness at the absence of justice and the indifference of nature , but also attacks the Jews who had done nothing to defend themselves in the face of the violence . The poem reads : To the graveyard , beggars ! Dig up the bones of martyred father and brother , fill your sacks , sling them on backs And hit the road to do business at all the fairs ; advertise yourselves at the crossroads so everyone sees , in the sunshine on filthy rags spread the bones and sing your hoarse beggar song , beg the decency of the world ! Beg the pity of goyim ! Eternal beggars ! Bialik 's criticism resonated with the Zionist goal of effecting a revolutionary transformation of the Jews into a proud , even warlike , nation . The poem circulated in Hebrew and Yiddish versions , as well as in a Russian translation by Revisionist Zionist leader Vladimir Jabotinsky . In these years , Bialik realized his full power as a poet , raising Hebrew lyric to the level of the great European romantic poets . Alongside \" City of Slaughter \" and other \" poems of wrath , \" whose inflammatory tones influenced not only Zionists but a generation of Jewish Communist revolutionaries , Bialik composed poems about nature and lost love . Yet even his love poetry was marked by disgust and despair at the failure of passion : I was innocent , no storm of lust had fouled me Till you came . I , foolish boy , cast down at your feet , mercilessly , my purity of heart and soul , the tender flowers of my youth . ( From Hungry Eyes , 1897 ) Confession of Loss In 1905 , Bialik published \" Scroll of Fire , \" a nine section experimental prose poem . The poem weaves Talmudic legends into a romantic allegory of national and personal trauma . \" Scroll of Fire \" begins with a powerful depiction of the destruction of the ancient Temple , yet the poem was also inspired by the burning of Odessa in 1905 , the memory of childhood fires , and an intense extramarital relationship . Drawing on a Talmudic legend and the Song of Songs , Bialik describes the words of the last surviving boy\u2013a character representing Hope\u2013to the only girl not to commit suicide in the wake of the catastrophe : All my life my soul cried out to you in a thousand voices , and in tens of thousands of ways , crooked and invisible , fled from you to you Even as a baby in the black of night , I saw your beauty and covered your hidden light \u2026 With the sorrow of a mother the golden light of your eye rested on me \u2026 at night like a weaned child on his mother 's lap I made my love known and I waited . \" Scroll of Fire \" is a confession of loss , and reflects Bialik 's ambivalence about his public role . It begins with a national catastrophe but uses this event to address deeply personal issues , and articulates the poet 's guilt about subordinating a greater issue to a merely \u2013 but more powerfully \u2013 personal event . Bialik 's writing was influenced by many factors happening around him : the ambiance of the Russian Pale of Settlement , the new traditions of hasidism and haskalah ( Jewish Enlightenment ) , the Romantic Movement , ongoing anti-Semitism , and growing Zionism . His poetry was marked , perhaps above all , by the use of a sweeping array of Jewish sources , from the Bible , through Talmud and Midrash , to medieval and modern poetry . These sources were quoted and paraphrased , often ironically or in a misplaced context , to achieve artistic richness and to thrill an audience itself imbued with a deep knowledge of the tradition . Bialik 's primary literary influence was the pioneer of Hebrew and Yiddish fiction , Mendele Mokher Sefarim ( S.J. Abramowitz ) . The older writer shared Bialik 's experience of orphanhood and abandonment by his mother , and the two developed a close emotional bond . On the ideological front , Bialik was decisively inspired by Ahad Ha'am and his calls for a Jewish cultural renaissance . Some have argued that the poet 's creativity was stunted by Ahad Ha'am 's didactic , ideological approach to art . Forays into Publishing Bialik 's poetic output dropped off in 1906 as he focused on his publishing business . He began to collaborate with Y.H. Ravnitzky on Sefer Ha-Aggadah , a comprehensive compilation of legends culled from Talmudic and midrashic literature . The book was part of Bialik 's project of kinnus , or ingathering , an attempt to collect the fragments of Jewish literature from all countries of Diaspora . He believed they would bring about an emergent Jewish national consciousness . But Bialik 's conflicted preference for the personal over the public found expression again during a visit to Israel in 1909 . He tried to give readings of his more personal work , but audiences insisted on hearing his poetry of hope and national revival . The acclaim he received aroused the same bitter feelings evident in many of his poems . As he wrote to his wife from Jaffa , \" The people regard me as someone worthy of respect , but I know that I am a nothing , a nobody . \" Bialik 's despair grew . As he wrote to a friend in 1909 , \" Sometimes I think I 'm going mad . I lack nothing , it seems , but I have no peace of mind . What is it ? I do n't know . Big and little sins gnaw at me like worms . At night I do n't sleep . I 'm worn out by ugly idleness , and I feel that I 'm wallowing in a filthy pit . \" In \" A Twig Fell \u201d ( 1911 ) , the poet is obsessed with death , seeing himself as a broken , useless twig , hanging from a branch . Dramatic historical events of 1917 - 1920 \u2013 the Bolshevik revolution , the Balfour Declaration , and pogroms that swept Eastern Europe in the wake of the First World War\u2013prompted Bialik to leave Russia . He traveled to Berlin and in 1924 settled in Palestine . Lasting Legacy In Tel Aviv , Bialik reorganized his life . He reestablished the publishing house he had started in Odessa , served on the board of the Hebrew University and as the honorary president of the Hebrew Writers ' Union , and traveled to the United States as an emissary for the World Zionist Organization . He edited collections by the medieval Hebrew poets Moses ibn Ezra and Solomon ibn Gabirol , and he published poems , songs , and reworkings of biblical stories for children . Bialik has influenced entire generations of Zionists , including tens of thousands who were exposed to his poetry as part of the Israeli school curriculum . He wrote Hebrew poetry at a time when it was far from clear that Hebrew would become the spoken language of the Jewish community in Israel . His experiments in rhyme and meter \u2013he pioneered free verse and prose poetry in Modern Hebrew\u2013opened up possibilities for the future development of Hebrew literature , and his impact is felt in the work of almost every subsequent writer , from Agnon and Joseph Hayim Brenner through to Uri Zvi Greenberg , Natan Zach and Yehuda Amichai . Although many of Bialik 's personal poems have been misinterpreted in the light of nationalist preoccupations , his power as a poet comes from the force of personal trauma that underlies his poetry 's national themes . He speaks for his exiled , traumatized people out of his own personal biography of abandonment and separation . In 1934 , Bialik published Orphanhood , a four - part recreation of his life 's greatest trauma : the loss of his mother and father . A few weeks later , on July 4 , 1934 , he died of a heart attack while visiting Vienna <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Agent\": [\"Hayim Nahman Bialik\"], \"Place\": [\"the famous yeshiva at Volozhin\", \"Odessa\", \"Zhitomir\", \"Sosnowiec\", \"Kishinev\", \"Tel Aviv\"], \"Cause\": [\"Hebrew poetry\"], \"Time\": [\"at a time when it was far from clear that Hebrew would become the spoken language of the Jewish community in Israel\"], \"Entity\": [\"Hebrew\"]}"}

One of the Firefly 's four crew had been decapitated and two others were in shock , but Gorman was able to <event> remove <\/event> the body and take command of the tank . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Sir John Gorman , who has died aged 91 , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service , which he demonstrated in winning the Irish Guards ' first Military Cross during a tank action in the Normandy campaign . After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation , then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive . Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party , and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assembly 's suspension in 2002 . John Reginald Gorman was born on February 1 1923 at Mullaghmore House , Co Tyrone . Both sides of his family were Catholics and Unionists . His father , an RUC district inspector , had won an MC while serving in Palestine during the First World War and , as a member of the Royal Irish Constabulary , had handed over the Phoenix Park barracks to Michael Collins after the 1921 Anglo - Irish treaty \u2014 after which he moved north . Having been educated by Loretto nuns at Omagh , John was sent to the Imperial Service College at Windsor . After war broke out in 1939 he attended Portrora Royal School , Enniskillen , which was then a firmly Anglican establishment and the Province 's leading public school . Despite the school 's religious ethos , Gorman never found his Catholicism a source of trouble or comment . Commissioned into the Irish Guards in 1942 , Gorman first experienced action as a tank commander during Operation Goodwood on July 18 1944 . At Cagny , five miles from Caen , Gorman 's troop was confronted by four enemy tanks , among them a King Tiger whose gun was aimed at one of Gorman 's tanks . He had previously told his driver , Corporal James Baron , that if they were to encounter any of the feared Tigers , \u201c The only thing we can do is to use naval tactics \u2014 if the 88 mm gun is pointing away from us , we shall have to use the speed of the Sherman and ram it . \u201d The Sherman duly crashed through a hedge and careered down the slope at 40mph towards the King Tiger . With 75 yards to go before impact , the Sherman 's gunner , Guardsman Scholes , fired a high - explosive shell at the King Tiger , but it failed to penetrate the armour . Sir John Gorman 's autobiography , published in 2002 The British tank struck the King Tiger hard on its right track , and both crews bailed out . The Sherman 's front gunner , Guardsman Agnew , mistakenly took refuge in a ditch with the German crew ; on realising his error , he saluted smartly and disappeared into a cornfield to rejoin his comrades . Having led his men to safety behind a hedge , Gorman raced 400 yards to leap into a lone Firefly tank , where one crew member had been decapitated and two others were in shock . The vehicle was still workable so , after removing the body and wiping the blood from the gun sights , Gorman fired its gun to disable the Tiger and his own tank , before driving behind three more Tigers to score two hits . He then carried three burning men from another Sherman to an aid post . For this action , Gorman was recommended for an Immediate MC and Baron for a Military Medal . Both men were presented with their medals in the field by General Montgomery . Outside Brussels the regiment was greeted by jubilant crowds , and an elderly woman presented Gorman with a copy of Some Experiences of an Irish RM , which had been left at her parents ' house by another Irish Guardsman in 1914 . But the war was not yet over , and Gorman , by now a captain , attended the briefing on the impending Arnhem campaign given by Lieutenant - General Sir Brian Horrocks , the Corps Commander . When Horrocks announced that the \u201c honour of leading this great dash which may end the war \u201d would be given to the Irish Guards , Gorman expostulated : \u201c Oh , my God , not again ! \u201d Gorman and his troop crossed the Nijmegen bridge before the advance was called off . Having left the Army in the rank of captain in 1946 , Gorman joined the RUC and became a district inspector in Antrim . There , in 1947 , he came into conflict with the young Ian Paisley , who had objected to a proposed Roman Catholic pilgrimage to a holy well at Rasharkin . Gorman gave the procession an RUC guard on the Feast of the Assumption . In 1955 he was moved , as district inspector , to Armagh where , shortly after his arrival , he and an Army officer , Major Brian Clark , helped to disarm a young fusilier who had gone berserk . Gorman suggested to Clark that their exploit was worth a medal \u2014 but only one . They tossed a coin for the honour and in due course Clark , on Gorman 's recommendation , was awarded the George Medal . Later , with the approval of the Archbishop of Armagh , Cardinal D'Alton , Gorman uncovered an IRA bomb -making factory in the Catholic Cathedral , which led to the arrest of three armed gunmen hiding in the confessionals . During the IRA 's border campaign in the 1950s Gorman acted as a liaison officer with MI5 and MI6 , and in 1960 his security contacts put his name forward for the position of chief of security at BOAC . One of his first duties was to supervise the security arrangements for the royal tour of Pakistan , Nepal and Iran in 1961 , at the end of which he was appointed CVO . He was later promoted the airline 's head of personnel , with a seat on the board . In 1968 he moved to become the airline 's manager in Canada , and , from 1975 , in India , Bangladesh and Sri Lanka . In 1979 Gorman returned to his native province to become deputy chairman and chief executive of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive , the country 's largest owner of public housing . He succeeded in cleaning up corruption and selling off council houses , and in 1986 became part-time director of the Institute of Directors in Northern Ireland , an office he held until 1995 . In 1990 he aroused controversy when he invited the Irish Taoiseach , Charles Haughey , to address an IoD meeting in Belfast , in Haughey 's capacity as President of the European Union . Prominent among opponents of the visit was the Unionist politician David Trimble . None the less , after Trimble 's election as Ulster Unionist leader in 1995 , Gorman joined the UUP , and in 1996 was nominated by his party as a member of the Northern Ireland Forum for Political Dialogue , a body which had been set up in parallel with inter-party talks . He was subsequently chairman of the Forum , a position which he held until its last session in April 1998 . Following the Belfast Agreement of the same year , Gorman was elected as member for North Down in the new Northern Ireland Assembly , and served as a Deputy Speaker of the assembly from 2000 until its suspension in 2002 . As the lone Catholic in the Unionist camp , Gorman , with his neat military moustache , cut a somewhat idiosyncratic figure ( his opponents called him \u201c Captain Mainwaring \u201d ) . On one occasion television viewers in the Province were entertained by the astonishing spectacle of him urging the bemused Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness to blow up IRA arms in \u201c one big bang \u201d . In 2002 Gorman published an autobiography , The Times of My Life . John Gorman was appointed MBE in 1959 , CBE in 1974 and was knighted in 1998 . In 2005 he was appointed a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur . He served as High Sheriff of Belfast in 1987 - 88 . He married , in 1948 , Heather Caruth , who survives him with two daughters and a son . Another son predeceased him .

Eagle said she was surprised by her appointment as she had disagreed with Corbyn 's advocacy of unilateral nuclear <event> disarmament <\/event> and supported the renewal of the Trident nuclear weapons system . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Maria Eagle 's new House of Commons office is appropriately located . Directly opposite lies the Ministry of Defence , the department she now shadows . \u201c That 's the office we want , \u201d she says , gesturing towards the neoclassical edifice . In her first full - length interview since accepting the post , Eagle concedes that she was \u201c a bit surprised \u201d to receive the job . The former minister ( she served for nine years in government and has been on the Labour front bench for 14 ) voted for Trident renewal in 2007 and remains a supporter of the UK 's nuclear weapons system , a stance antithetical to that of Jeremy Corbyn . \u201c And that 's why I made sure I said to him , ' Jeremy , you do realise that I believe in multilateral disarmament and that I 'm pro-Trident , do n't you ? ' \u201d Eagle tells me . \u201c And he said ' Yes , he did realise that ' , still offered me the job , and I thought on that basis : ' OK , he knows that , he 's not going to be surprised by my views . ' \u201d Eagle , who was elected in 1997 to represent Liverpool Garston ( now Garston and Hallwood ) , adds : \u201c He wanted to know whether I was willing to undertake a review and I said ' Yes ' , obviously . We need to have a debate about these things . And on that basis he offered me the job and on that basis I took it . \u201d For Eagle , the debate over Trident renewal is one that Labour has avoided for too long . \u201c I think there 's a mood out there for more transparency , not just in the Labour Party but in society as a whole . It 's not just in the Labour Party that the issue of defence spending is an issue . The Lib Dems had a big debate at their conference , the SNP obviously debate it all the time . \u201c I think at a time when you 've got austerity and big cuts in public expenditure it 's reasonable for people to ask whether or not the money that we 're spending on defence generally and on a successor submarine , in particular , is properly spent . \u201d The review , she pledges , will examine Trident \u201c with a completely open mind \u201d on \u201c the basis of facts and figures \u201d . Of the possibility that it could endorse unilateral disarmament , she says : \u201c I 'm not ruling it out . \u201d Eagle refuses to say whether Corbyn should grant a free vote on the issue but denounces the Conservatives as \u201c despicable \u201d for \u201c seeking to play party politics \u201d by potentially bringing forward the Commons decision to December . \u201c For a start - off , they do n't have to have a vote on this , they 've got a mandate . Since when did they decide it was necessary to have parliamentary votes on whether or not they should sign big contracts ? I do n't remember them doing it about whether or not we should get the Chinese to build nuclear power stations in Somerset . I do n't remember them doing it on whether or not we should give Virgin the East Coast franchise . \u201c If they bring that vote forward , before Christmas , that is a despicable attempt to play politics with this issue and , quite disgracefully , with our national defence at a time of increased tension abroad . . . Their cover for it is that we do n't want it to be an issue in the Scottish elections . It 's going to be an issue in the Scottish elections whether there 's a vote before or not . \u201d She adds : \u201c They 're here to exploit differences in the Labour Party . Well , we 're going to have a genuine debate about whether or not this is the right way for us to spend a significant amount of money over a significant number of years . We will have that debate properly . That kind of behaviour will be seen for what is . \u201d Labour conference delegates voted not to debate Trident at the party 's conference ( \u201c Delegates decided . . . you ca n't say that it 's been kept off the agenda , \u201d Eagle notes ) but the issue dominated the final day after Corbyn told the Today programme that there were no circumstances in which he would press the nuclear button . \u201c For a potential prime minister to answer that question in the way he did is n't helpful , it is n't helpful , \u201d Eagle says . \u201c Now , I do n't have any problem with somebody who says , ' Deterrence does n't work . ' But not everybody in the Labour Party believes that deterrence does n't work : I think it works . I think it certainly does n't work if you tell your potential enemies precisely what you are or are n't going to do in given circumstances . I did n't think it was necessary for him to answer that question . \u201d Would she press the button ? \u201c I think the key thing for deterrence is not to tell your potential enemies what you 'd do . It has to be an option , that is how deterrence works , \u201d she replies . David Cameron used his Conservative conference speech to denounce Corbyn memorably as \u201c security - threatening , terrorist - sympathising , Britain -hating \u201d . \u201c It 's conference - speech rhetoric , is n't it ? That 's what it was , it was a personal attack , \u201d says Eagle when I ask her to respond . \u201c That 's what he does , he likes personal attacks . \u201d She refuses to defend Corbyn 's statement that the assassination of Osama Bin Laden was \u201c a tragedy \u201d , which partly inspired Cameron 's attack . \u201c I 'm not here to say that Jeremy was right or wrong about anything he 's ever said ; you have to ask Jeremy to justify what he 's said about things . But I do n't think it helps to take comments out of context , is all I 'd say , I do n't think it helps . Jeremy has said many things over the years from his perspectives . There 's no point asking me whether Jeremy 's saying the right things or not . He 's saying what he thinks and that 's fair enough . \u201d Of Corbyn 's own conference speech , which MPs criticised as addressed to the hall , rather than the country , Eagle says diplomatically : \u201c He was only elected a couple of weeks before he had to make that speech . He made it in the way in which he wanted to make it and that 's fine . I 'm not interested in criticising him about what he said . \u201d Eagle tells me that she supports the 2 per cent Nato defence spending target , which the Tories have pledged to meet . \u201c I think it 's a good thing . As anybody who 's ever been a minister will tell you , one of the jobs of a cabinet minister is to fight your corner for your share of the resource . \u201d She goes on to charge the government with encouraging Russian expansionism through its defence cuts . \u201c What 's happened is not unconnected : Russian spending going up in real terms , Nato spending going down . It 's not unconnected with , ca n't be unconnected , with what we 're seeing the Russians do . \u201d Eagle and her sister , Angela , were the first twins to sit in the Commons together . After being linked with the post of shadow chancellor , Angela became shadow business secretary in the reshuffle and was hurriedly given the additional post of shadow first secretary of state after criticism of the absence of women from the four great offices of state ( leader , chancellor , home secretary , foreign secretary ) on the Labour benches . \u201c I think my sister 's brilliant . Give her the biggest job going and she 'll do it and do it well , \u201d Eagle says when I ask her about the imbroglio . \u201c Obviously it would have been easier if she 'd been shadow chancellor : I 'd have got a good settlement , \u201d she quips . \u201c Her experience and perspective on things has always been helpful to me , always . We 're very close and so that 's good , that 's good . We can be mutually supportive and we are . Without any concerns or worries about any downside . It 's pretty good being a twin , I 've always thought so . I 'd recommend it . \u201d On the day we meet there is much unease among Labour MPs about the launch of the new Corbyn-aligned group Momentum , which they fear could be used as a vehicle for the deselection of critics . \u201c It 's not clear to me precisely what it 's meant to be , so let 's see how things go , \u201d Eagle says in response . \u201c I think anything that is used in that way is n't helpful . We need to focus on the real enemy : that 's the Tories . We 're going to try and win the next election . We do n't do that by fighting each other , however that ends up happening . \u201d And does she believe Labour can win the election ? \u201c I think it 's tough . But politics is changing , there 's a lot of churn going on , there 's a lot of things happening . We 're in a time of flux . There are opportunities . The Tories may fall apart over Europe . We do n't know what 's going to happen next week , next year . Let 's not write ourselves off . Let 's turn ourselves into a fighting force to sort them out . That 's what my constituents in Liverpool want to see us doing . \u201d <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Cause\": [], \"Time\": [], \"Place\": [\"UK\"], \"Artifact\": [\"nuclear weapons\"], \"Agent\": [\"Jeremy Corbyn\"]}"}

Auto Action broke the news that Quinn was close to purchasing the circuit in April , with the GT racer now officially taking control of the day-to - day running of the circuit 45 minutes southwest of Brisbane . This morning current owner John Tetley and Tony Quinn 's signed a pact under which the latter will take over the lease , management and operations of Queensland Raceway . While Quinn 's focus is on Queensland Raceway , Tatley will focus more on the other Queensland Raceways Pty . Ltd. circuit Lakeside Park . \u201c What Tony & I have achieved with this pact is a cooperative model so that we can continue to deliver a seamless set of events for our respective customers , \u201d Tetley said . \u201c Tony can focus on expanding the scope and potential of Queensland Raceway and I can give my attention to securing the future of Lakeside and grassroots motorsport . \u201c We have moved through COVID and with the support of the two local members , Steven Miles ( Deputy Premier ) and Shane King ( Member for Kurwongbah ) along with the new CEO at Moreton Bay Regional Council , Greg Chemello , the future for Lakeside is bright again . \u201c After recent meetings with those people , and their appreciation of our contribution to the success of the Australian Paralympic cycling team , the Formula Student initiative and club charity days such as the BMW one that raised $ 10,000 for worthy causes two weeks ago ; we now have the confidence to double down on our existing $ 5 M plus investment in Lakeside . \u201d Quinn a long - time GT racer is happy to sign the agreement and believes it is the best outcome for everyone involved . \u201c The way we have set this up everybody will be a winner , \u201d Quinn said . \u201c With my experience and connections , Queensland Raceway will be firmly cemented into the position of South East Queensland 's premier motorsport facility . \u201c With the Qantas announcements last Friday the world is opening up again and we need to be ready to capitalise on both the tourism and growth opportunities that will bring . \u201c There is also an enormous Trans - Tasman synergy to be had by sharing the expertise into our Queensland and New Zealand operations . \u201c Our major contribution for QR will be to bring the experience we have with the premier events and ancillary activities that we have developed in NZ . \u201c Obviously , there will be some positive changes coming to QR next year . We are working with John on the calendar for 2022 and expect to publish it within the next few weeks . \u201c You have our commitment that we will meet the expectations of all existing QR customers in 2022 . \u201c It looks to me like everyone is a winner out of the work John and I have put in in the last five months . \u201d The Racers and Track action operations will be moved into the Lakeside offices in the future . Queensland Raceway is the most used car racing circuit in the state , as the 3.12 km circuit at Willowbank is located only 45 minutes southwest of Brisbane . It is used by Queensland - based Supercars teams as their local test track , while other local teams from other national categories continually test there . The circuit was opened in 1999 and is still the second newest perminent circuit built in the nation . Queensland Raceway hosted its first V8 Supercars round in 1999 and for several seasons hosted the pre-Bathurst 500 km race . Quinn already owns New Zealand 's Hampton Downs and Highlands Motorsport Park and did put in a bid to purchase Taupo Motorsport Park a couple of months ago . Quinn has motorsport running through his veins , a long - time Australian GT front - runner the New Zealand resident bought a 40 percent stake of Triple Eight Race Engineering earlier in the year . He also has a deal with Team Sydney , which sees his Local Legends beef jerky company on the side of Garry Jacobson 's Holden Commodore . Quinn currently owns the pocket rocket Aussie Racing Cars series and formally the GT Championship . For more of the latest motorsport news pick up the current issue of Auto Action .

These , together with the Prince of Wales ' Island ( now known as ' Penang ' ) formed the Straits Settlements . The Second Charter of Justice was issued on 27 November 1826 . This Charter abolished the Recorder 's Court , which served only the Prince of Wales ' Island , and established the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales ' Island , Singapore and Malaya . In criminal proceedings , the court was \" to administer criminal justice in such \u00a1 Manner and Form \" as the courts in England , with \" due attention being ( given ) to the several Religions , Manners and Usages of the native Inhabitants \" . The court was to \" give and pass Judgment and Sentence according to Justice and Right \" in civil proceedings . The Governor and the Resident Councillor acted as two judges of the court . The third judge was the Recorder , who was based on the Prince of Wales ' Island and had to travel on circuit to Malacca and Singapore from his home base . He was assisted in his duties by the Resident Councillors and the Governor , who sat as lay Judges . - The Third Charter of Justice of 12 August 1855 was granted to cope with the increase in the judicial workload which resulted from Singapore 's rapid development . Under the Third Charter of Justice , the Court of Judicature was reorganised into two divisions . The first division had jurisdiction over Singapore and Malacca and comprised the Recorder of Singapore , the Governor and the Resident Councillors of Singapore and Malacca . The second division had jurisdiction over the Prince of Wales ' Island and Province Wellesley , and comprised the Recorder of Prince of Wales ' Island , the Governor and the Resident Councillor of the Prince of Wales ' Island . - The Judicial Duties Act of 1867 brought about further changes to our judicial system . The Governor of the Straits Settlements ceased to be a Judge of the Court of Judicature , although the Resident Councillors continued to sit under their new title of Lieutenant - Governors . This Act also changed the titles of other officers : the \" Recorder of Singapore \" became the \" Chief Justice of the Straits Settlements \" while the \" Recorder of Prince of Wales ' Island became the \" Judge of Prince of Wales ' Island \" . Sir Peter Benson Maxwell , then the Recorder of Singapore , became the first Chief Justice of The Straits Settlements in 1867 . The Supreme Court Ordinance 1868 abolished the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales ' Island , Singapore and Malacca , replacing it with the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements . In turn , the Courts Ordinance of 1873 reconstituted the Court , so that it now consisted of the Chief Justice , the Judge of Penang , a Senior and a Junior Puisne Judge . One division of the Court sat in Singapore and Malacca , whilst another sat in Penang . In addition , the Ordinance conferred on the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements the jurisdiction to sit as a Court of Appeal , with final appeals lying to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council . Previously , appeals had lain only to the King -in-Council . Further changes to the structure of the judicial system were brought by the Courts Ordinance of 1878 . This Ordinance was passed in response to the United Kingdom Judicature Acts of 1873 - 75 , which modified the court structure in England . Under the Ordinance , the jurisdiction for the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements was brought in line with that of the new English High Court . The Courts Ordinance of 1907 allowed Judicial Commissioners of the Federated Malay States to be appointed from time to time to perform the duties of a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements . The Court of Criminal Appeal Ordinance came into force on 1 September 1934 to provide for the establishment of a Court of Criminal Appeal . This was necessary as , up till then , the Court of Appeal had exercised only appellate civil jurisdiction . - Our courts ceased to function when the Japanese invaded Singapore in 1942 and established a Military Court of Justice to administer Military Ordinances and the laws of the Japanese army . The courts were re-opened by a Proclamation dated 27 May 1942 , which stated that the courts were to follow the former system of laws insofar as they did not interfere with the Military Administration . The Syonan Supreme Court or \" Syonan Koto -Hoin \" was opened on 29 May 1942 . A court of appeal was also created , but it never sat . - Following the surrender of the Japanese on 12 September 1945 , Singapore was temporarily administered by the British Military Administration . The British Military Administration proclaimed that all Japanese Proclamations and Decrees ceased to have effect , and that \" all laws and customs existing immediately prior to the Japanese occupation will be respected \" . The British Military Administration came to an end on 31 March 1946 . The Straits Settlements were disbanded and Singapore was made a separate Crown Colony on 1 April 1946 . The Supreme Court , consisting of a High Court and a Court of Appeal , was constituted by the Singapore Colony Order in Council . The Court of Criminal Appeal continued to function . Final appeals lay to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in England . On 2 May 1955 , Mr Tan Ah Tah became the first local - born person to be appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court . Mr Frederick Arthur Chua ( appointed on 15 February 1957 ) and Mr Wee Chong Jin ( appointed on 15 August 1957 ) were appointed thereafter . Mr Wee Chong Jin was also the first local - born member of the Singapore Bar to be appointed to the Supreme Court Bench . Mr Tan Ah Tah and Mr Frederick Arthur Chua were both from the Colonial Legal Service . On 5 January 1963 , Mr Wee Chong Jin became the first Asian to be appointed the Chief Justice of the State of Singapore . His appointment marked a break in the long - standing tradition ( since 1867 ) of appointing British Chief Justices for Singapore , the last of whom was Sir Alan Rose . Singapore 's judicial system was altered once again following her merger with Malaysia on 16 September 1963 . The Federation of Malaya Act came into force on 16 September 1963 , establishing the Federal Court of Malaysia and the structure of the Malaysian judicial system . The Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act 1964 repealed the provisions relating to the Singapore Supreme Court in Singapore 's Courts Ordinance as well as the whole of the Singapore 's Court of Criminal Appeal Ordinance . The Supreme Court of the Colony of Singapore was replaced by the High Court of Malaysia in Singapore , while the Court of Appeal was assimilated into the Federal Court . The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council continued to be the final appellate court . - Although Singapore became independent on 9 August 1965 , the ties between the judicial systems of Singapore and Malaysia were not severed until 1969 . The Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1969 , re-established the Supreme Court of Singapore , comprising the High Court , the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal . Jury trials were abolished in 1969 , by an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code which provided for trials of capital offences to be heard by two judges . This arrangement continued until 18 April 1992 , when the Criminal Procedure Code was amended to allow for trials of capital offences to be heard before a single Judge . The next important milestone for Singapore 's judicial system was the introduction of Judicial Commissioners to the Supreme Court Bench , with the first Judicial Commissioner , Mr Chan Sek Keong , being appointed on 1 July 1986 . A Judicial Commissioner is appointed for specific periods of time and may exercise the powers and perform the functions of a Judge . In this capacity , he enjoys the same immunities as a Judge . On 28 September 1990 , Mr Wee Chong Jin retired as Chief Justice , and Mr Yong Pung How , took over as the head of the Judiciary . The first female to be appointed to the Supreme Court Bench was Ms Lai Siu Chiu , who was appointed a Judicial Commissioner on 2 May 1991 . Thereafter , Ms Judith Prakash was appointed a Judicial Commissioner on 1 April 1992 . They were appointed Judges of the High Court on 2 May 1994 and 1 April 1995 respectively . In 1993 , the existing appellate court , which comprised the Court of Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal , was reconstituted into a single Court of Appeal for both civil and criminal appeals . The present Court of Appeal normally comprises the Chief Justice and the Judges of Appeal , who rank above the High Court judges . A Judge of the High Court may also , on the request of the Chief Justice , sit as a Judge of the Court of Appeal . The first Judges of Appeal to be appointed were Justice M Karthigesu and Justice L P Thean , both of whom were appointed as Judges of Appeal on 1 July 1993 . The physical buildings which have represented Singapore 's legal system since the founding of Singapore in 1819 , form an important part of the country 's legal heritage . These include the former Parliament House , the Empress Place Building , the old Supreme Court Building and the City Hall . The former Parliament House , the oldest government building in Singapore , was the original courthouse used by the British from 1827 . It was designed by George Coleman and was meant as a residence for a merchant named John Argyle Maxwell . Work commenced in 1826 and the building was completed in 1827 . Maxwell then leased the building to the colonial government for 15 years at a rent of 500 rupees a month . The ownership of the courthouse was finally transferred to Governor S G Bonham and the East India Company on 10 October 1842 for 15,600 Spanish dollars . The first court session was held in the central room on the first floor at the front of the building facing High Street . In 1839 , a single storey annexe was erected on an adjacent site to serve as a new courthouse so that the whole of the old courthouse could be used to house government offices . As the new court premises lay next to a shipbuilding yard , the noise from the yard frequently drowned the addresses of the Judge or the evidence of the witnesses . In November 1854 , the Grand Jury condemned the annexe as being totally unsuitable for a Court of Justice due to the incessant clamour from the adjoining shipbuilding yard . However , nothing was done until July 1864 , when the foundation stone for a new courthouse at the Empress Place Building was laid . The new courthouse was completed in 1865 , and <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Goods\": [\"The former Parliament House\"], \"Place\": [\"Singapore\"], \"Lessor\": [\"John Argyle Maxwell\"], \"Time\": [\"in 1827\"], \"Lessee\": [\"to the colonial government\"]}"}

The latest effort , the MoMA Eve , is a handheld game player capable of playing PC games , its creator says . The Eve is not designed to directly compete with the Sony PSP and Nintendo DS , two handheld game players that were announced this week at the Electronic Entertainment Expo show in Los Angeles . Instead , the small handheld , whose styling was created by a studio headed by former Apple designer Thomas Meyerhoffer , will use a mix of proprietary game software as well as applications designed for the PC . \u201c It 's funny that you say that it comes out of nowhere , \u201d said Andrew \u201c Bunnie \u201d Hwang , the \u201c minister of mobile affairs \u201d at The Ministry of Mobile Affairs ( MoMA ) , based in San Diego . \u201c It actually fills a vacuum in the market , \u201d of an X86 - based handheld , he said . Hwang co-authored Hacking the Xbox : An Introduction to Reverse Engineering , which describes how to turn Microsoft 's gaming console into a more full - featured personal computer . The Eve 's business model is based on the content - protection model that the Xbox uses , as well as the value- added ability to remove that protection for an added fee . The Eve uses a 533 - MHz Eden -N Processor and the CN400 digital media chipset from Via Technologies , the Taiwan - based developer of low - power CPUs . Inside the Eden-N is a \u201c padlock \u201d content protection system that is designed to safeguard downloaded content . Via has partnered with AceGain , a provider of grid software solutions , to develop the GameDweller network , optimized for the download of Eve-specific games . The site is not currently providing games to consumers ; a message there says that \u201c detailed information regarding the GameDweller service is only available to approved 3rd parties \u201d . The Eve mobile console integrates the S3 Graphics UniChrome Pro IGP chip , featuring a 200 - MHz clock that can drive a pixel rate of up to 200 million pixels per second with two textures each . MPEG - 2 and MPEG - 4 video will be displayed on a 4 - inch LCD screen capable of 640\u00d7480 resolution . The Eve uses two hot-swappable lithium - ion batteries , each with a charge of about two hours , Hwang said . According to Hwang , the Eve will ship with a SIM card , the type used by some digital phones to limit access . With the SIM card inserted , the Eve will be unlocked and will allow the user to play games that have been loaded onto the console . The Eve will include a USB 2.0 port , 802.11 b wireless , as well as a Compact Flash card for portable content . Inside the handheld resides a 20 - Gbyte hard drive for storing games . If a user wishes , Hwang added , he can purchase a separate SIM card \u201c for a reasonable price \u201d that will completely unlock the console , so users can download whatever content they wish . The Eve uses an embedded version of Windows XP , so older games should run on the system , Hwang said . Via had previously been involved with the design of the ApeXtreme , a wired console that was also designed to play video games designed for the PC . After the final specifications for the ApeX were announced , however , Via 's chips had been replaced with an AMD Athlon XP and a graphics chip supplied by Nvidia Corp . The $ 499 ApeXtreme console has yet to ship . The Eve will cost under $ 500 when it ships early next year , Hwang said . Final pricing will be announced then .

He once wrote that \u201c a man 's unavoidable contradictions are his purgatory . \u201d He embodied several intriguing dualities : An ethnic Pole born and raised in Lithuania , Mi\u0142osz was a Polish Catholic who attended mass but decried Poland 's fervent and often nationalistic Catholicism , a Gnostic who greedily seized on life 's pleasures instead of renouncing them , a sensual Manichean , a doubter who once said \u201c all my intellectual impulses are religious , \u201d an exile not leftist enough for postwar Paris but too leftist for Cold War America . An odd coincidence , barely noted in the Polish press , linked Mi\u0142osz in death with a man whose path had crossed his before World War II \u2014 a man with glaring contradictions of his own , though he officially bypassed purgatory for paradise . The day that Mi\u0142osz died , August 14 , is a holiday honoring the popular but controversial Polish saint Maximilian Kolbe . The Franciscan priest , widely accused of anti-Semitism , nevertheless died in Auschwitz . Before his arrest , his monastery had sheltered several thousand Jews . The little - known connection between the two men helps illuminate one small but fascinating aspect of the life and work \u2014 the complexities and contradictions \u2014 of Mi\u0142osz , whom the exiled Russian poet Joseph Brodsky , a Nobel laureate himself , called \u201c one of the greatest poets of our time , perhaps the greatest . \u201d Born in 1911 in Lithuania , then part of the Russian empire , Mi\u0142osz was a member of the Polish -speaking gentry , the son of a civil engineer . As a young man he cofounded a literary group , \u017bagary , nicknamed \u201c The Catastrophists \u201d for their bleak view of the future and prescient sense of approaching disaster . He took a law degree in 1934 , and in 1936 , at the age of 25 , went to work for Polish National Radio 's regional station in Vilnius as a literary programmer , his first real job . Mi\u0142osz 's leftist views soon got him into trouble . In his autobiography , Native Realm : A Search for Self -Definition , published in Polish in 1959 , he describes the \u201c whisper campaign \u201d mounted against him by right - wingers , culminating in an editorial denouncing him in the enormously popular Polish newspaper Ma\u0142y Dziennik ( The Little Daily ) . \u201c [ It ] declared to the whole country that a Communist cell was operating within the Wilno [ Vilnius ] radio station , and that this cell was responsible for a Jew being entrusted with the religious programs . . . . \u201d The Little Daily and another newspaper , Rycerz Niepokalane ( The Knight of the Immaculata ) , were the publications of a religious community founded by the influential Polish priest Maximilian Kolbe . Kolbe 's brand of nationalistic religion represented everything Mi\u0142osz loathed about the politically powerful state church , which conflated Catholicism and Polish patriotism , leavening both with xenophobia and anti-Semitism . Kolbe 's defenders note that he had little control over the general editorial policy of his newspapers . He was traveling back and forth from his monastery outside Warsaw to Nagasaki , Japan , where he had established a mission , and he was in ill health besides . But there was no denying his newspapers ' anti-Semitism . He had , though , urged his editor in a memo to exhibit greater charity towards Jews : \u201c Speaking of the Jews , I would devote great attention not to stir up accidentally nor to intensify to a greater degree the hatred of our readers against them . \u201d Still , one of the references to Jews he made in the 1930s included mention of a \u201c Jewish - Masonic conspiracy \u201d and a \u201c cruel clique of Jews . \u201d Mi\u0142osz was sacked in 1937 , but hardly desolate . He recalls having had mixed feelings about his job anyway , describing it as provincial , bureaucratic , and suffocating : \u201c I swore vengeance against the nationalists , but I was basking in the sudden change of my routine , \u201d he writes in Native Realm . \u201c Once more I was master of my own time , I could lounge in bed until late , read , write , and I had the unknown before me \u2014 they had done me a good turn . \u201d He headed south for a Venetian spring , then went to work for Polish National Radio in Warsaw . In 1944 he would marry a woman he met there , Janina D\u0142uska , another happy consequence of getting fired in Vilnius . The Warsaw radio job ended with the 1939 Nazi occupation . During the early months of the war , Mi\u0142osz crossed the borders several times between Soviet-occupied Lithuania and Nazi-occupied Poland before deciding to cast his lot with Poland , predicting , correctly , that the Nazi regime was likely to end before the Soviet occupation did . He spent the rest of the war as a janitor in the Warsaw University library , reading copiously and publishing poems in the underground press \u2014 a courageous act , considering the penalties if he had been caught . But Mi\u0142osz hardly considered himself a hero . Brodsky wrote of Mi\u0142osz 's wartime experiences , \u201c Out of these ashes emerged poetry which did not so much sing of outrage and grief as whisper of the guilt of the survivor . \u201d Guilt haunts his 1943 poem \u201c Campo dei Fiori , \u201d which describes a carnival ride outside the burning Jewish Ghetto , destroyed after its inhabitants mounted an armed rebellion . In it , the poet is a bystander , a helpless , frightened , accidental witness to terrible events . The bright melody drowned Later , in Conversations with Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz , the poet called it an \u201c immoral \u201d and dishonest poem , \u201c because it was written from the point of view of an observer about people who were dying . \u201d It was too easy , he seemed to be saying : the poet observes an atrocity , writes a poem in protest , and is pleased at having written a beautiful poem ; conscience slackens . Nonetheless , such witnessing was necessary in a time when so many were silent or voiceless ; during the years of the Warsaw Ghetto , from 1941 to 1943 , about 400,000 Jews perished from disease , random executions , and deportation to death camps . \u201c To write of the tragedy of the Warsaw ghetto , to which I was an eyewitness , is hard for me , \u201d Mi\u0142osz writes in The Captive Mind , his landmark critique of totalitarianism , published in 1953 . \u201c The vision of the burning ghetto is too welded into all I lived through in my adult years for me to speak of it quietly . \u201d the salvos from the ghetto wall , and couples were flying high in the cloudless sky . At times wind from the burning would drift dark kites along and riders on the carousel caught petals in midair . That same hot wind blew open the skirts of girls and the crowds were laughing on that beautiful Warsaw Sunday . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Those dying here , the lonely forgotten by the world , our tongue becomes for them the language of an ancient planet . The carousel in \u201c Campo dei Fiori \u201d has become famous as a metaphor for human indifference . But an image from another poem of the same period , \u201c A Poor Christian Looks at the Ghetto , \u201d may capture a deeper psychological truth . Fear of judgment and damnation permeates the poem , which moves underground to the image of a \u201c guardian mole \u201d who \u201c distinguishes human ashes by their luminous vapor . \u201d I am afraid , so afraid of the guardian mole . Again , the poet is looking rather than acting . \u201c To live with one 's cowardice is bitter , \u201d Mi\u0142osz writes in Native Realm . \u201c There would be no point today in trying to convince myself or others that I had any sort of talent for heroism . I admit it openly : I turned cold with fear even at home if I happened to meet our apartment manager 's eyes with their veiled threat , know that he suspected one of our guests was a Jew . \u201d He has swollen eyelids , like a Patriarch Who has sat much in the light of candles reading the great book of the species . What will I tell him , I , a Jew of the New Testament , Waiting two thousand years for the second coming of Jesus ? My broken body will deliver me to his sight And he will count me among the helpers of death : The uncircumcised . A year after the destruction of the city 's Jewry , the Poles made a valiant but doomed attempt to free the city in the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 . In retaliation , the Germans bombed or burned the ancient capital , block by block , and murdered its citizenry while the Soviet army , watching on the other side of the Vistula , waited for the spoils . Mi\u0142osz was caught on the outskirts of the city , where the streets were under artillery fire . Hitler 's soldiers detained him in an ad hoc transit camp when he tried to return to his demolished home . He was rescued that night by a \u201c majestic , \u201d \u201c authoritative \u201d nun who insisted to the German authorities that she was his aunt . He never learned her name . Over 63 days , 18,000 Polish soldiers and as many as 200,000 civilians died . By the end of World War II , 85 percent of the elegant baroque city was destroyed . Much of Mi\u0142osz 's poetry was written \u2014 during the war , and after \u2014 expressly for \u201c you whom I could not save , \u201d the war victims he addresses in the 1945 poem \u201c Dedication \u201d : You whom I could not save In Polish , the \u201c You \u201d \u2014 the very <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Asset\": [], \"Time\": [\"1944\"], \"Patient\": [\"Mi\\u0142osz\"], \"Harmful_situation\": [\"Hitler 's soldiers detained him in an ad hoc transit camp\"], \"Place\": [\"an ad hoc transit camp\"], \"Agent\": [\"a \\u201c majestic , \\u201d \\u201c authoritative \\u201d nun\"]}"}

So we 're transferring not just the camera motion but also the performance of the actors on set onto 3D pieces of geometry so we can deform them and <event> warp <\/event> them and have our effects interact with them because the mandate is all about making it look as natural as possible , so that means a lot of optical tricks and atmosphere put in as seamlessly as possible . \" <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Jay Worth and Andrew Orloff describe some of the vfx highlights of the Fringe 's second season . With J.J. Abrams ' series , the method to the madness usually starts to emerge more clearly in the second season , which is certainly the case with Fringe , airing Thursdays on FOX at 9\/8c. Olivia ( Anna Torv ) returns from the parallel universe , and must battle shapeshifters bent on destroying one universe . William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) , the mysterious chairman of Massive Dynamic , returns as a key to understanding the meaning of the two universes . \" Obviously we had a few challenges with moving the production from New York to Vancouver , as well as a new writing staff , for the most part , \" offers Jay Worth , the overall visual effects supervisor . \" Jeff Pinker stayed on as the show runner and J.J. and Bob [ Orci ] and Alex [ Kurtzman ] and [ producer ] Bryan Burke are the over arching figure heads . But we have a whole new slew of writers and a new production team in Vancouver . When you do that , you get some continuity . But , to be honest , it was all new people once again . So in some ways , it was starting over from that standpoint . However , because I was able to keep the continuity going with our vendors [ including Zoic and Eden FX ] , I do think that that has helped the show not feel as a big of a bump from one season to the next , particularly with different crews and a different vibe a little bit . \" We 've always strived to be Cronenberg - esque in our delivery of things and have these amazingly insane things going on but also have these simple things in terms of camera and environments and be naturalistic . And that 's where the visual effects come to play . One of the privileges is that because we 're so involved with the producers and the writing of everything that we get to infuse that temperament and creative through line . So we 're all on the same page in terms of tone and story . Sometimes they even write treatments where they 'll describe someone dying in ' The Fringy way , ' and we all know what that means : ' How do you want to kill someone ? ' But because they come to us , we get to come up with ideas and creatures , even before a story point goes to the studio , which makes the creative process infinitely more fun and fulfilling . \" Andrew Orloff , Zoic 's visual effects supervisor , echoes that it has to look real -- like you really photographed it . \" What it means is that we just do n't have any shots that seemed staged for the camera or any hint of being a visual effect . One of the big effects , like the parasite that crawls out of the guy 's mouth , are interacting with actor 's performances and they 're shot with a very loose camera style and we have to have the tentacles of this creature coming out of the guy 's mouth and all the deformations that are in his stomach and in his throat and in his chest . \" And we had to create a proprietary workflow here of what we 're calling performance transfer of tracking 2D points , and putting those 2D tracked points onto the formation of 3D inter-geometry . So we 're transferring not just the camera motion but also the performance of the actors on set onto 3D pieces of geometry so we can deform them and warp them and have our effects interact with them because the mandate is all about making it look as natural as possible , so that means a lot of optical tricks and atmosphere put in as seamlessly as possible . \" Worth adds that one of the benefits this season \" is having Todd Masters of Todd Masters FX being on the practical side , which has really opened us up to doing more hands - on creature and body work , where you just know that the corpse and creatures work seamlessly with what we 're doing . That 's what I like most about episode nine with the parasite that came out of the body . We had such a good parasite to work with that we were able to design and execute a [ better result ] . \" So , aside from new twists on the trademark creepy deaths , what are some of the new wrinkles this season ? How about someone turning to ash , inspired by Worth holding the remains of his wife 's grandmother in his hands at her funeral ? \" The Ash Man definitely had its own set of challenges , \" Worth says , \" because we wanted to utilize a lot of real elements , and because we did n't have the time to do all the simulation and particle work needed to make it look real . The thing that sold The Ash Man more than anything was the aftermath shot : This half - disintegrated body with a pile of ash for the head on the ground . It ended up being a layering , compositing , tweaking challenge beyond belief . I got to shoot the elements myself and had more control over them . \" The Ash Man was arguably the most daunting effect for Zoic so far this season . \" Originally , it was supposed to be a practical effect but they could n't get it to fall in a natural way , so what we had to do was shoot the practical elements in pieces and we put them all together and timed all those plates and ended up rebuilding a significant part of it and tying it all together in CG , \" Orloff explains . \" So we took a cyberscan of the guy 's body , and on top of all the practical elements we used as a base , we had a matte painting , a reveal matte painting of the cracks that ran through the body , 3D particles of large chunks of ash falling out , 3D particles of small ash bits floating down , residual dust flying off of it and , at one point , his head falls off and crashes to the ground as ash . So we had to do a full - CG head and tumble it down the body . That was pretty complicated and entailed lots of R&D : there was 2D work in After Effects , tracking , retiming , we did a lot of CG lighting for the body parts in Maya \/ mental ray and all of the particles were a combination of Maya software , and rendered in Maya \/ mental ray . Then there was the effect of turning Bell and Bishop ( John Noble ) younger . \" The guys at Zoic had to walk a fine line between too plasticky , stretched , morph effects and something that naturalistically looks younger , \" Worth suggests . \" And we 're looking to do again in the future , but that 's all I can say . \" For Zoic , the \" youngify \" effect is a compositing approach using After Effects to lift out some of the higher frequency details from the plates . \" We 're pulling those out and doing a softened pass and then we 're using some selective roto to blend that back in and also some tracked warp to change the shape of the face to make it look younger , \" Orloff explains . Meanwhile , they 're getting very adept at their trademark effects , according to Worth . \" Now when we have to design a creature and how to ripple under someone 's skin and come out , we know what exactly what we 're doing : The efficiencies that we have this year are amazing in terms of the pipeline we have at Zoic , and the creative pipeline we have with the writers and them just trusting us . \" Bill Desowitz is senior editor of AWN & VFXWorld . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Place\": [], \"Deformer\": [\"with our vendors [ including Zoic and Eden FX\", \"Andrew Orloff\", \"we\"], \"Cause\": [\"transferring not just the camera motion but also the performance of the actors\"], \"Patient\": [\"3D pieces of geometry\"], \"Configuration\": [\"making it look as natural as possible\"]}"}

Neuropsychological assessment can test many areas of cognitive and executive functioning to determine whether a patient 's difficulty in function and behavior has a neuropsychological basis . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> What is neuropsychological assessment ? Neuropsychological assessment evaluates cognitive functioning based on an individual 's performance on objective , specialized tests . Different tests are used to evaluate specific functions ( such as processing speed , problem solving , and working memory ) . The results of these tests are interpreted to determine strengths , weaknesses , and possible brain- related conditions and neurological disorders . Neuropsychological assessment can help individuals better understand their current functioning and plan a course to recovery . Who might benefit from this type of assessment ? Individuals who have undergone , or are believed to have undergone , a brain injury will benefit from a neuropsychological assessment . This testing provides answers about a patient 's current functioning , including cognitive strengths and weaknesses . Testing also helps provide clarity about whether an individual can safely live independently , return to work or school , drive , manage his or her own household , and other similar questions about independent functioning . What kind of testing does this involve ? A full neuropsychological assessment typically consists of a combination of tests of mental capacity , including : - intelligence - attention , memory , and learning - executive function ( planning , organization , and decision - making ) - problem solving - perceptual and motor skills - academic skills - language skills - personality , emotional status , and behavior What kind of a report can I expect ? A psychodiagnostic assessment report is a comprehensive document that includes detailed results and a summary for each test , as well as a synthesis of the testing that provides a picture of neurological functioning and diagnosis . All of our reports also provide tailored recommendations based on testing results . Our team will communicate with you and your doctor to discuss results , answer questions , and review recommendations for improving cognitive functioning , emotional well - being , and recovery .

The same activists leading the protest at that time had spoken to Mayor Justin Elicker and protested outside his home two nights earlier , until 12:30 am , without incident . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> NEW HAVEN \u2014 Brad Macdowall was left thinking about contrasting emotions after Sunday night 's protest at the New Haven Police Department . He said the crowd had gathered peacefully , with hopes for changing America for the better after the death of George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police . Then officers came out to block them from entering the New Haven Police Department , ready for a confrontation , seemingly cognizant of clashes that had occurred elsewhere in the country , he said . The day , which had begun with \u201c love \u201d and \u201c positive vibes , \u201d changed startlingly quickly , he said . Macdowall , a member of the Legislative Council in Hamden , said he was pepper-sprayed Sunday afternoon , as he and other protesters moved to enter the Union Avenue station . Police Chief Otoniel Reyes said Monday that the use of force was justified , as some members of the crowd had moved forward toward the line of officers . Macdowall Wednesday described that stance as \u201c garbage , \u201d condemning New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker 's acceptance of the use of force , as well . There was no need , in Macdowall 's mind , for the police to intervene when the crowd sought to enter the building , which is currently in use . \u201c What stands out is the juxtaposition between the emotions of the protesters and the emotions of police , \u201d said Macdowall . \u201c They were ready and prepared for violence . \u201d Macdowall said that when he arrived at the station around 3:30 p.m. , he would n't have guessed the day would include violence . The vibe was peaceful , he said . The protesters came to the department as Elicker had announced he was there on Twitter . Macdowall said he was hoping to speak with the mayor . Elicker did n't come out until hours later ; the department stopped people from coming in . As officers came out to confront the group , barring the entrance to the building , they inherently escalated the situation , Macdowall said . Videos of the protest from the Connecticut Bail Fund show protesters peacefully yelling at officers , albeit with anger and emotion in their voices . Police later put on riot gear ; they were not using overtly protective clothing until some in the crowd threw batteries and plastic water bottles at them , according to past reporting . By the time Macdowall and fellow protesters decided to enter the building \u2014 announcing their intention to do so over a megaphone \u2014 Macdowall said he believed some sort of clash would happen . By the time he was \u201c one and a half \u201d steps in , he was pepper-sprayed , while a person on one side of him was shoved down the stairs and another on the other side was hit with a riot shield , he said . Video of the spraying shows organizer Kerry Ellington informing police of protesters ' intent to enter the building , saying it should be allowed as they were \u201c doing nothing wrong . \u201d \u201c They are pepper spraying , they are pepper spraying , \u201d Ellington shouted , according to video posted by the Bail Fund . The majority did not try to enter the station , the video shows . Macdowall can be seen about 30 seconds into the video at the fore of the protest , seemingly reacting to being sprayed . Members of the crowd and officers appear to push and shove one another briefly ahead of the use of pepper spray , before people turn to avoid the spray . Police had come out thinking about violence elsewhere in the country during protests over the death of George Floyd , jumping the gun on what was actually happening on the ground in New Haven , Macdowall said . \u201c ( The protest ) was peaceful . It was an open public building , \u201d said Macdowall . \u201c We should have been invited in . We should have been allowed to sit down and have a conversation . Instead they set up and premeditated violence . \u201d In so fiercely guarding the building , Macdowall said he believed the department had placed the value of property over people 's rights - a long - standing trait in American policing , he said , evidenced in part by police shootings after reported thefts , including the April 2019 shooting of Stephanie Washington by a Hamden police officer after a report of an armed robbery . Elicker said Monday that he and Chief Otoniel Reyes had discussed multiple times Sunday that officers should do \u201c everything possible to de-escalate , to not use force , to ensure that the protesters had the opportunity in every way to protest peacefully . \u201d Given damage done in other cities , the decision was made not to allow protesters to enter the police station , Elicker has said . \u201c In protecting these physical things , they 're destroying people and they 're destroying communities , \u201d said Macdowall . \u201c It 's wild to me that people do n't see that . \u201d Macdowall said he was left unsure whether policing can be sufficiently reformed to protect people of color and root out injustice without tearing down the institution . About a year and a half ago , he said , he would have said officers and others responsible for issues could be addressed within the system . But he said the racism and violence of American policing , a clear problem for decades , has been thrown into even sharper relief by the events of recent days . He said he hoped for a future where a friend like Councilman Justin Farmer could walk down a street in Hamden without suspicion , where non-militarized police placed people 's rights over property value . \u201c I want peace , \u201d said Macdowall .

Escaping <event> retribution <\/event> by CONCORD , the NPC space police force that punishes criminal activity in higher security solar systems , for criminal actions is also forbidden , as CONCORD is intentionally designed by game mechanics to be unstoppable . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> CONCORD | Crimewatch | | Legality | Timers | Consequences | CONCORD | Miscellaneous | Bounty hunting system | External links | CONCORD is a special NPC faction in EVE . In high security space \u2014 and only in high security space \u2014 they bring inevitable consequences to anyone breaking the law . In EVE 's lore , CONCORD is a regulation and policing organisation that arose from the NPC empires , but now operates independently of them . In EVE 's game mechanics , CONCORD ships will destroy player ships that carry out any aggressive actions on other players in high security space . CONCORD does not , however , exist to defend players : they simply enforce the consequences of law-breaking . EVE players can break the law in highsec at any time , as long as they accept those consequences . This distinction is paramount to understanding how the notorious highsec practice of suicide ganking functions as a valid in - game activity . The game 's looting and consequence mechanics help serve as a self - regulatory risk-versus - reward system , which makes players consider how much ISK they fit on a ship . Some modules are incredibly powerful , but also incredibly valuable and attractive to gankers . You can drastically reduce the chances of someone suicide - ganking you by not fitting too many costly modules . The guarantee of CONCORD consequences invites both gankers and their potential victims to calculate risk . Contents CONCORD mechanics CONCORD is triggered by illegal aggression in high - sec . This means that if a ship activates an offensive module on an innocent player in high - sec , a countdown timer will begin . At the end of this countdown timer , CONCORD cruisers will appear on grid and apply EWAR and capacitor warfare to the offender . A few seconds later , a CONCORD battleship will enter the grid and instantly kill any criminals . CONCORD ships do not shoot capsules , but if a criminal then boards another ship in space , CONCORD will appear and destroy that ship . The time it takes for CONCORD to react varies . The higher the security status of a star system , the lower CONCORD 's reaction time . If CONCORD units have already been triggered in the system , the reaction time also increases . Prohibited actions CONCORD will respond to the following list of player activities . - Aggressing a player who is not a legal target in high - sec - See the Timers page for details - Remote repairing NPC Ships - Activating any Remote Assistance module on a player with the Criminal flag . This includes ECCM , tracking enhancers , and remote repair modules - Attacking CONCORD & Faction Police vessels , as well as some NPCs - Having a criminal flag and jumping into High Security Space - Having low security status and jumping into a High Security System in the Sanctum Constellation ( Dotlan ) - Shooting another player 's loot ( yellow wreck ) while in high sec - See the Wreck Ownership support article for details - Shooting structures ( Upwell Structures , Starbases , etc ) unless engaged in a war with the structure owner Response details If a player performs one of the prohibited actions , as above , two CONCORD cruisers and a CONCORD battleship will warp to the location . The two cruisers have a lock time of about 2 seconds . Both cruisers will warp-scramble , web , ECM jam , sensor-damp , tracking - disrupt , and energy - neutralize any players who have taken hostile action . The cruisers will also reduce their target 's drone bandwidth to 0 . The tracking disruption means that guns can no longer be fired , though area-of - effect modules such as smartbombs and ECM bursts can still be activated while the capacitor retains sufficient energy ; a capacitor booster can inject more energy in between neut cycles . The cruisers will also shoot at the offender and each will deal about 1,000 damage every volley . 15 seconds after CONCORD has warped in , the CONCORD battleship will lock the offender and immediately destroy it unless the cruisers have done so already . Response times The CONCORD response time depends on the displayed security status ( not the real sec ) of the system and the status of CONCORD presence in the system . It is possible that CONCORD has yet to spawn in the system , has already spawned elsewhere in the system , or is already present on grid . The lock time of the CONCORD ships appears not to depend on the signature radius of the offender 's ship . The following list gives the time in seconds between the offending action and the first felt action of a CONCORD ship when CONCORD has just spawned in a system . - 0.5 : Roughly 19 seconds - 0.6 : Roughly 14 seconds - 0.7 : Roughly 10 seconds - 0.8 : Roughly 7 seconds - 0.9 and 1.0 : Roughly 6 seconds When CONCORD is already on grid , the response time is severely reduced . The response time appears to drop between 2 seconds in 1.0 security to about 8 seconds in 0.6 and 9 seconds in 0.5 . When CONCORD has already spawned elsewhere in the system but is not yet on grid , the response time is significantly increased . In this case , it will take about 19 seconds for them to arrive and start firing in a 0.6 system , and 24 seconds in a 0.5 system . If CONCORD has already spawned in the system and is not on grid , suicide gankers will have more time to apply damage . In these circumstances , it 's possible for a Thrasher to do 3,000 EHP damage in a 0.6 system . All methods of delaying CONCORD 's response are considered an exploit by CCP . However , the technique of \" pulling \" , which is the act of moving CONCORD from one location to another , is not considered a delay of CONCORD : Exploit Notification Delaying CONCORD Response CONCORD Assembly The actual CONCORD faction , an organization similar to that of a player alliance , is called CONCORD Assembly . Divisions CONCORD Assembly consists of nine divisions , similar to player corporations . | Consolidated Cooperation and Relations Command ( CONCORD ) | CONCORD was jointly formed a century ago by all the empires . The intention of it was to foster the fragile relationship between the empires and act as a meeting place where they could discuss their differences and hammer out a compromise solution . CONCORD has since taken on a life of its own , proud of its independence and determined to uphold its duties . | Directive Enforcement Department ( DED ) | The police enforcement arm of CONCORD , the DED has the responsibility of tracking down known criminals and attacking criminal facilities . They frequently operate outside empire space , wanting criminals to understand that there is nowhere safe from the long arm of the law . | Inner Circle | The Inner Circle is the top-level department of CONCORD . The policies of CONCORD are discussed and decided in Inner Circle meetings , which are usually closed to the public . At first , the members of the Circle were nominated by the empires , but now they rise from the ranks of CONCORD employees . Thus , their loyalty is no longer bound to any one empire , but rather to CONCORD itself . | Secure Commerce Commission ( SCC ) | The SCC is responsible for regulating and monitoring all trade transactions that take place on space stations . It has agents on all stations that record the transactions and they also offer courier and escrow services to make trade smooth . | Authority for Emergency Interdiction and Security ( AEGIS ) | CONCORD 's Authority for Emergency Interdiction and Security ( AEGIS ) was set up in response to increasing losses of interstellar shipping in YC120 . | CONCORD Aerospace | CONCORD 's Directive Enforcement Department became concerned early in the Drifter Crisis that its fleet of ships could no longer meet its needs . The CONCORD Aerospace division , therefore , embarked on its \" Force Majeure Program \" to develop enhanced variants . While CONCORD Aerospace successfully upgraded the DED 's stable of vessels with hyper- advanced technology , the program became a severe drain on CONCORD 's resources . Consequently , the Inner Circle authorized a limited release of CONCORD Aerospace 's designs , stripped of CONCORD 's advanced rapid-deployment and electronic warfare suites . The division was established as a subsidiary corporation to facilitate the release of these designs to the capsuleer market via authorized dealers . | CONCORD Directive Intelligence Agency ( CDIA ) | The CONCORD Directive Intelligence Agency is an offshoot of the DED that provides a range of intelligence gathering and reporting services to CONCORD . The CDIA is also known for producing the CDIA Interstellar Fact Book and its series of briefing holos for capsuleers : the CDIA Files . | Independent Gaming Commission ( IGC ) | Formed in the wake of the YC105 Amarr Succession Trials when a group of entrepreneurs at the Secure Commerce Commission realised how popular structured combat tournaments were among capsuleers , the Independent Gaming Commission has grown from a small passion project into the CONCORD Assembly 's regulatory body for all competitive sports . With its own highly skilled team of engineers and state of the art shipyards that produce low-volume , bespoke versions of the most popular hulls in the cluster as prizes , the IGC maintains a healthy bottom line from event organization , sponsorship , and adjudication across the cluster . | Project Discovery | Project Discovery 's Exoplanets Hunting Program is the primary focus of the organization since its attachment to CONCORD as an affiliated research corporation . Project Discovery was transferred to CONCORD oversight from the Sisters of EVE in July YC119 . This followed the SOE 's controversial sharing of new cloning technology , partially based on Project Discovery findings , directly with the empires , which bypassed CONCORD directives . Ships Just like any faction , CONCORD has a wide variety of ships ranging from customs officers to highly specialized combat vessels . - Shuttle : Council Diplomatic Shuttle - Frigate : Echelon - Recon Ship : Enforcer - Flag Cruiser : Monitor - Black Ops : Marshal Security vessels Whenever CONCORD needs to enforce consequences for people breaking the rules , they will send two CONCORD Police Captains and a CONCORD Police Commander for each criminal . | The CONCORD Police Captains will warp scramble , web and jam you , completely drain your capacitor as well as disabling your drones [ 1 ] . Their damage is formidable . | | The CONCORD Police Commander is unjammable and packs enough firepower to kill any ship with a single devastating shot . | - ^ Strictly speaking it is still possible to do some damage for a few more seconds until the CON <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Offender\": [\"anyone breaking the law\"], \"Avenger\": [\"CONCORD ships\"], \"Punishment\": [\"destroy player ships\"], \"Injury\": [\"aggressive actions\"], \"Injured_party\": [\"other players\"], \"Place\": [\"in high security space\"], \"Time\": [\"at any time\"]}"}

The surgery on Oct. 19 was to correct a condition called Haglund 's Deformity , a bony bump on his heel that was causing his Achilles tendon to fray . Haglund 's Deformity is thought to be congenital . Rupp has the bumps on both heels , although to this point only the left one has been an issue . Rupp , 2012 Olympic silver medalist in the 10,000 meters and 2016 bronze medalist in the marathon , said he has had the bumps on his heels as long as he can remember . But the left one had grown larger recently . Rupp 's left Achilles bothered him on and off during the runup to the Oct. 7 Chicago Marathon . He said he felt fine before and during most of the race , but the Achilles began causing him some discomfort near the end of the 26.2 - mile course . Mo Farah , Rupp 's former training partner on the Nike Oregon Project , won the Chicago Marathon in 2 hours , 5 minutes , 11 seconds . Rupp came across fifth in 2:06:21 . \" We thought we had a good plan , but the marathon itself is a different test than anything you 'll do in a workout , \" Rupp said . \" I was hoping and praying it would hold up . And , really , it did . Those other guys were better than me that day . \" Rupp 's problems began in earnest the next day , when his left foot was so swollen he had trouble walking . After consulting with his doctors , Rupp decided surgery was the best option . During the surgery Dr. Amol Saxena detached part of Rupp 's Achilles , reshaped the heel and reattached the tendon . Saxena said Rupp 's Achilles had partially torn in two places . \" He 's pretty amazing , \" Saxena said . \" I've treated almost 100 Olympians . He definitely has the highest pain threshold of anybody I 've treated . \" Had Rupp put off the surgery , Saxena said , the Achilles could have torn completely . \" It 's one of those things where it 's better to do it when you can plan it , \" Saxena said . \" Sometimes it just tears , and you ca n't plan for that . The recovery is a lot longer when you completely rupture it . \" Hopefully , it will be better than new . \" The former University of Oregon star will be on the shelf for a while . He expects to be in a cast for a month before graduating to a walking boot . He hopes to begin running in three months , although he should be able to do non-weight - bearing training before that . \" Unfortunately , there is no chance I 'll be able to run a spring marathon , \" Rupp said . If all goes well , Rupp could turn up in some track races next summer and be ready for a marathon in the fall of 2019 . In the meantime , he and his wife , Keara , are expecting the birth of their fourth child , a son , in February . \" I can help Keara this time , \" Rupp said . \" The last couple kids we 've had , I 've had to leave a week or two after they were born . \" -- Ken Goe kgoe@oregonian.com | @ KenGoe <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Place\": [\"his heel\"], \"Patient\": [\"his Achilles tendon\"], \"Time\": [\"during the runup to the Oct. 7 Chicago Marathon\"]}"}

This prompted a backlash from the district and borough councils who commissioned their own report , which argued in favour of Warwickshire being <event> split <\/event> into two unitary authorities , one for the north of the county , covering the current districts of North Warwickshire , Nuneaton and Bedworth and Rugby , and one for the south of the county , covering Warwick and Stratford districts . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Warwickshire could be split into north and south councils under new proposals . Over the last few weeks The Courier and Kenilworth Weekly News have published stories about the possibility of a unitary authority for the county - one council to reside over everything . An independent assessment of options for the biggest re-organisation of local government across the county in almost 50 years has been completed by Deloitte . Their report will be used as the basis for initial public consultations . The report was commissioned by the five district and borough councils in the county ahead of a Government White Paper on reform which is expected in the coming months . The councils have agreed to seek the public 's views before formulating proposals for change once the White Paper has been published . Deloitte found that creating two councils \u2013 north and south \u2013 would be the best way to provide better value for money , higher quality services focused on their communities . The new authorities would replace the current two -tier system in the county , where the county council is responsible for certain services such as highways , transport and social care , and the five borough and district councils are responsible for others such as planning , waste collection and leisure . Views will be sought on options for the county , including the recommended option of creating a new Unitary Council which covers the Boroughs of North Warwickshire , Nuneaton and Bedworth and Rugby , while establishing a second South Warwickshire Council covering Warwick and Stratford districts . Although the report , commissioned by the five councils , found having a single authority for the whole of Warwickshire would save marginally more money overall , different levels of council tax could remove those savings , would ' diminish local leadership ' and would ' harm the quality of service provision locally ' . While the two new unitary authorities would be separate , the report also recommended collaborative working for services such as children 's care and waste disposal , as well as becoming full members of the West Midlands Combined Authority for higher - level strategic economic development and transport . Crucially , the report found the county 's clear north- south divide in terms of the economy , health needs and demographics means having two unitary authorities would represent better value for money than having one authority controlling the whole of the county , saving more than \u00a3 25 million a year in taxpayers money , compared to the current system . In a joint statement , the five council leaders said : \u201c This is about giving our residents great value , great quality local government services , fit for the next fifty years and best able to meet whatever challenges may lie ahead for our communities . \u201c All local authorities are under financial pressure already , and COVID - 19 has only made the situation tougher . \u201c Saving our taxpayers money while delivering high quality , modern local government services is of the utmost importance . We are keen to carefully consider all the options to achieve this goal and look forward to having a meaningful discussion with those who live and work in the county about the future . If that means reorganising our two -tier system , then we will support that . \u201c Although having one authority for the whole of the county may initially save the most money , the report makes it crystal clear the needs of Warwick and Stratford 's residents are very different to those in the north of the county and , therefore , creating two unitary authorities could well be the best option for all . \u201c The county is quite unusual in the sense that the north is clearly distinct from the south in all sorts of ways . \u201c We need to make sure we are focussing the right services on the right people . \u201c This report is clear that having two separate authorities will deliver the best outcome to our residents while saving money , but we now want to test that with residents and businesses as this conversation continues . \u201c Publishing this report widely means that there can be informed discussion amongst residents and councils at all levels . \" This will help secure the best solution for the county and its residents . \u201d <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Time\": [], \"Whole\": [\"Warwickshire\"], \"Parts\": [\"into north and south councils\"], \"Cause\": [\"An independent assessment of options\"], \"Place\": [\"across the county\"], \"Agent\": [\"by the five district and borough councils in the county\"], \"Part_1\": [\"a new Unitary Council which covers the Boroughs of North Warwickshire , Nuneaton and Bedworth and Rugby\"], \"Part_2\": [\"a second South Warwickshire Council covering Warwick and Stratford districts\"]}"}

BBC News : Asian peat fires add to warming <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> | | By Paul Rincon BBC News science reporter The destruction of tropical peatlands is contributing significantly to global warming , according to a study . | | The fires can rage out of control during dry periods Peatlands in South - East Asia are being burnt in fires started with the intention to clear forest , but in dry periods they can rage out of control . This can free vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere , Dr Susan Page of Leicester University , UK , said . The peatlands , which contain up to 21 % of global land - based stores of carbon , could be destroyed by 2040 , she added . It has been calculated that in 1997 , 2.67 billion tonnes of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide were released through burning of these peatlands . This is equivalent to 40 % of one year 's global fossil fuel combustion , Dr Page says . That year was unusually high , however ; the intermediate estimate is one billion tonnes , about 15 % of fossil fuel combustion for a year . Forgotten resource Tropical peatlands are spread across numerous islands in South - East Asia , including Borneo , Sumatra and Papua . The peat is found in lowland areas , can exceed 10 m in thickness and has a high carbon content of about 60 % . Dr Page regards them as a \" Cinderella ecosystem \" ; their character and importance largely ignored by scientists , politicians and planners . | | The importance of the peatlands is largely ignored , says Dr Page The driving forces behind destruction of the peatlands have included clearance and drainage on a large - scale to set up timber , oil palm or rice plantations , and on a small - scale for subsistence farming and settlement . Poor forest management is also a cause . \" Where you 've got large - scale drainage of the peatland and clearance of the forest , the peat is far more susceptible to igniting . If you get fire escaping from plantation clearance or from farming activities the surrounding landscape is far more fire prone , \" Dr Page told the BBC News website . Restoration project On Kalimantan , the Indonesian part of Borneo , a one-million - hectare area was drained and cleared for rice cultivation , devastating the peatlands contained within it . The failed Mega Rice project under former Indonesian President Suharto 's rule was designed to create an enormous region devoted to rice cultivation . But it has since been found that the soils are unsuitable for growing the cereal crop . Although there has been some success in tackling deliberate fires , natural events are exacerbating the problem . The cleared and desiccated peatland is easily ignited during droughts , which occur every three to seven years during El Ni\u00f1o events ( the last was in 2002 ) . | | Clearance and drainage only makes the land more prone to fire Droughts can also make peat more susceptible to erosion during the rainy season . Dr Page said she was currently involved in a project to \" re - wet \" the peatlands in order to restore the water table . Without this urgent action , together with a fire control programme , the problem was only going to get worse , she added . Details of the research have been presented to the annual conference of the Royal Geographical Society ( RGS ) . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Kindler\": [], \"Cause\": [], \"Flame\": [\"The fires\"], \"Flammables\": [\"Peatlands\"], \"Time\": [\"1997\"], \"Place\": [\"across numerous islands in South - East Asia , including Borneo , Sumatra and Papua\"]}"}

He is not a three chord strummer , but is a classically trained musician , who brings to his playing and singing a dimension of Folk and Country that has brought him success in the U.S. as well as throughout Europe . He was raised in Denver , Colorado , and when he was age 13 , he and his older brother , Paul , taught themselves to play guitar . At 19 , he was studying at Colorado State College , majoring in music education . He won a national talent contest sponsored by Columbia Records and Chicago radio station WHN ( home of the Barn Dance ) , the price being a recording contract with Epic Records . He began playing the coffeehouse and campus circuit . In 1966 , he traveled to Spain to expand his guitar technique . He studied under maestros Graciano and Renata Tarrago at a conservatory in Barcelona . On returning to the U.S. , Michael played for a short while with the Back Porch Majority , who sprung out of the New Christy Minstrels . In 1967 and 1968 , he toured with the Chad Mitchell Trio , alongside another newcomer , John Denver . Michael and John wrote the song Circus together , which was recorded by both Denver and Mary Travis , from Peter , Paul and Mary . Michael and John also formed two -thirds of the short - lived successor group to the Chad Mitchell Trio , Denver , Boise and Johnson . Michael then appeared for a year in the stage production of Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris in Chicago , Los Angeles and New York . He then moved to Minnesota and , in 1971 , Michael signed to Atlantic Records . He released the album There Is A Breeze ( 1973 ) , which was produced by Peter Yarrow ( ex - Peter , Paul & Mary ) and Phil Ramone ( who would later produce Billy Joel ) , to a largely unresponsive audience . Michael 's next two albums , For All You Mad Musicians ( 1975 ) and Ai n't Dis Da Life ( 1977 ) , were both self - produced and helped to create greater interest in his live work . In 1978 , Michael came to Nashville and teamed up with producers Brent Maher ( notable for his work with the Judds ) and Steve Gibson , to record Bluer Than Blue and Almost Like Being in Love , which they intended to use to get a record deal for Michael . As a result , he signed with EMI America , and both songs were released as singles , Bluer Than Blue reaching the Top 15 on the Pop chart and Almost Like Being in Love peaking in the Top 40 on the Pop chart . He followed these with the 1979 Top 20 Pop hit This Night Wo n't Last Forever . This song was found on his next album , Dialogue . The following year , Michael had his last Pop chart hit with the low- level single You Can Call Me Blue . In 1985 , Michael recorded a duet with Sylvia entitled I Love You By Heart and it reached the Country chart Top 10 . As a result , Joe Galante signed Michael to a deal with RCA . Michael 's debut album , Wings ( 1986 ) , was marked by the twin acoustic guitars of Michael and Don Potter . His first solo single , Gotta Learn to Love Without You , was written by Michael and Kent Robbins , and reached the Top 15 on the Country list . Michael wrapped up the year with his first No. 1 , Give Me Wings , which stayed on the Country chart for over five months . As 1987 dawned , Michael followed up with another No. 1 single , The Moon Is Still Over Her Shoulder . The track was found on both the Wings album and also the new album That 's That , released in 1988 . This was followed by Ponies , which only reached the Top 30 . He finished off 1987 with the Top 5 single Crying Shame . He started off 1988 with I Will Whisper Your Name and the title track , That 's That , both of which went Top 10 . However , Michael recognized that he was still a performer who was not always acceptable to Country audiences , especially when he got away from his trademark ballads . This became apparent when , after this success , Roller Coaster Run ( Up Too Slow , Down Too Fast ) , only reached the Top 60 . Michael came to Britain as part of the CMA 's Route ' 88 with K.T. Oslin . This led to the release of the 1989 16 - track CD Life 's a Bitch , which was geared towards the European market and was a combination of his two albums on RCA plus three additional tracks , including Jacques Cousteau , which was released in Britain as a single . Since the days of heady heights , Michael continues to play solo gigs . Michael 's former session band went on the chart action as Great Plains . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Source\": [], \"Self_mover\": [\"MICHAEL JOHNSON\"], \"Time\": [\"In 1966\"], \"Place\": [\"to Spain\"]}"}

They say it was launched from near the coastal city of Sirte and aimed at Brega - currently held by rebels - but landed harmlessly in the desert . Pro-Gaddafi forces are believed to have more than 200 Scuds in their arsenal . The move comes as the rebels continue a push towards the capital , Tripoli . On Monday they advanced into two strategically important towns controlling access to the capital , from the west and the south . Fighting was reported in both Zawiya , 50 km ( 30 miles ) west of Tripoli , and Gharyan , 80 km ( 50 miles ) to the south . Medics outside Zawiya told Reuters news agency that sniper and mortar fire from government troops had left three civilians dead . ' Days numbered ' Col Gaddafi 's forces are still thought to control the Zawiya oil refinery - the only one in western Libya - where they get most of their fuel . Earlier , the rebels said they had seized Gharyan - a town in the Nafusa Mountains that straddles the road connecting Tripoli with Sabha , Sorman - west along the road from Zawiya to Tunisia - and Tiji , although this has not been confirmed by residents . If the towns fell to the rebels , they would have Tripoli surrounded by land , with Nato blocking sea access . The BBC 's Matthew Price in Tripoli says how much territory the rebels hold and for how long they can hold it is unclear . But both rebels and the US said Col Gaddafi was coming under increasing pressure . Rebel spokesman Ahmed Bani said the use of a Scud was a sign of desperation by the Libyan leader . \" This man will use any weapon necessary to keep his regime going and resume his rule , even for few hours , \" he said . \" It 's becoming increasingly clear that Gaddafi 's days are numbered , \" said White House spokesman Jay Carney . Benjamin Barber , a Libya expert and fellow at the think tank Demos , said such claims were \" wishful thinking \" . \" I do n't think there 's any particular reason for hope unless they 're willing to do a negotiated settlement , but neither the opposition council , nor Nato , nor the United States seem very interested in that right now , \" he told the BBC World Service . \" There are a great many tribes and groups in and around Tripoli whose future depends on the survival of Gaddafi , \" he added . \" I think this is more wishful thinking to cover the fact that the West , Europe , Nato , and the United States have been unwilling to make the sort of deals that were on the table that would have allowed Gaddafi to step away from power but stay in Libya . \" In an audio message broadcast on Libyan state TV on Monday , Col Gaddafi was defiant . \" The end of the coloniser is close and the end of the rats is close , \" he said . He appealed to his supporters to \" prepare for the battle to liberate \" Libya . Tunisia talks ? The Scud launch was detected by US forces , who say the missile was fired on Sunday morning and landed in the desert about 80 km ( 50 miles ) outside the strategic port of Brega . There was no word from Libyan authorities . The two sides have battled over Brega , with control swinging back and forth . Scud missiles have a range of up to about 800 km ( 500 miles ) and can carry a warhead of up to about one tonne . Earlier in the conflict the Nato-led coalition targeted rocket launchers and Scud missile containers near Sirte , saying the weapons could be used against civilians or on areas beyond Col Gaddafi 's control . Rebels denied that their National Transitional Council ( NTC ) has held talks with representatives of Col Gaddafi in Tunisia . \" There are no negotiations or talks between the Gaddafi regime and the NTC in Tunisia or anywhere else , \" Abdel Hafiz Ghoga , NTC vice - chairman , told AFP news agency . A UN special envoy , Abdul Ilah al - Khatib , whose role is to negotiate a ceasefire , has arrived in Tunis , and sources in the Tunisian security services said the two sides had met at a hotel on the Mediterranean resort island of Djerba on Sunday . A UN spokesman said he had \" no concrete information \" on any such talks . Meanwhile , the Netherlands on Monday unfroze $ 143 m ( 100 m euros ; \u00c2 \u00a3 87 m ) in seized Libyan assets and gave the funds to the World Health Organization . A spokesman for the Dutch government said the funds would be used to provide medicines and surgical equipment in areas held by rebels . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Agent\": [\"Military forces loyal to Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi\"], \"Projectile\": [\"a Scud missile\"], \"Time\": [\"in the country 's six-month conflict\"], \"Place\": [\"near the coastal city of Sirte\"]}"}

Malls in Atlanta , Chicago , and New Jersey rounded out the list of shopping areas with heavy holiday traffic . The day after Thanksgiving is often considered to be one of the busiest shopping days of the year . It earned the name \" Black Friday \" because , at one time , it was the day many retailers got back in the black . A lot of residents in the SouthPark neighborhood were n't surprised by the findings . \" I believe it . Traffic out here is pretty bad , \" said resident Matthew Milazza . Some neighbors even said they purposefully avoid the streets around the mall and other shopping areas in SouthPark . \" I'll probably try to avoid mall parking lots at all costs on Black Friday and sleep in , \" said Aaron Kaufman . The report compared Black Friday 2010 to December weekends in 2010 , and found traffic slowed by more than 25 miles per hour on Black Friday , and used that equation to quantify congestion . But some neighbors question the results . \" It 's hard to believe . There 's so many more large areas , \" said 25 - year resident Keith Eades . \" It 's a fantastic place . It 's not worst .

Wino arc fin. , and who against , the Opium War ? These are ques - tions to which a third , of infinitely greater importance \u00e2 Why should there be an Opium War ? \u00e2has this week been made sub- ordinate . The Opium War party is strong , as every war party is in this country until a succession of disasters has alarmed and dis - gusted an overwhelming majority . For note how numerous and influential are the chief gainers by war . The aristocracy\u00e2the predominant interest\u00e2the class which crowds the Church and the Bar with younger sons and needy cousins\u00e2find a vent for family hangers - on in the augmented Army and Navy . The veterans in both services rejoice in the recurrence of active employment ; and many youngsters are eager to exchange dull parades and garrison - duty for the \" rapture of the strife \" : their motives are not all sordid . The dealers in clothing , arms , and provisions , who specu- late upon profitable contracts\u00e2shipowners , who have transports ready to be hired\u00e2capitalists , who foresee the need of loans\u00e2all are ready to drive the country into a war , by which they hope to gain at the public expense . And all these parties reckon , not without cause , on the easily - excited pugnacity of the multitude . The voice of the general mercantile community ought to be for peace : but it happens that in this quarrel with China a powerful diversion in thvour of war is created by peculiar circumstances . Compensation for the opium delivered up to destruction \" for her Majesty 's service \" \u00e2valued , without interest , at about two millions and a half sterling\u00e2can only be obtained by war : so the Govern - ment assures the opium-smugglers and their agents . Upon this assurance a considerable number of London merchants , engaged in the Canton trade , were induced to sign the letter deprecating oppo- sition to the measures of Ministers , which Lord PALMERSTON used so effectively in reply to Sir JAMES GRAHAM'S motion , three weeks ago . Of course the influence of Government is used unsparingly to excite a hostile feeling against the Chinese . It is of the utmost importance to appear at any rate to carry the popular feeling along with them ; for Parliament is not responsible for the war , and Ministers dare not venture to call for a vote of approval from either branch of the Legislature . It is on their own responsibility that they have engaged the country in a contest with \" one - third of the human race . \" On the other hand , the Conservatives shrink from a sincere opposition to time war . They could stop it , but dare not . It suits not the selfish policy of their leaders to take any step which might compel them to assume office , and especially on a pledge of peace , at once balking mercantile avarice of ' its \" compensation , \" the heroes of \" the sen ices \" of their hard - won honours , and all \" the interests \" of their booty . In the face of the powerful influence , arrayed for war , and in the absence of that help which the Conservative tactics induce the present . Opposition to withhold , there is nevertheless a consider - able and a growing party in the country who cry aloud for peace and justice . It boots not to sneer at such meetings as the one held in Freemasons Hall list week . True it may be that few persons distinguished tom wealth or political influence were there . Yet we bear in mire ! that the senthnent which brought that assembly to - gether is akin to the passion ' Mitch became irresistible when di- rected against Slavery . The abuse bestowed upon it by the Downing Street newspapers proves it not to have been insignificant . It exhibited indeed , precisely that disposition which prompts dis - agreeable questions on the hustings . \" Did you vote for the Opium Wes \" will be as unpleasant an interrogatory , in sonic places we could mention , ELS any that the candidate may encounter . The War party betray soreness because of the name by which their marauding expedition to the coast of China is designated . The truth is the libel . It ' it is not a war whose origin was opium , ani whose end is opium , Ministers have writ their annals false in the Blue Book . For is it not there recorded , that the quarrels and difficulties\u00e2time cumulative case which it is now attempted to place in the ibreground\u00e2were merely incidents in the struggle on one side to exclude , and on the other to introduce opium ? Is it not the main object of the foray to China to procure the price of the opium destroyed by the Chinese authorities ? . VOI 'd JOHN RUSSELL could not deny this in the House , though neither durst he avow there what his emissaries said out of doors\u00e2that reprisals are to be made in order to obtain the means of dischargiug Cap - tain ELLIOT'S engagements . Was it not under that impresisidiona tdb the i e London m m opiu-merchants signed the document which Lord PALMERSTON read ? Not one , we are persuaded , will deny it wits Whilst our Government takes refuge in generalities , a tinct categorical statement of the wrongs for which reparation is to be sought at the cannon 's mouth is asked for in vain China has an intelligible and just ground of complaint agains ; England , in the pertinacious violation of her laws by British subjects . It may be true , thoue the Chinese are 1101 bound to believe it , that the English Government is powerless to suppress the opium-trade on the Chinese coast . It has at least power to abstain from stimulating the extensive growth and exportation of opium in India . It does not abstain . On the contrary , the Indian Government , which for many years brought opium into the market and sold it for the express purpose of being smuggled into China , has offered nearly twenty thousand chests this spring to the smugglers . And the Indian Government is but a branch of the British Government , constituted and authorized by statutes of the Imperial Parliament for a special purpose . The President of the Board of Control , an English Cabinet Minister for whose acts every one of his colleagues is responsible , virtually appoints the Governor - General and other officers of the Govern . ment in India . It is competent to Ministers to recall Lord Aucx - LAND to-morrow . It is equally competent to them to send out a despatch\u00e2or , which is the same thing , the Courts would compel the East India Directors to send out a despatch\u00e2forbidding or discoun - tenancing , instead of ' stimulating , the opium- cultivation in Bengal . To obtain a price , including a high profit , for the condemned opium , would be a definite object , though not a just ground , of war . Let the money be paid , and the fleet might return . But who has a clear notion of aoy thing beyond , to be effected by arms ? What is the amount or measure of the reparation to be sought for British \" honour \" ? What is to be done for the \" future security \" of British commerce ? Is China to be revolutionized\u00e2. to be conquered ? or is a people , numbered by hundreds of mil- lions , expected to change the customs of a thousand years to accommodate a few score English dealers ? The new recipe for stopping the slave - trade by civilizing Africa , is rational in comps . rison with this . In fine , all the alleged aims of the expedition against China are vague , illimitable , and incapable of explanation , save only that of making the Chinese pay the opium-smugglers . Therefore it is truly called THE Opium WAR , ; and never will it be known by any other name . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Path\": [], \"Time\": [], \"Goal\": [\"China\"], \"Place\": [\"China\"], \"Goods\": [\"opium\"], \"Perpetrator\": [\"the opium-smugglers\"], \"Source\": [\"London\"]}"}

The larger salt granules remain on the surface of the meat , for the most part undissolved , and absorb fluids from the meat , which are then partially reabsorbed with the salt and any added flavors , essentially <event> brining <\/event> the meat in its own juices . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> The Kosher Definition : The Hebrew word \u201c kosher \u201d means fit or proper as it relates to Jewish dietary law . Kosher foods are permitted to be eaten , and can be used as ingredients in the production of additional food items . The basic laws are of Biblical origin ( Leviticus 11 and Deuteronomy 17 ) . For thousands of years , Rabbinic scholars have interpreted these laws and applied them to contemporary situations . In addition , Rabbinic bodies enacted protective legislation to safeguard the integrity of kosher laws . Kosher Dietary Rules and Regulations . The laws of kosher are complex and extensive . The intention of this guide is to acquaint the reader with some of the fundamentals of kashrut and provide insight into its practical application . Given the complex nature of the laws of kosher , one should consult an Orthodox Rabbi whenever an issue arises . Though an ancillary hygienic benefit has been attributed to the observance of kashrut , the ultimate purpose and rationale is to conform to the Divine Will , as expressed in the Torah . Not too long ago , most food products were made in the family kitchen , or in a small factory or store in the local community . It was relatively easy to ascertain if the product was reliably kosher . If Rabbinical supervision was required , it was attended to by the Rabbi of the community , who was known to all . Today , industrialization , transcontinental shipping and mass production have created a situation where most of the foods we eat are treated , processed , cooked , canned or boxed commercially in industrial settings , which can be located hundreds or thousands of miles away from home . What adds further complication is that it is generally not possible to judge the kosher status of an item on the basis of the information provided in the ingredient declaration for a variety of reasons . First , the product may be made from kosher ingredients , but processed on non-kosher equipment . Second , the USDA does not require the listing of certain processing aids , such as pan liners and oils that serve as release agents . Though not legally classified as ingredients , these items could nonetheless render the product non-kosher . Third , many ingredients can be kosher or non-kosher , depending on their source of origin . For example , glycerin and emulsifiers are made from either vegetable ( most likely kosher ) or animal oils ( most likely non -kosher ) . Finally , many ingredients are listed only in broad terms , with no breakdown of the many complex components that make up the actual item . For example , a chocolate flavor may contain 50 ingredients , but the ingredient declaration will list this entire complex of ingredients as \u201c flavors \u201d . Unless a person is an expert in food production , the average consumer cannot possibly make an evaluation of the kosher status , which is why it is important to purchase only those products that have the endorsement of a reliable kashruth agency . Want to Apply for Kosher Certification ? Find out how to get certified here Kosher Food Kosher Meat and Non-Kosher Meat , Poultry , and Fish Meat : The Torah states that kosher mammals are those that chew their cud ( ruminants ) and are cloven-hoofed . The following animal species are among those considered to be kosher : addax , antelope , bison , cow , deer , gazelle , giraffe , goat , ibex and sheep . In addition , kosher meat and poultry require special preparation , which will be discussed below . Poultry : The Torah does not enumerate specific characteristics to distinguish permitted and forbidden birds . Instead , it enumerates 24 forbidden species of fowl , while all other birds are considered to be kosher . Nonetheless , for various reasons , in practice we eat only those birds which have an established tradition that the species is kosher . In the United States , the only poultry accepted by mainstream kashrut organizations as kosher are chicken , turkey , duck and goose . Fish : The Torah establishes two criteria to determine which fish are kosher . The fish must have fins and scales . The scales must be easily removable without damaging the skin . [ Generally , scales on kosher fish are either thin , rounded and smooth-edged ( cycloid ) or narrow segments that are similar to teeth of a comb ( ctenoid ) ] . All shellfish are prohibited . Unlike meat and poultry , fish requires no special preparation . Nonetheless , the fish scales must be visible to the consumer in order to establish the kosher status of the fish . Therefore , filleted or ground fish should not be purchased unless properly supervised , or the fillet should have a skin tab with scales attached to the flesh . Furthermore , purchasing fish in a non-kosher fish store is problematic \u2013 even if the scales are intact \u2013 because the knives and tables are not kosher , and Rabbinic guidance should therefore be sought . Fish and meat may not be eaten together , but they may be consumed as one course after the other , even at the same meal . To avoid eating them together , one should not use the same dishes or cutlery without washing them clean before one course and the next . In addition , one should eat some solid food and drink water or a beverage in between to cleanse one 's mouth of residue . Processed and smoked fish products require reliable rabbinic supervision , as do all processed foods . Meat & Poultry Processing Shechita ( Slaughter ) : The Torah requires that meat and poultry be slaughtered in a prescribed manner known as shechita . The trachea and esophagus of the animal are severed with a special razor-sharp , perfectly smooth blade , causing instantaneous death with no pain to the animal . Only a trained kosher slaughterer ( shochet ) , whose piety and expertise have been attested to by rabbinic authorities , is qualified to slaughter an animal for kosher consumption . Bedika ( Inspection ) : After the animal has been properly slaughtered , a trained inspector ( bodek ) inspects the internal organs for any physiological abnormalities that may render the animal non-kosher ( treif ) . The lungs , in particular , must be examined in order to determine that there are no adhesions ( sirchot ) , which may be indicative of a puncture in the lungs . If an adhesion is found , the bodek must further examine it carefully to determine its kosher status . It should be noted that in addition to fulfilling the requirements of halacha ( Jewish law ) , the bedika of internal organs insures a standard of quality that exceeds government requirements . Glatt Kosher : Though not all adhesions render an animal non-kosher , some Jewish communities or individuals only eat meat of an animal that has been found to be free of all adhesions on its lungs . \u201c Glatt \u201d literally means \u201c smooth \u201d , indicating that the meat comes from an animal whose lungs have been found to be free of all adhesions . Recently , the term \u201c glatt kosher \u201d is increasingly used more broadly as a generic phrase , implying that the product is kosher without question . Nikkur ( Excising ) : In some kosher animal species , many blood vessels , nerves and lobes of fat are forbidden and must be removed . There are special cutting procedures for beef , veal and lamb known as nikkur ( Hebrew word for \u201c excising \u201d ) , which must be performed by a specially trained individual . Koshering Meat : The Torah forbids the consumption of the blood of an animal . The two accepted methods of extracting blood from meat , a process referred to as \u201c kashering \u201d , are either salting or broiling . Meat should not be placed in warm water before it has been \u201c kashered \u201d . Once meat is cooked prior to kashering , it cannot be made kosher . 1 . Salting Meat : The meat must first be soaked for a half hour in cool ( not ice ) water in a utensil designated only for that purpose . After allowing for excess water to drip off the meat , the meat is thoroughly salted so that the entire surface is covered with a thin layer of salt . Only coarse salt should be used . Both sides of meat and poultry must be salted . All loose inside sections of poultry must be removed before the kashering process begins . Each part must be soaked and salted individually . If the meat or poultry was sliced during the salting process , the newly exposed surfaces of the cut must now be soaked for a half hour and salted as well . The salted meat is left for an hour on an inclined or perforated surface to allow the blood to flow down freely . The cavity of the poultry should be placed open , in a downward direction . After the salting , the meat must be thoroughly soaked , and then thoroughly washed to remove all of the applied salt . According to Jewish law , meat must be kashered within 72 hours after slaughter so as not to allow the blood to congeal . If meat has been thoroughly soaked prior to the 72 hours limit , an additional seventy - two hours time stay is granted to complete the first step of the salting process . 2 . Broiling : An alternate means of \u201c kashering \u201d meat is through broiling . Liver may only be kashered through broiling , because of the preponderance of blood in it . Both the liver and meat must first be thoroughly washed to remove all surface blood . They are then salted slightly on all sides . Subsequently , they are broiled specifically on a designated liver - broiling perforated grate over an open fire , which draws out the internal blood . When kashering liver , slits must be made in the liver prior to broiling . The meat or liver must be broiled on both sides until the outer surface appears to be dry and brown . After broiling , the meat or the liver is rinsed off . The Kosher Butcher : Years ago , salting of meat and poultry was performed in the home of the consumer . More recently , the kosher butcher performed salting in the butcher shop . Today , the entire process of slaughtering , bedika , nikkur and salting has shifted to the slaughterhouse . This allows for uniform consistency of high standards . Nonetheless , the kosher butcher plays a critical role in distributing the product . The butcher must be a person of integrity and the store should be under reliable Rabbinic supervision . Packaging : From the time of slaughter , kosher meat and poultry must be properly supervised until it reaches the consumer . A metal tag called a plumba , bearing the kosher symbol is often clamped on the meat or fowl to serve as an identifying seal of supervision . Alternatively , the meat or fowl is packed in tamper - proof packaging with the kosher logo prominently displayed . Kosher Costs : Because kosher meat and poultry have many processing requirements ( shechita , bedika nikkur and salting ) , which must be performed by specially trained individuals , the labor costs associated with kosher meat and poultry are significantly greater . This accounts for the higher cost of kosher meat and poultry . Kosher Caterers , Kosher Restaurants & Hotels : Caterers , restaurants , and hotels must be supervised by a reputable Orthodox Rabbinic authority . It cannot be assumed that kashrut is maintained simply because a kosher impression is created by an advertisement or by a statement , such as , \u201c we serve a kosher clientele . \u201d Too often , ' vegetarian ' or ' dairy ' restaurants are assumed to be kosher and beyond the need for supervision . Unfortunately , this is a prevalent misconception . Fish , baked goods , cheese , shortening , oil , eggs , margarine , dressings , and condiments are among the many foodstuffs <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Agent\": [], \"Theme\": [\"the meat\"], \"Medium\": [\"salted\"], \"Time\": [\"an hour\"], \"Place\": [\"an inclined or perforated surface\"]}"}

It is unrealistic to try to prevent entry of the organism into a cooling tower system or to create an environment that entirely precludes its growth and multiplication . However , an effective water treatment program for cooling tower legionella can help reduce the risk of Legionnaires ' disease . To learn more , contact Delta today . Click Here ! How to Prevent Legionnaires ' Disease in Cooling Towers Preventing Legionella in cooling towers is an ongoing challenge . While good maintenance of cooling towers is necessary to keep cooling tower legionella at bay , no water treatment and maintenance system is guaranteed to fully and permanently eliminate the organism . However , the benefits of proper maintenance , using cooling tower microbial control , allow the cooler tower system to operate more efficiently and have a longer lifecycle . Make Delta your cooling tower manufacturer of choice today ! Cooling Towers Are Susceptible to Legionnaires ' Disease Cooling tower systems are a concern because they contain pools of warm water that are open to the atmosphere and present perfect breeding grounds for legionella bacteria , if they are not properly cleaned , disinfected , and maintained . Therefore , the responsibility of cooling tower legionella risk assessment belongs to the facility owners or manager . There are many risk factors that can lead to hazards and the presence of legionella bacteria . Below , we list our top six and identify the measures required for prevention . Top 6 Legionnaires ' Disease Risk Factors Risk : Make - up water usually comes from a municipal or well supply but can sometimes come from a holding tank , which can contain sludge , rust , and sediment . Less commonly used , surface water that comes from lakes , rivers , or reservoirs could be full of microorganisms and nutrients from the environment . Prevention : Twice a year , the cooling tower system should be cleaned and disinfected focusing on the entire tower and any holding tank by removing any rust , sludge , and sediment . If the water is coming from a lake , river , or reservoir , antimicrobial treatments should be used before the water enters the cooling system to prevent fouling . Risk : The temperature , environmental factors , and flow velocities of cooling tower water vary as well as other parameters affecting water treatment . Prevention : The industrial or HVAC system design allows for water to circulate throughout the system whenever it is operating . System operation should be coordinated with a full chemical treatment of the water . Also , keep the system clean by removing all dirt and debris . If the cooling tower needs to be shut down for more than three days , the entire system should be drained . For metal cooling tower systems , use extra caution to ensure the free flow of water to prevent the proliferation of microorganisms responsible for corrosion and degradation . This is one reason to consider HPDE engineered plastic cooling towers from Delta Cooling Towers , which come with a 50 - year life expectancy and a 20 - year warranty . So , you do n't need to worry about replacements . Disinfection Risk : Because cooling towers are open to the environment , the system can rapidly become recolonized with microorganisms , like cooling tower legionella , even after chemicals or other agents were added to achieve sterilization . Prevention : Vary the antimicrobial stresses applied in the cooling tower microbial control program by alternating between two non-oxidizing biocides as a single dose or alternate an oxidizing antimicrobial with a non-oxidizing antimicrobial . Biofilms Risk : Dirt , dust , and other particles enter the cooling tower water during the cooling tower process . Depending on where the cooling tower is located , the amount of material can be extensive . The presence of biofilms is important for cooling tower legionella survival and growth - providing nutrients in water systems . Prevention : It is strongly advised to use a compatible and environmentally acceptable dispersant and \/ or detergent to penetrate biofilm and sediments . Make sure to follow proper cleaning and maintenance for your cooling tower system to ensure top performance and to minimize the risk of Legionnaires ' disease . Design & Material Used Risk : Areas of stagnant water prevent proper chemical treatment of the towers and allow legionella and their hosts to flourish . Prevention : Your cooling tower system should be designed for easy cleaning and maintenance to avoid buildup of sludge and deposits . While cooling tower conditions are often dependent on the water treatment chemicals being used , poor piping designs can create an environment where pathogens , like legionella , can thrive . On the plus side , Delta Cooling Towers ' antimicrobial technology is designed to minimize the risk of cooling tower legionella . Spray Drifts Risk : Even under normal operation , water droplets can leave the drift eliminator . Prevention : It is for this reason that cooling tower systems should never be installed next to air intakes or windows that may be opened . Also , every six months or so , inspect the conditions of the drift eliminators making sure there are no gaps to allow free flow of dirt . For best results , install the best drift eliminators available with drift rates as low as 0.0005 % of the circulating water flow . There are many innovative technologies available that can help prevent the growth of cooling tower legionella . One of the most effective is an anti-microbial cooling tower from Delta Cooling Towers . It contains an anti-microbial resin that 's compounded into the plastic material , so it will not fade or wash away . Furthermore , this product has the only lab-tested anti-microbial efficacy against legionella bacteria out of all the common cooling tower materials .

Harrison was at work in New York City testing his new waterproofing and damp-resistant materials to see if they would keep the air 's moisture out of homes and buildings . In 1904 , Arthur B. Harrison persuaded his employer at Clifford I. Miller Company , a plaster manufacturer , that a plant producing his materials could be a profitable venture . Mr. Miller agreed , though little realizing that someday Mr. Harrison 's enterprise would produce the Rolls - Royce of wood finishing products . In 1910 , Mr. Harrison purchased the Miller interests , and four years later he incorporated his business under the name Minwax\u00ae . Arthur B. Harrison manufactures his first line of waterproofing materials with the Clifford I. Miller Company . Arthur B. Harrison purchases business interests from his partner , Clifford I. Miller . Arthur B. Harrison Incorporates his business under the name of Minwax\u00ae . Minwax \u00ae develops a liquid , brush - on , paraffin formula to seal stone , which is later adapted for use on wood floors . Minwax \u00ae Wood Finish\u2122 formula is redesigned for homeowner use , becoming the first modern \" quick - drying \" product . Minwax \u00ae Wood Finish\u2122 is the leading brand of interior wood stains in the United States . By 1916 , the company had expanded and moved across the Hudson River to larger plant facilities in Clifton , NJ . Mr. Harrison was , by that time , the acknowledged expert in the field of waterproofing . In fact , membrane waterproofing , still in use today , was among his early innovations . In addition to general architectural and engineering projects , the Minwax Company was often asked to engineer waterproofing projects of significant historical importance . Cleopatra 's Needle , the Egyptian obelisk in Central Park , was thousands of years old when it arrived in New York . However , archaeologists soon realized the climatic change from the desert to North America was accelerating the deterioration of the monument . To help preserve it , the waterproofing techniques of the Minwax Company were called upon . At that point in time , stone structures were waterproofed by burning paraffin wax into the stone itself . Cleopatra 's Needle was too delicate for this . Burning paraffin would blacken the stone and destroy the hieroglyphic markings on it . To avoid this , Mr. Harrison developed a liquefied formula containing paraffin that would penetrate and seal the stone with a brush application . A wood scaffold was erected around the monument for the project . While brushing on the preparation , the workers noticed that drips and spills on the scaffolding beautified the wood . In fact , the scaffold looked like it had been treated to a paste wax finish , yet it was not slippery to walk on . The formula was refined and introduced to architects who began to specify it for wide use on floors and woodwork in public buildings and fine homes . In the late 1940s and early ' 50s , Minwax \u00ae moved into the consumer market . According to R. W. Harrison , Jr. , a grandson of Arthur B. Harrison who also served as President of Minwax \u00ae from 1962 - 1978 , this growth came with the realization we had a product the average person could use successfully . The product itself was redesigned and improved for homeowner use , and the wax in the finish was replaced by varnish gums , making the new Wood Finish \u2122 the first modern \" quick - drying \" product . Donald H. Henderson , a former President of Minwax\u00ae , recalled , \" Marketing of the new Wood Finish was originally a low - key activity , but word - of - mouth endorsement by satisfied customers generated enormous demand . \" Gradually , new colors were added to the line and new companion products were introduced to make Minwax \u00ae a complete Wood Finishing Products Company . Today , the power and beauty of wood is still important in both public buildings and private homes , and the Minwax Company provides consumers with a complete line of products to meet every wood finishing need . We look ahead excitedly as we continue our work to make and keep wood beautiful . Our future promises to be as exciting as our past ! <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Text\": [], \"Topic\": [], \"Time\": [\"In 1904\"], \"Speaker\": [\"Arthur B.

The average price of a 50kg bag of wheat flour was 1,100 Afghanis ( about US $ 21 ) on 10 March in Kabul , down from $ 36 in December 2008 . A 24.5kg sack of rice has gone down to $ 25 from $ 37 , and the cost of a 16kg canister of ghee is now $ 20 instead of $ 31 . \u201c Prices have fallen considerably compared to six months ago , \u201d Abdul Matin , a shopkeeper in Kabul 's main food market , told IRIN , citing food aid deliveries by aid agencies and the government , and imports from abroad as the main reasons for the fall in prices . Food prices , particularly for wheat flour , rose by up to 150 percent in 2008 because of drought , which left a domestic cereal production shortfall of about 35 percent . Export restrictions by Pakistan and other wheat exporting countries exacerbated the problem . Throughout 2008 spiralling food prices proved disastrous for millions of Afghans who were pushed into high - risk food insecurity . In a bid to provide a temporary safety net for about five million most vulnerable Afghans , UN agencies and the government launched a joint emergency appeal in April 2008 for over $ 404 million to procure and distribute 230,000 tonnes of food aid and provide other life - saving assistance . About 70 percent of the requested funds had been received from donors by February and food aid had reached some of the targeted population , the Ministry of Agriculture , Irrigation and Livestock ( MAIL ) said [ seen an IRIN report on winter wheat aid ] . Government action The government says it responded promptly to the price hikes in early 2008 by launching two joint emergency appeals , earmarked $ 100 million to procure wheat from regional markets , and waived taxes on food imports . \u201c Food items are adequately available in the country thanks to a number of measures taken by the government and also owing to donations from countries like India , China and Russia , \u201d Saddudin Safi , head of MAIL 's food security department , told IRIN . India has pledged 250,000 tonnes of wheat aid and Russia has reported the delivery of 18,000 tonnes of wheat flour to the country . \u201c We hope the importation of wheat from India will further decrease prices , \u201d said Safi , adding that negotiations were still under way on how to get the wheat through Pakistan . The Indian government has reportedly decided to lift its ban on wheat exports in May 2009 , a move expected to exert further downward pressure on food prices . Much will also depend on Afghanistan 's domestic agricultural production in 2009 . After an impressive harvest in 2007 , there was a shortfall of over two million tonnes of cereals in 2008 largely because of drought , according to MAIL . No respite for the poorest About 42 percent of the country 's estimated 27 million people live on less than $ 1 a day , according to the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) . A marginal reduction in food prices is good news for many but it will not ensure access to adequate food for about eight million Afghans , say experts . Households who live just above the poverty line could benefit most from falling food prices . Spending less on food will also help middle class families to save money for other essential needs such as healthcare and the education of their children . ad\/ at\/cb This article was produced by IRIN News while it was part of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs .

Chronology of terrorism against Americans , 1979 - 1988 <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> | | | The attacks , the groups , and the U.S. response | Nov. 4 , 1979 | Hostages taken at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran | | | Fifty - two American citizens were taken hostage when militant students of radical Islam stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran . [ 1 ] Shortly thereafter , U.S. President Jimmy Carter ordered a complete embargo of Iranian oil ; stronger economic embargoes followed . On April 8 , 1980 , Carter severed diplomatic relations with Iran after negotiations for the hostages ' release failed . Later that month , Carter authorized a top-secret mission , named Operation Eagle Claw , to free the hostages . Helicopters were to carry Delta Force commandos from a carrier in the Persian Gulf to a point outside Tehran , where they were to spend the night and begin the rescue the next morning . The complicated mission , which involved refueling the helicopters at a spot in the Iranian desert labeled \" Desert One , \" was aborted April 25 after three of the eight helicopters suffered mechanical failure . Eight U.S. servicemen were killed when one of the helicopters collided with a refueling plane . The hostages were finally released just hours after Ronald Reagan 's presidential inauguration on Jan. 20 , 1981 . They had spent 444 days in captivity . May 1981 | Threats from Libya | | | When intelligence reports surfaced that Libyan leader Muammar el - Qaddafi had plans to assassinate American diplomats in Rome and Paris , President Reagan expelled all Libyan diplomats from the U.S. ( May 6 , 1981 ) and closed Libya 's diplomatic mission in Washington , D.C. Three months later , Reagan ordered U.S. Navy jets to shoot down Libyan fighters if they ventured inside what was known as the \" line of death . \" ( This was the line created by Qaddafi to demarcate Libya 's territorial waters , which he said extended more than 100 miles off the country 's shoreline ; the U.S. and other maritime nations recognized Libyan territorial waters as extending only 12 miles from shore . ) As expected , the Libyan Air Force counter - attacked and Navy jets shot down two SU - 22 warplanes about 60 miles off the Libyan coast . Some alleged that the U.S. exaggerated the terrorist threat from Libya , in part because Libya was an easy target . The small country -- Libya is about one - fifth the physical size of the U.S. , and its entire population at that time was only 3 million or so -- was and still is considered a minor player in the Middle East with no steadfast allies . U.S. officials denied Libya was used as a scapegoat , maintaining that it posed a credible terrorist threat against U.S. targets and that Libya had sufficient oil funds to mount a significant attack on U.S. interests . April 18 , 1983 | Bombing of U.S. Embassy in Beirut | | | A suicide bomber in a pickup truck loaded with explosives rammed into the U.S. Embassy in Beirut , Lebanon . Sixty - three people were killed , including 17 Americans , eight of whom were employees of the Central Intelligence Agency , including chief Middle East analyst Robert C. Ames and station chief Kenneth Haas . Reagan administration officials said that the attack was carried out by Hezbollah operatives , a Lebanese militant Islamic group whose anti-U.S. sentiments were sparked in part by the revolution in Iran . The Hezbollah operatives who carried out the attack on the embassy reportedly were receiving financial and logistical support from both Iran and Syria . [ For more on how and why Iran and Syria were helping to direct attacks on the U.S. , see FRONTLINE 's interviews with Robert Oakley and Robert C. McFarlane . ] The U.S. government took no military action in response to the embassy bombing , although , according to retired Marine Lt. Col. Bill Cowan , a covert military team entered Beirut in order to gather intelligence in preparation for retaliatory strikes . Oct. 23 , 1983 | Bombing of Marine barracks in Beirut | | | A suicide bomber detonated a truck full of explosives at a U.S. Marine barracks located at Beirut International Airport ; 241 U.S. Marines were killed and more than 100 others wounded . They were part of a contingent of 1,800 Marines that had been sent to Lebanon as part of a multinational force to help separate the warring Lebanese factions . ( Twice during the early 1980s the U.S. had deployed troops to Lebanon to deal with the fall - out from the 1982 Israeli invasion . In the first deployment , Marines helped oversee the peaceful withdrawal of the PLO from Beirut . In mid-September 1982 -- after the U.S. troops had left -- Israel 's Lebanese allies massacred an estimated 800 unarmed Palestinian civilians remaining in refugee camps . Following this , 1,800 Marines had been ordered back into Lebanon . ) In his September 2001 FRONTLINE interview , Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger said the U.S. still lacks \" actual knowledge of who did the bombing \" of the Marine barracks . But it suspected Hezbollah , believed to be supported in part by Iran and Syria . Hezbollah denied its involvement . The president assembled his national security team to devise a plan of military action . The planned target was the Sheik Abdullah barracks in Baalbek , Lebanon , which housed Iranian Revolutionary Guards believed to be training Hezbollah fighters . Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger aborted the mission , reportedly because of his concerns that it would harm U.S. relations with other Arab nations . Instead , President Reagan ordered the battleship USS New Jersey , stationed off the coast of Lebanon , to the hills near Beirut . The move was seen as largely ineffective . Four months after the Marine barracks bombing , U.S. Marines were ordered to start pulling out of Lebanon . Dec. 12 , 1983 | Bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait | | | The American embassy in Kuwait was bombed in a series of attacks whose targets also included the French embassy , the control tower at the airport , the country 's main oil refinery , and a residential area for employees of the American corporation Raytheon . Six people were killed , including a suicide truck bomber , and more than 80 others were injured . The suspects were thought to be members of Al Dawa , or \" The Call , \" an Iranian - backed group and one of the principal Shiite groups operating against Saddam Hussein in Iraq . The U.S. military took no action in retaliation . In Kuwait , 17 people were arrested and convicted for participating in the attacks . One of those convicted was Mustafa Youssef Badreddin , a cousin and brother - in - law of one of Hezbollah 's senior officers , Imad Mughniyah . After a six - week trial in Kuwait , Badreddin was sentenced to death for his role in the bombings . Over the following years , the arrest and imprisonment of the \" Kuwait 17 \" ( also known as the \" Al Dawa 17 \" ) , became one of the most consistent demands of the kidnappers of Western hostages in Lebanon and plane hijackers . Ironically , when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 , the Iraqis unwittingly released the imprisoned Badreddin and the remaining members of the Kuwait 17 . Press reports vary about Badreddin 's current whereabouts . March 16 , 1984 | CIA Station Chief William Buckley kidnapped | | | Buckley was the fourth person to be kidnapped by militant Islamic extremists in Lebanon . The first American hostage , American University of Beirut President David Dodge , had been kidnapped in July 1982 . Eventually , 30 Westerners would be kidnapped during the 10- year- long Lebanese hostage - taking crisis ( 1982 - 1992 ) . Americans who were kidnapped included journalist Terry Anderson , American University of Beirut librarian Peter Kilburn , and Benjamin Weir , a Presbyterian minister . While some of the prisoners lived through captivity -- Anderson spent the longest time as a hostage , 2,454 days -- some , including Buckley , died in captivity or were killed by their kidnappers . U.S. officials believed that the Iranian - backed Hezbollah was behind most of the kidnappings and the Reagan administration devised a covert plan . Iran was desperately running out of military supplies in its war with Iraq , but Congress had banned the sale of American arms to countries like Iran that sponsored terrorism . Reagan was advised that a bargain could be struck -- secret arms sales to Iran , hostages back to the U.S. The plan , when it was revealed to the public , was decried as a failure and anathema to the U.S. policy of refusing to negotiate with terrorists . In August 1985 , the first consignment of arms to Iran was sent -- 100 anti-tank missiles provided by Israel ; another 408 were sent the following month . As a result of the deal , American hostage Benjamin Weir was released from captivity ; he had been imprisoned for 495 days . Only two other hostages were released as a result of the arms- for-hostages deal : in July 1986 , Martin Jenco , a Catholic priest , was released ; and the administrator of the American University of Beirut 's medical school , David Jacobson , was released in November 1986 . Since the funds from the arms sales to Iran were secretly , and illegally , funneled to the U.S. - backed Contras fighting to overthrow the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua , the infamous episode became known as the \" Iran - Contra affair . \" ( See the \" Final Report of the Independent Counsel for Iran \/ Contra Matters . ) Sept. 20 , 1984 | Bombing of U.S. Embassy annex northeast of Beirut | | | In Aukar , northeast of Beirut , a truck bomb exploded outside the U.S. Embassy annex killing 24 people , two of whom were U.S. military personnel . According to the U.S. State Department 's 1999 report on terrorist organizations , elements of Hezbollah are \" known or suspected to have been involved \" in the bombing . The U.S. mounted no military response to the embassy annex bombing , but it did begin to explore covert operations in Lebanon . Investigative journalist Bob Woodward says that the CIA trained foreign intelligence agents to act as \" hit teams \" designed to destroy the terrorists ' operations . Ambassador Robert Oakley says the U.S. merely attempted to set up a \" protective unit , \" a Lebanese counterterrorist strike force . President Reagan and the CIA called off covert operations when Lebanese intelligence operatives -- some allegedly trained by the U.S. -- set off a car bomb on March 8 , 1985 , in an attempted murder of Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah , the Shiite Muslim cleric who some believed to be the spiritual leader of Hezbollah . Over 80 people were killed in the attack near a Beirut mosque . Fadlallah survived . Many blamed the CIA for the attack , saying it had directed the intelligence operatives to carry it out . Robert McFarlane , President Reagan 's national security adviser , says that the operatives who carried out the attack on Fadlallah may have been trained by the U.S. , but the individuals who carried it out were \" rogue operative [ s ] , \" and the CIA in no way sanctioned or supported the attack .

Richard Corliss , Time , 8 September 2009 , South of the Border : Ch\u00e1vez and Stone 's Love Story <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> The rumor spread around the Lido like a Venezuelan oil fire : that the Venice Film Festival had paid for Oliver Stone 's trip to show his new documentary South of the Border but would n't cover the expenses of the film 's chief subject , Hugo Ch\u00e1vez . To some on the European ( and American ) Left , the President of Venezuela is a hero for his redistribution of wealth and truculent stance toward the U.S. under George W. Bush , whom he famously called the Devil . To others , his socialist agenda is tainted by human-rights violations and suppression of the opposition press . So if Ch\u00e1vez wanted to see the film at its world premiere , he 'd have to fly here on his own bol\u00edvar . The Sept. 8 evening public screening in the festival 's Sala Grande for which there was less visible security than for an inner-city high school began about 25 minutes late . The delay simply amped up the suspense : Would Ch\u00e1vez show ? He did , with Stone , both wearing dark jackets , white shirts and red ties . As is customary for the evening screenings , the festival 's female announcer slowly read off the names of a half - dozen members of the movie 's production team , standing in front of their seats in the front mezzanine . Polite applause for each . She got to Stone : hearty cheers for the writer -director of Platoon , Born on the Fourth of July and JFK . Then the announcer stopped . Ch\u00e1vez would not be officially introduced to the audience . So the director grabbed the President 's hand and raised it above their heads in a victory grip . No boos or rude cries greeted the gesture . Only : Ovation ! Ol\u00e9 ! ( See TIME 's top 100 movies . ) The 70 - minute movie which was co-written by the British - Pakistani commentator Tariq Ali , author of the 2006 study Pirates of the Caribbean : Axis of Hope , and photographed in part by docu-doyen Albert Maysles is amateur night as cinema , as lopsided and cheerleadery as its worldview . U.S. foreign policy , Stone asserts , divides South American nations into \" friends , whose leaders do what we tell them to do , and enemies , whose leaders occasionally disagree with us . \" His film is no more nuanced . He sees the geopolitical glass as all empty ( the U.S. and its world - banking arm , the International Monetary Fund ) or all full ( Ch\u00e1vez and his comrade Presidentes in South America ) . But there 's an undeniable fascination in the project , even some inspirational value , in Stone 's conversations with a half - dozen leaders of nations struggling to emerge from under the shadow or boot of the U.S. ( Read Mary Corliss ' review of Michael Moore 's new movie Capitalism : A Love Story . ) Stone extends his rigorous dichotomy to the film 's structure . The first half focuses on Ch\u00e1vez , the second on other South American heads of state who tilt to the port side : Brazil 's Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva , Paraguay 's Fernando Lugo , Ecuador 's Rafael Correa , Argentina 's Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner , Bolivia 's Evo Morales and the grand old man of social revolution , Ra\u00fal Castro . ( Stone profiled Ra\u00fal 's brother in a similarly indulgent 2003 poli-doc , Commandante . ) The only missing socialist leader is Daniel Ortega , President of Nicaragua a regime whose electoral council outlawed the two main opposition groups from participating in the 2008 election and barred outside observers from monitoring the vote , which was widely criticized as rigged . The film 's first section briefly synopsizes Ch\u00e1vez 's life from his mud - hut birth in Sabaneta to his rise through the Venezuelan military , to his abortive coup attempt in 1992 and his election seven years later to lead the world 's third - largest oil provider increasing the standard of living for many of his country 's poor while denying many rights to those , especially in the media , who would oppose him . In the movie 's rose - colored lens , the President comes across as an outsize personality , equal parts machismo and charisma . He sounds more sensible than menacing when he says of his government , \" This is a revolution , peaceful but armed . \" Standing near a corn-processing factory , he jokes , \" This is where we build the Iranian atomic bomb . A corn bomb . \" Every step of the way , Stone is by , and on , on the President 's side . He raises no tough issues , some of which are summarized in Amnesty International 's 2009 report on Venezuela : \" Attacks on journalists were widespread . Human-rights defenders continued to suffer harassment . Prison conditions provoked hunger strikes in facilities across the country . \" Referring to the 2006 election in which Ch\u00e1vez won a third term , Stone tells viewers that \" 90 % of the media was opposed to him , \" and yet he prevailed . \" There is a lesson to be learned , \" Stone says . Yes : support the man in power , or your newspaper , radio station or TV network may be in jeopardy . The movie 's second half has more appeal to a general audience , perhaps because most of the other Presidents are less famous or notorious than Ch\u00e1vez , perhaps because the first half has conditioned us to a rigorously genial treatment of them . Lula da Silva brags that Brazil paid off the IMF debt and that the country now has a $ 260 billion surplus . ( Irmao , can you spare us a dime ? ) Morales , the first indigenous President of Bolivia , says he considers himself \" less a President than a union leader . \" The Illinois-educated Correa says smilingly that the U.S. can again have a military base in Ecuador \" if Ecuador can have a military base in Miami . \" Ra\u00fal Castro , survivor of a half - century of American disapproval , toasts his younger compadres : \" Now we 're ready for another 50 years . \" As big an international celebrity as any of his subjects , Stone is ever willing to interrupt an interview for some schmoozing or fun . He kicks a football around with Ch\u00e1vez , shares coca leaves with Morales , quizzes Kirchner on how many pairs of shoes she owns . ( A little annoyed at the implicit comparison to Imelda Marcos , Kirchner replies , \" If I were a man , would you ask me how many pairs of pants I own ? \" ) Accompanying Ch\u00e1vez to the mud hut where he was born , Stone directs the President in a scene : ride around the yard on the bicycle you had as a kid . Ch\u00e1vez mounts the tiny bike and takes a few pedals . Instantly it breaks from his weight , and Ch\u00e1vez dissolves in laughter . South of the Border is a near sibling to the Michael Moore docu - comedy Capitalism : A Love Story , which premiered at Venice last night and which looks like a masterpiece of attitudinal moviemaking next to Stone 's slapdash effort . Moore appears in a news clip from 2007 , lecturing Wolf Blitzer on what the filmmaker saw as CNN 's gutless coverage of the U.S. Iraq invasion . Moore and Stone share the notions that capitalism can be predatory and that priests , in the U.S. and Paraguay ( where the President is a former Catholic bishop ) , are all liberation theologians . And in both films , Barack Obama 's election is heralded as triggering an era of enlightenment . \" I hope he will be a new Roosevelt , \" Ch\u00e1vez says at the end of the film , \" and I hope he starts a new New Deal . \" As the final credits rolled and the house lights came up , the director and his star received the crowd 's vocal warmth . Ch\u00e1vez went to the bleachers to greet a few people , then descended the steps to the orchestra area . Someone asked him a question , and he spoke for five minutes or more in Spanish , in a conversational voice that not many could hear . Stone , slightly behind , seemed to wonder , Hey , whose movie is this ? and joined Ch\u00e1vez as he shouted , \" Viva Oliver ! \" He made it sound almost like \" Bol\u00edvar ! \" A small retinue of guards led them down the steps to the lobby , and on the way out , Ch\u00e1vez smiled and shook a few more hands . Quite a powerful grip , Mary Corliss told me . But then , he is Venezuela 's strongman .

A judge has ordered eight schools with the Hanover School Division in Manitoba to compile and catalogue copies of their handouts and lesson plans from 2013 onward , the Hanover Teachers ' Association says . \" For a lot of teachers , it could be a logistical nightmare , \" said Wendell Head , the association 's president . \" A lot of times we change courses , grades , sometimes we throw the materials out , sometimes they 're in a box in the garage . \u2026 Now you have to go digging for that . \" For some teachers , it will be a lot of work , and the end of the year is a particularly busy time in schools , he said . Many teachers have been working extra hours to get the items compiled and catalogued , while the school division has provided substitute teachers and information technology support to help with uploading the documents , Head said . River East Transcona School Division confirmed it has schools that are part of the court order , while the head of the Pembina Trails Teachers ' Association said eight of that division 's schools have also been ordered to comply . Winnipeg School Division , the province 's largest , said it is not affected . There are likely more Manitoba schools , but the Department of Education would not provide a list of the affected divisions . \" School divisions across Canada \u2026 have been selected at random to determine how they use copyrighted material . Neither the Hanover School Division , nor other school divisions , are being sued through this litigation , and they are providing information requested by the court , \" a spokesperson for Manitoba Education wrote . Legal spat related to fair dealing The legal spat is between Access Copyright \u2014 which represents and collects royalties for tens of thousands of Canadian writers , artists and publishers \u2014 and the Education departments for all provinces and territories , excluding B.C. and Quebec . The lawsuit , which has been ongoing since February 2018 , started when Education departments across Canada claimed the kindergarten to Grade 12 school system was paying too much in fees to copy published material , suing Access Copyright for $ 25 million . Access Copyright then counter - sued for $ 50 million , arguing that Canadian schools make more than 150 million photocopies of copyrighted material each year that require payment . In 2012 , Canada changed the rules surrounding the educational use of copyrighted materials . The law established \" fair dealing \" for school use . A further Supreme Court decision ruled that teachers in Canada can make copies of certain materials for classes without paying royalties . But those changes had a detrimental effect on the Canadian publishing industry , said Kirsten Phillips , president of the Association of Manitoba Book Publishers . Phillips also works for Portage & Main Press , a Winnipeg - based publishing house that produces reading and textbook materials for children and schools . Several Manitoba publishers have experienced a drop in copyright revenues from 75 to 90 per cent and are also seeing a decrease in sales of books , she said . Phillips said in one case , a Manitoba publisher received an order for one single copy of a textbook for an entire school . While she feels for teachers , Phillips said the court order is necessary to give a clearer picture of how published work is being copied . \" This is a way of showing that yes , these teachers do use these materials . And we do need to pay the proper creator for the work that they 're using in their classroom . \" CBC News requested interviews with Manitoba 's education minister and the Council of Ministers of Education , Canada , but interviews were n't granted . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Supplier\": [\"Teachers at 300 Canadian schools\"], \"Recipient\": [\"Access Copyright\"], \"Place\": [\"Canada\"], \"Theme\": [\"copies of their handouts and lesson plans from 2013 onward\"], \"Time\": [\"the end of the year\"], \"Imposed_purpose\": [\"to determine how they use copyrighted material\"]}"}

Founder Brent Oxley was adamant about being able to <event> back up <\/event> an \" unlimited \" option prior to offering service named as such and increased staffing . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> \u201c Unlimited Hosting \u201d refers to web hosting offers that come with unlimited disk storage , data transfer and in some cases , unlimited addon domain ( websites ) . While technically it 's impossible for any company to host \u201c unlimited \u201d websites ( more about this later ) , no-limit hosting plans are very popular \u2013 mainly because it reduces the cost of hosting multiple sites significantly . With A2 Hosting you get a choice of either hosting one or multiple websites in three unlimited hosting plans \u2013 Drive , Turbo Boost , and Turbo Max . A2's Turbo plans step up the game a little bit and open access to their Turbo option which lays claim to perform up to 20x faster . All A2 Hosting plans include a bunch of freebies ranging from easy site migration and free SSL setup to some other free applications that are quite useful such as A2 Optimized plugin for Word Press and Presta Shop . Pros : Cons : Green Geeks offers more than just unlimited storage and bandwidth , but also Bonneville Environmental Foundation ( BEF ) certified green hosting . They are very affordable \u2013 Lite plan signup at just $ 2.49 \/ mo and performed well in our server speed test . Pros : Cons : TMDHosting is not perfect but I do recommend their unlimited hosting for bloggers or business in need of a reliable web hosting solution . Not only do they offer stable server performances and tons of useful features , but they also have some of the best customer support team in the industry . TMD 's cheapest unlimited hosting plan comes with Weebly Sitebuilder and starts at $ 2.95 \/ mo. Pros : Cons : If I were not to have the utmost faith in InMotion hosting , I would not be forking out hundreds of dollars each year in hosting fees . I believe that two key elements make them one of the top hosts I 've encountered to date ; Exceptional server performance and fantastic customer service . In Motion unlimited hosting comes in four flavors \u2013 Lite , Launch , Power , and Pro with all four plans give \u201c unlimited \u201d data transfer capacity . In Motion Lite only allows 1 website per account , while Launch , Power and Pro allow up to 2 , 50 and 100 websites per account . Pros : Cons : Bluehost is an excellent choice in hosting partners for so many reasons . This US - based web host is one of the top performers we know . In addition , they 're one of only three WordPress -recommended hosting services in the world . They offer unlimited hosting with their Bluehost Plus plan . That applies to SSD storage space and the number of websites you can run with a single plan . Also included are a free domain name , SSL , and CDN . Pros : Cons : Take BlueHost as example \u2013 the company BlueHost offers full range hosting services \u2013 from shared hosting to VPS and dedicated hosting . If you opt for BlueHost Shared Hosting Plus Plan , you get to host * unlimited * websites at the price of $ 5.45 per month . On the other hand , you will have to pay at least $ 79.99 per month on BlueHost Standard Dedicated Plan , which comes with * limited * 500 GB storage , 4 GB RAM , and 5 TB bandwidth . The math does n't work right , is n't ? Why would someone pay $ 79.99 a month for a hosting plan with limited bandwidth when the same provider is offering an unlimited plan at just $ 5.45 a month ? Truth is , hosting companies are in a world of their own , especially in terminology . To the average layman , ' unlimited ' means exactly that \u2013 without limitations . However , that 's not quite so true when it comes to unlimited hosting plans . Trust is \u2026 there is always a limit . Wake up and smell the roses , people . We live in a finite world . \u201c Unlimited \u201d is nothing but an imaginary industrial term , liberally sprinkled with caveats ( also known as exceptions ) . Web hosting is a very competitive business . Web hosting companies are doing all they can , including giving out free migration services and free Google Adwords credits , to win new customers . Because \u201c more if often better \u201d in consumers ' beliefs , \u201c unlimited hosting plans \u201d became a popular marketing tactics in mid 2000 's ( and , if I recall this correctly , BlueHost was the very first that started this ) . So now you have the \u201c why \u201d \u2013 it 's time to tackle the \u201c how \u201d . If you 've gone through the ToS of a site that 's promising you the moon and the stars for the rock bottom price of $ 2 \/ mo and think you might finally be putting one over the web hosting provider , think again . Let 's consider the phenomena known as overselling . Overselling happens when a hosting company sells more than they have the actual capacity to provide . Large hosting companies normally own incomprehensible amounts of hosting capacity ( bandwidth pipes , computer servers , manpower \u2026 etc ) that would never be exceeded by a single website . At the same time , most websites need only very few resources to run daily , such as the average corporate website . Seeing that most resources in their servers remain unused , the hosting companies ( that offer unlimited hosting ) therefore have the ability to just re-sell those unused hosting capacities ( aka overselling ) . Now , jumping back to our topic \u2013 how unlimited web hosting works . Consider reading an ad for a new all - you - can - eat buffet place and heading over there to try it . Once you get there , there is a note saying you have to weigh less than 70kg ( 154lbs ) before you can enter . That 's the catch . The same applies to many unlimited hosting plans \u2013 you are welcomed to host unlimited websites and take up unlimited hosting storage and bandwidth as long X or Y conditions are met . The problem is that these conditions are rarely stated in the marketing area of the web hosting site . That part of the site keeps telling you that you 're getting an unlimited plan . In small print , usually under the Terms of Service ( ToS ) , there will likely be a million and one limitations and house rules . For instance : You can get more details of these limitations in my BlueHost , Hostinger , and i Page review . Every single unlimited hosting provider out there will have its own house rules and server limitations to control their users . These limitations could be in terms of CPU queries , RAM , inodes , number of MySQL databases , number of MySQL database connections , or even FTP uploads \u2013 the list goes on . As soon as your websites hit the red zone ; the hosting company will pull the plug on your account , or impose additional charges on you ( and boy will they CHARGE ! ) . That is how \u201c unlimited hosting \u201d works . You can argue that overselling and unlimited hosting plans are somewhat unethical . However , it does not indicate that the said hosting company is outright evil . For one , the practice of overselling is the main reason why we can have super cheap hosting services in the market these days . Also , going \u201c unlimited \u201d is never an easy business decision for hosting providers . Take Hostgator back in 2000 's for example , the company spent more than a year to prepare ( including hiring new employee and investing in supporting hardware ) for the launching of unlimited hosting . Although they are now offering unlimited hosting service , their servers remained reliable and efficient ; and the customer support is never lacking in quality . Brent Oxley , Hostgator founder , said this when Hostgator started offering unlimited hosting : I wanted to call the plans unlimited last time around . However , due to staffing constraints , we would n't have been able to keep up with the expected growth . A year later , we are finally OVERSTAFFED and ready to change the plan . Up until now , I 've been slowing sales down on purpose in order for our support to catch up . If history repeats itself , renaming the plan from essentially unlimited to actually \u201c unlimited \u201d will increase our sales by at least 30 % . \u201d In the last year , we have been spending more money on recruiting employees than we have on advertising ! It has taken us years of hiring and training to get us to the point where we are now . We 've gone from begging employees to work overtime to asking who wants to go home . Host Gator will always have the occasional scheduling gap , but for now , we 're sending over a dozen employees home a day . \u2013 Brent Oxley , Ex-Hostgator Founder & CEO The truth is , the quality of a hosting deal relies on a number of factors . Nowadays , the last things we need to compare are basic features like data transfer and disk storage . Technology has evolved so much that much of these factors are now dirt cheap and almost every shared hosting company is giving this same unlimited features to users these days . How do we compare between GreenGeeks and A2 Hosting 's unlimited hosting plans ? They look all the same from outside : unlimited bandwidth , unlimited storage , unlimited databases , unlimited addon domain , price below $ 10 \/ mo , and so on . Hosting performance , such as uptime and speed ; as well as special - built features are the answers . To get an unlimited web host you can trust on , try : Before we publish a host review , we signup to a web host and use uptime and speed tracking tools to gauge their service quality . Here are some uptime data ( tracked using Uptime Robot and our in - house built HostScore ) we published in the past : And here are some speed test results ( using Bitcatcha and our in - house built HostScore ) we published in our reviews . Unlimited hosting providers usually apply limitations on usage of their server resources \u2013 such as CPU run time , concurrent database connections , and inodes . There are several things you can do to overcome these limitations and protect yourself , including : So , are we clear on the topic unlimited hosting ? A quick recap on what you have just read : \u201c Unlimited Hosting \u201d refers to web hosting offers that come with unlimited disk storage , data transfer and in some cases , unlimited addon domain . We live in a finite world . Therefore \u201c Unlimited \u201d hosting is not possible . Web hosting is a very competitive business . Web hosting companies are doing all they can , including giving out free migration services and free Google Adwords credits , to win new customers . Because \u201c more if often better \u201d in consumers ' beliefs , \u201c unlimited hosting plans \u201d became a popular marketing tactics in mid 2000 's ( and , if I recall this correctly , BlueHost was the very first that started this ) .

Unlimited shared hosting plan usually costs between $ 3 \u2013 $ 7 per month during signup . Yes . The quality of a hosting service relies on a number of factors \u2013 basic features like data transfer and storage capacity are not as critical as they used to be . , the last things we need to compare are basic features like data transfer and disk storage . Technology has evolved so much that storage and network bandwidth are now dirt cheap and almost every shared hosting company is giving this same unlimited to users these days .

Biography John Eyles , a Wiltshire mercer and wool stapler , had two sons , John and Francis , who made their fortunes as London merchants ; became aldermen and , in John 's case , lord mayor of London and M.P. Devizes 1679 - 81 ; and ended with a knighthood and a baronetcy respectively . Francis 's eldest son , John , was a leading figure in the city of London when he was returned as a Whig in 1713 for Chippenham , not far from the Eyles estates in Wiltshire . Voting regularly with the Government after George I 's accession , he was elected by the Commons to be a commissioner for the sale of the estates forfeited by English Jacobites in the 1715 rebellion . In 1721 he was called in to salvage the South Sea Company , over whose affairs he presided as sub-governor for the next 12 years , speaking frequently on the Company 's behalf in Parliament . On the third reading of the bill to regulate elections for London , 19 Mar. 1725 , Eyles successfully proposed an amendment to alter the qualification for householders from 20s. to 30s. , although the House had already debated and agreed to 20s . in committee . A year later , on a petition from Richard Hampden to compound for his debts as treasurer of the navy , Eyles asserted that Hampden so far from being a great loser in the South Sea bubble had actually gained \u00a3 9,000 , as appeared from the Company 's books . 1 At the general election of 1727 Eyles was returned at the head of the poll for the city of London , where he was ' the great support of the ministry interest ' . 2 In 1732 he incurred a reprimand from the House of Commons for having authorized the secretary to the forfeited estates commission to sign for him in his absence , thus making possible the fraudulent sale of the Derwentwater estates ( see Bond , Denis ) . In a public apology he wrote : If the great weight of business which the disordered affairs of the South Sea Company laid upon him within that remarkable period of time be not forgot , he can not but hope to find a generous apology from the breast of everyone before whom he is now in judgment . 3 In the same session he was attacked by Edward Vernon , who insinuated that the directors of the Company had carried on a private trade , contrary to their oaths and hurtful to the company ... having his eye all the time on Sir John Eyles ( who by the universal vogue has been greatly guilty in this respect ) . Sir John , in his reply , took this as a charge levelled at himself , and said that gentleman had accused him in the House of what he dared not say to him out of it . Upon this several gentlemen interposed , and required the Speaker to enjoin both of them to give their words that nothing should ensue ; accordingly they both declared they would not prosecute their resentment . 4 Next January , presiding as sub-governor over a general meeting of the South Sea Company , he announced ' in a pathetic speech ' that he thanked the Company for the honours they had done him in choosing him four times successively into that post ; that his close application to the Company 's affairs had impaired his health to that degree as to determine him not to stand candidate at the next election for the station he was in ; and therefore desired them to think of another . 5 Voting against the excise bill in 1733 , he did not stand for London in 1734 and was defeated at Chippenham . He became father of the city in 1737 , but ' seldom or never ' attended a corporation meeting . 6 Made joint postmaster general in 1739 , he died 11 Mar. 1745 . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Recipient\": [], \"Place\": [], \"Theme\": [\"estates\"], \"Surrenderer\": [\"by English Jacobites\"], \"Time\": [\"1715\"]}"}

Chong alleges that 8,000 to 10,000 copies of his yet - to - be released documentary , which he claims were seized by the authorities , were the actual focal point of the raid . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Five years after taking the lead in \" Operation Pipe Dreams , \" which prosecuted people who sold marijuana pipes around the country , U.S. Attorney Mary Beth Buchanan is leading a similar investigation called \" Operation True Test . \" The newest project for Ms. Buchanan is looking into companies that sell \" masking products \" that are supposed to help drug-users pass employer drug tests . Opponents of the products contend that they can put the public at risk if a person like an airline pilot were to use them to hide drugs in his system . The products are regulated on a state - by - state basis ; there is no federal law covering them . But critics , including comedian Tommy Chong , whom Ms. Buchanan prosecuted as part of Operation Pipe Dreams , say this is just another example of a frivolous prosecution and misplaced priorities . \" The terrorists crash into her area , and she 's concentrating on porn and bongs , \" Mr. Chong said , referring to the Sept. 11 , 2001 , crash of United Flight 93 in Somerset County . \" That kind of tells you the direction she 's headed . \" Search warrants for Operation True Test were served Wednesday at nine locations in six states -- though none in Ms. Buchanan 's Western District of Pennsylvania . \" We have no idea what the connection to Pittsburgh is , \" said Jennifer Kinsley , the attorney for Spectrum Labs , whose Newport , Ky. , offices were searched . Another target was the business in Signal Hill , Calif . , that makes The Whizzinator , a prosthetic penis in which clean urine is stored to be used to beat drug tests monitored by an observer . Spectrum Labs makes a number of masking products , including one known as Urine Luck , a liquid that is added to urine to purify it . Only a small amount of product was seized during the search Wednesday , Ms. Kinsley said . The main items taken were documents -- including bank records , business documents and order forms . Also seized , Mr. Chong said , were 8,000 to 10,000 copies of the recently released documentary \" a\/ k \/ a Tommy Chong , \" a film chronicling his journey through arrest , prosecution and nine-month prison term . Attorneys for Spectrum Labs have said no copies of the documentary were seized . \" It 's a way to punish the distributor financially , \" Mr. Chong said . \" There 's no way to get the DVDs back until the investigation is over . \" Mr. Chong said he has no ownership in the film . He called the documentary a \" focal point \" of the raid . It was released about a month ago , and sales were slow , Mr. Chong said . \" It 's selling like crazy now , thanks to Mary Beth . She 's brought us a nice publicity gimmick . \" Ms. Buchanan would not comment on Mr. Chong 's allegation or discuss what alleged crimes are being investigated as part of Operation True Test . She also turned down an invitation to appear on Fox News Channel 's \" Geraldo At Large \" last night with Mr. Chong . Laws regulating masking products vary from state to state . In Kentucky , the law refers to masks for alcohol and controlled substances , Ms. Kinsley said , while her client 's Web site says it targets nicotine use . In Pennsylvania , it 's a third - degree misdemeanor to sell or use drug -free urine to try to pass a drug test . A New York congressman tried to pass a federal law dealing with the issue with the Drug Testing Integrity Act of 2005 . But it never got off the ground . Some have said that such products fall under federal drug paraphernalia laws , but Ms. Kinsley strongly disagrees . Under the U.S. Criminal Code , drug paraphernalia are defined as \" any equipment , product , or material of any kind which is primarily intended or designed for use in manufacturing , compounding , converting , concealing , producing , processing , preparing , injecting , ingesting , inhaling or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance . \" Ms. Kinsley does not believe that definition applies to her client 's products , and she thinks that Congress agrees with her -- otherwise there would n't have been a movement to create a new law to address masking products . Lawyer Stanton D. Levenson , who represents Mr. Chong and the company that makes The Whizzinator , said he also has heard the government is trying to make a paraphernalia case , \" which just blows my mind . \" We 're ready to do battle with them , \" he said . \" There 's no way this is a paraphernalia case . \" The maker of The Whizzinator learned there was an investigation going on as far back as October 2006 when its network provider was served a subpoena . Mr. Levenson is a strong critic of the Pipe Dreams prosecutions , calling them \" stupid , \" and a waste of money . But he called the current investigation involving The Whizzinator more serious . \" It would appear there 's a potentially more legitimate purpose to this type of prosecution than the head - shop one , \" Mr. Levenson said . \" There could potentially be some public benefit to this . \" We do n't want school bus drivers and airline pilots who have drug problems beating the test and driving intoxicated . \" Laura Shelton , the executive director of the Drug and Alcohol Testing Industry Association , agrees . That 's why her organization has been lobbying for a national law for several years . The problem with sporadic , individual state enforcement , she said , is that the company that makes the masking agents can just move across state lines . The Government Accountability Office did a study on this issue in 2005 , and an update is expected next week . Ms. Shelton hopes with the renewed focus on masking products that a federal ban might get some traction . Current federal law requires mandatory drug testing for a number of professions , including truck drivers , airline pilots and railroad engineers . However , the law does not require labs to screen for adulterants that are used to mask the results . \" The majority of them are detectable , but the labs just are n't testing for them , \" Ms. Shelton said . \" Unfortunately , on some of these issues , it takes a crisis to get something going . \" Ms. Kinsley , the lawyer for Spectrum Labs , is already familiar with Ms. Buchanan from another of her cases -- the prosecution of Extreme Associates , a film production company in California that makes violent , graphic films . The owners of the company are charged with 10 counts of violating federal obscenity laws by transporting obscene materials through the U.S. mail and over the Internet . Ms. Kinsley is on the team of lawyers representing Extreme Associates . That case is still not scheduled to go to trial . When Ms. Kinsley learned that Ms. Buchanan was leading the masking products investigation , she was n't surprised . \" I laughed , \" she said . \" Here we go again . \" She wonders how prosecutors will make the new case into a federal crime . With Extreme Associates , federal investigators posed as customers and ordered the graphic pornography online and had it mailed to them in Pittsburgh . The search of the Extreme Associates offices was conducted in April 2003 , and the indictment was handed up four months later . Because of the volume of documents taken , Ms. Kinsley expects a much longer lag time if charges are filed in the Spectrum Labs case . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Agent\": [], \"Place\": [\"Newport , Ky.\"], \"Source\": [\"Spectrum Labs\"], \"Time\": [\"Wednesday\"], \"Theme\": [\"8,000 to 10,000 copies of the recently released documentary \\\" a\/ k \/ a Tommy Chong , \\\"\"]}"}

Popular with the KKK and neo-Nazi groups , the site included forums where users sometimes promoted white power events . \" I 'm talking to my lawyers , and that 's about all I can do right now , \" Black said . \" I can switch to another domain , but it might wind up the same way . \" Another major white supremacist website , The Daily Stormer , was previously shut down by the web-hosting company Go Daddy and then Google after the violence in Charlottesville . The Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law said the stormfront.org shutdown followed complaints it filed with Network Solutions alleging the site promotes not only hate speech , but deadly violence . A spokesman for Network Solutions did not immediately return an email seeking comment . Users of Black 's website have been implicated in more than 100 killings , according to the complaint , including 77 people slain by neo-Nazi Anders Breivik at a camp in Norway in 2011 . \" Especially in the wake of tragic events in Charlottesville and the spike in hate crimes across the country , Stormfront crossed the line of permissible speech and incited and promoted violence , \" said Kristen Clarke , executive director of the Lawyers ' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law . Black , speaking about the shutdown during an online radio show on Monday , said his site had rules against promoting violence or any crime . Black was a state KKK leader under former Klan Imperial Wizard David Duke , who appeared on the radio show following Black and expressed his \" full support \" for Black and the website . \" He was the first major site defending the rights of white people , \" said Duke . Black has been involved in the white supremacy movement since the 1970s and was convicted in 1981 for his role in a right - wing plot to overthrow the government of Caribbean island nation of Dominica . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Addressee\": [], \"Speaker\": [\"Stormfront\"], \"Place\": [\"online\"], \"Content\": [\"not only hate speech , but deadly violence\"]}"}

The award - winning songwriter , who has penned hits for Tim McGraw , Neal McCoy and Colin Raye , will be in town this week to write some songs with Park City School District students for his Kids Write Songs project . Seskin , who is in town for the upcoming Park City Songwriters Festival , will hold songwriting sessions for students this week at Jeremy Ranch , Parley 's Park , Trailside elementary schools and Ecker Hill Middle School . But what Seskin is really jazzed for is the free concert he and the kids will perform at 7 p.m. on Friday , Sept. 13 , at the Eccles Center for the Performing Arts . \u201c The concert will include kids from all four schools singing the songs they created with me , as well as me singing some of my own songs , \u201d Seskin said . \u201c I 'm really looking forward to it . \u201d The songs will address issues of bullying , being respectful students and being a good force in the community , which is the core of Kids Write Songs , he said . Kids Write Songs was born out of a program called Operation Respect , an anti-bullying nonprofit founded by Peter Yarrow of the folk trio Peter , Paul and Mary . \u201c I had written a song in 1999 called ' Do n't Laugh at Me , ' and Peter , Paul and Mary recorded it , \u201d Seskin said . \u201c Peter turned the theme of that song into an anti-bullying school curriculum . \u201d Throughout the years , Seskin participated in Operation Respect school assemblies , where he would visit with students and sing about respect . \u201c Thirteen years ago , I thought it might be good to get the kids to use their own words to write songs about these issues , so I started Kids Write Songs , which was meant to address those issues in songs created by the kids themselves , \u201d Seskin said . The goal was not only to teach the kids about kindness but also to inspire them to be creative . \u201c I teach them about song construction , \u201d Seskin said . \u201c I show them how songs are like stories that have a beginning , a middle and an end . \u201d During those workshops , Seskin examines the different sections of a song . \u201c We usually start with a chorus , which is the main point of the song , \u201d he said . \u201c It sums up the song , and it 's where the title is almost always is . \u201d From there , Seskin teaches the students about verses . \u201c What 's great for me is to see who the kids start to shine when they start writing the verses , because the stories about what the kids have observed and lived through are interesting , \u201d he said . Songwriting , Seskin says , is more effective than just taking with kids . \u201c Usually if you just ask them directly what they feel about something , they might tell you , and they might not , \u201d he said . \u201c But if you ask them to write a song , there is more of a chance they will fully convey their thoughts . \u201d There 's nothing like seeing young students putting their energies into something that will help them to creatively speak their minds , Seskin said . \u201c Kid think about a lot of things ; more than we give them credit for , \u201d he said . \u201c So this gives them a forum to write about those feelings . And that 's when their own stories will start coming out of the woodwork . \u201d The other goal of getting students to write and perform their own songs is to inspire their classmates . \u201c It 's to spread good messages to kids through kids , \u201d he said . \u201c If we do our job right , the songs the kids will write will touch something in the other kids that will motivate them to be better people . \u201d Support Local Journalism Support Local Journalism Readers around Park City and Summit County make the Park Record 's work possible .

Johnna Wright almost chose tent No. 7 in the camp 's Kiowa unit . But Wright , now 18 , testified here Wednesday that she decided to go to another tent . \" I just did n't like the location , \" she said . \" There were a lot of woods around it . I just did n't like it . \" Sometime in the darkness of that night or the next morning , the three girls who chose tent No. 7 were raped and murdered . The parents of victims Denise Milner and Lori Farmer have filed a $ 5 million wrongful - death lawsuit here against the Tulsa - based Magic Empire Girl Scout Council , which operated the camp in Mayes County near Locust Grove . Also named in the lawsuit is the Hartford Insurance Company , which carried a policy on the camp . Attorneys for Walter and Bettye Milner and Charles and Sherri Farmer claim that the camp was overgrown , unlit , unsecured and poorly operated . The council 's alleged negligence allowed the girls ' deaths , the lawsuit contends . A string of witnesses testified Wednesday , the trial 's third day , about numerous thefts , burglaries and intrusions at the camp over the years . Several former counselors and campers testified Wednesday that Scouting officials never told them what to do if intruders entered the camp . Attorneys Jack Gaither and Ben Faulkner claim that Scouting officials showed an \" unbelievable lack of caution and alertness , \" despite numerous incidents which should have prompted them to improve camp security . Former head counselor Constance Cunningham testified that in a 1971 summer session she huddled , gun in hand , inside a tent which four teen - age Scouts said had been entered the night before by a strange man . Cunningham said the vigil culminated two years of frightening intrusions . During her two years as counselor , she said , campers ' and counselors ' tents were ransacked on several occasions . During both years , campers and counselors spotted intruders at night inside the 410 - acre camp , she said . The former counselor said she talked to camp director Helen \" Smitty \" Gray in 1970 , after campers came to her and told her they were hearing heavy breathing outside their tents at night . \" She brushed it off and said we 've had several things going on in summers past , \" Cunningham testified . She said that the next year , as the Camp Scott staff prepared for summer sessions , Gray called a meeting with the counselors who knew about the previous year 's incidents . \" She cautioned us not to say a thing of what had gone on the summer before to the counselors that were new . She did n't want them upset , \" Cunningham said . She said Gray insisted on secrecy . Later that summer , a disturbing series of incidents began at the Kiowa unit , Cunningham said . \" One of the counselors was reporting that she heard a male person calling , \" Help me . Help me . Please help me . I 'm hurt , \" ' she said . Shortly afterwards , someone began ransacking tents , she said . Again , she said , counselors voiced their concerns to Gray . \" She said , \" it 's nothing , \" ' Cunningham testified . \" In fact , she said she was n't sure that some of the counselors who had worked the summer before had n't told the other people , and that someone was n't playing a big joke . As the intrusions continued , Cunningham said , she grew more frightened . \" They were just pushing it aside as nothing important . I was told that it had gone on in summers past , that no harm had been done , just do n't worry about it . \" Finally , she said , a counselor who had a permit to carry a gun gave her the gun and showed her how to handle it . Dan Rogers , attorney for the Magic Empire Council , attacked Cunningham 's testimony about the gun . \" Do n't you know that 's so much against the rules that it 's unbelievable ? \" Rogers asked . \" Sir , I do n't know what the rules or regulations are , \" Cunningham replied . Gaither and Faulkner read Wednesday from a March 1981 deposition in which former Camp Scott counselor Michelle Hoffman testified about finding a threatening note in the camp 's Seminole unit , less than two months before the murders . During a pre-summer preparatory session for volunteers , one of her fellow counselors discovered that her belongings had been ransacked , Hoffman said . She said a box of doughnuts belonging to the counselor had been stolen . Hoffman said she found the empty doughnut box and picked it up . She said she found inside a note , written on folded notebook paper . \" In capital letters it was printed , \" We are on a mission to kill three girls in tent one . ' It was signed \" The Killer , ' or something like that , \" she said . Hoffman said the note alarmed her at first , but she decided it was a joke . She said the counselors turned the note over to Barbara Olmstead , coordinator of the spring Camporee session at Camp Scott . She said Olmstead threw the note away . Olmstead testified in that when the counselors gave her the note , they did not tell her that the tent had been ransacked .

Physically and mystically forests have defined the environment of communities in the region throughout time . The distinction that has been made between cultural values and the forests functions is actually an artificial one . Tangibly and intangibly , forests feature in all aspects of culture : language , history , art , religion , medicine , politics , and even social structure itself . Forest trees may house the spirits of ancestors as well as those of the newborn . And forests are viewed in both positive and negative lights as sources of evil as well as power and munificence , as providers for , and hindrances to development . The mystical qualities of specific forest resources often play a crucial role in traditional healing practices . Forests provide the venue for religious , social , and healing ceremonies . Forest products such as tam - tams and forest foods such as palm wine are used in many ceremonies . Assessing the myriad of symbolic and cultural values of forests goes far beyond the scope of this study . However , this does not diminish their importance in terms of the value people place on forests and forest resources . The following discussion can only illustrate some of the ways in which forests are culturally and symbolically valued . Information on the cultural significance of forest resources can be gleaned from anthropological , ethnobotanical , geographic , ethnomedical , and linguistic studies . Such studies generally focus on a particular community or ethnic group . Thus it is difficult to compare the cultural use of forests across the region . The literature does however provide invaluable insight into peoples often seemingly contradictory views regarding forests . Abbiw ( in progress ) provides an interesting collection of information on the diversity of traditional values ascribed to forest resources throughout the region ( more than 1000 species are described ) . For example , plants associated with marriages may be used to attract a potential spouse , during the marriage ceremony , to protect marriages , or to improve them ( a talisman of Datura metel is believed to give patience so as to tolerate ones spouse ) . ( The Table in Appendix 13 shows the range of symbolic uses described by Abbiw . ) Forest trees , the links between the sky and earth , often symbolise links between the spiritual world of ancestors and people . Rituals and ceremonies which draw on forest symbols often serve to link people with their cultural heritage , as well as their ancestral past ( Calame - Griaule 1969 , 1970 ) . In an extremely interesting study , Calame - Griaule uses traditional stories and myths to analyse the symbolic function of trees in African oral tradition . The tree features in many myths and tales . It consistently reflects a few important symbolic images . The tree stands between heaven and earth and is associated with creation as well as the underworld ( cosmic tree ) . The tree is a maternal symbol : a protector and provider who gives fruit , other foods and medicines , provides a reservoir for water , protects against the elements and evil spirits . The tree often symbolizes human fecundity . It may also be a phallic and paternal symbol , symbolically linking people with their ancestors while being a symbol of political unity . Finally , the deciduous characteristic of the tree gives it an ambiguous image which reflects the trees power to give life and rebirth as well as to bring about death . In many African myths and stories , the tree is portrayed as an ancestral symbol of wisdom , authority and custom , providing a bond between the dead and the living ( Studstill 1970 ) . Similarly , in other stories Gorog - Karady ( 1970 ) relates that the tree is often symbolises a mediator and judge . Trees play a role in all facets and periods of West African peoples lives . The Oubangui ( Centre Afrique ) plant a tree in the bush for a newborn child . For female children a fast -growing profuse fruiter is planted . The childs development is linked to the growth of the tree . If tree growth declines , people fear for the health of the child and a healer is called upon . When the child is sick it is brought to the tree for treatment . When the tree begins to fruit , the time will have come for the child to marry . Throughout a persons life , gifts are occasionally left for the tree . When someone dies their spirit goes to reside in their personal birthright tree ( Vergiat 1969 ) . Ficus sycamorus : a sacred tree which grows by rivers Forests provide the venue for many cultural events . In many parts of West Africa , forest areas and specific trees are protected and valued for particular cultural occasions and as historic symbols . Each community has its own traditions associated with sacred areas and , as a result , the species that are found in them vary greatly . In an analysis of traditional African political institutions , Niangoran - Bouah ( 1983 ) notes that there are two traditional sacred locations for reunion : sacred groves and arbres a palabre . The arbre a palabre is the venue for political and social meetings : the location where elders sit under the big tree and talk until they agree . It is the location where political , judicial , and social decisions are made . Visser ( 1975 ) notes that among the Ando of C\u00f4te d Ivoire there are specific tree species which serve as arbres a palabre such as Microdesmis sp. , Blighia sapida ( also a symbol of fecundity ) , Cordia millenii , and Bombax buonopozense . Sacred groves are the site of ritual and secret society initiations , a locale where social and political values , morals , secrets , and laws are passed on to the younger generation . Sacred groves house the most important religious and ritual relics . They are often the site of ancestral burials or places where people can communicate with their ancestors . Sanago ( 1983 ) describes sacred groves in C\u00f4te dIvoire , noting that they are places where moral values are taught and passed on from one generation to the next . The trees within these groves are viewed as sacred trees , housing spirits , and providing links to ancestors . In some areas , sacred groves are the only forested areas that remain ( Koagne 1986 ) . Although many cultural traditions are disappearing with the rapidly changing social and physical environments , sacred groves often remain as valued elements of cultural heritage . The groves are also often the site for ritual healings and the location where villagers find particular plant medicines . ( The species that are often associated with sacred groves throughout the region are listed in Appendix 14 . ) In a village in Northern Ghana , Ntiamoa - Baidu ( 1987 ) describes a sacred region protected by traditional beliefs : the villagers ancestors were saved from enemies when they hid in this sacred area . Now the spirits of these ancestors and gods live there . The area is never farmed and is burnt once a year to protect it from accidental fires . Binet ( 1974 ) describes the symbolic and mystical use of forest areas valued by the Fang of Southern Cameroon . The temple ( the site of initiation ceremonies and rites ) is always situated at the foot of a large forest tree where medicinal plants are often cultivated . This tree symbolises the forest which houses the body of god and was once the source of peoples food . During initiation ceremonies , the root bark of the species Tabernantha iboga ( a hallucinogen ) is consumed by ail initiates , so that they can see god . In this culture , the tree and forest medicines are believed to be vehicles through which people communicate with god . In the Casamance region of Senegal , a traditional healer founded a healing village for mental patients at the foot of a large cottonwood tree ( Ceiba pentandra ) . The village location was chosen because the tree and surrounding forest symbolised healing and protection , a peaceful place that linked people with their god and ancestors . Village dwellings are now built around the tree ( Trincaz , J. 1980 ) . And every day , at the foot of this large tree , patients discuss their problems , undergoing the equivalent of group psychotherapy . The study concludes that this healing village demonstrates the fundamental mystical , religious , and social importance of trees in their culture . In some cases , specific resources serve as cultural symbols , linking people to a particular past . Some resources are valued throughout the region ; others are only significant to specific groups ( Ntiamoa - Baidu 1987 ) . In a study comparing the religious significance of different forest species for different West African cultures , Schnell ( 1946 ) found that Chlorophora excelsa was a sacred tree throughout the region . It was often protected , and sacrifices and gifts were given to it . Villages were often located near it , and in some cases the C. excelsa was planted in the village . The tree was especially associated with fertility and birth . For example , the Ibo ( Southern Nigeria ) believe that it furnishes the souls for the newborn ( Andoh 1986 ) . And in the Ho region of Ghana , it is ( Asamoah 1985 ) believed to be dwelling for dwarfs ; underneath it ritual sacrifices are performed . And its wood is used for making sacred drums and coffins . For the Guer\u00e9 and Oubi ( C\u00f4te d Ivoire ) , C. excelsa is also the location for ritual sacrifices ( T\u00e9h\u00e9 1980 ) . Ceiba pentandra is also a sacred tree throughout the West African region . It is usually associated with burials and ancestors ( Schnell 1946 ) . Asamoah ( 1985 ) notes that in the Ho region of Ghana , its bark and leaves are believed to expel evil spirits . ( See also Cousteix 1961 , Cameroon ; de Rosny 1981 . ) Among the Beti of Southern Cameroon , Amat and Cortadellas ( 1972 ) report that the oven tree Didelotia africana is sacred . It is thought extremely powerful and is used in many traditional healing treatments , especially those involving sorcery . It is approached for help with difficult problems ( e.g. broken marriages ) , but can only be used by healers who have the power to communicate with it . Mallart Guimera ( 1969 ) examined the symbolic importance of the oven tree ( in this case Copaifera religiosa and sometimes Guibourtia tessmannii ) to the Evuzok people of Southern Cameroon . For the Evuzok the oven tree is the most important of ail forest trees . Both C. religiosa and G. tessmannii are emergent species of the equatorial rainforest and occur at low densities . C. religiosa has a large red straight trunk . G. tessmannii is also an extremely tall species with large buttress roots . Its height , force , and uniqueness as compared to other species lend the oven tree its title of chief of all trees , controlling fecundity , wealth , power , and fame . However , the Evuzok oven tree is also a fearsome tree whose force can be used by evil spirits . Thus , it is an ambivalent symbol : it can give life , but also bring death . This duality features in many Evuzok stories and myths . Trees serve both practical and symbolic judicial roles .

Boundary Changes 1909 - 1989 After Sydney City Council was incorporated in 1842 the original boundaries remained constant until the early twentieth century , except for an expansion to take in Moore Park in 1870 . Around the edges of the City , suburban areas were incorporated as Municipal Councils from 1859 through the 1860s . Changes to Sydney City Council 's boundaries as a result of taking over responsibility for these suburban areas began in 1909 . In chronological order , the absorption and disgorgement of other municipalities by Sydney City Council has been as follows . 1909 Sydney City Council ( known as the Municipal Council of Sydney until 1949 ) took over the small and struggling Municipality of Camperdown . 1949 The City expanded further , to take in the surrounding suburban municipalities of The Glebe , Darlington , Newtown , Erskineville , Alexandria , Waterloo , Redfern , and Paddington . 1968 The City lost most of the areas it had acquired . Paddington ( north of Oxford Street ) was transferred to the Municipality of Woollahra . The Glebe was transferred to the Municipality of Leichhardt . Part of Camperdown ( west of about Church Street \/ Mallett Street north ) and part of Newtown ( west of King Street ) were transferred to the Municipality of Marrickville . The remaining part of Newtown , part of Darlington , and all of Erskineville , Alexandria , Waterloo and Redfern were combined to form the new Northcott Municipal Council , later re-named the South Sydney Municipal Council . Sydney City Council retained part of Paddington ( south of Oxford Street ) , part of Camperdown ( east of about Church Street \/ Mallett Street north ) , and part of Darlington ( corresponding roughly to the area then occupied by the University of Sydney ) . 1982 Northcott \/ South Sydney Municipal Council was abolished and all the areas lost to Northcott in 1968 returned to Sydney City Council . In addition , the City Council acquired responsibility for the Garden Island naval base . 1989 A new South Sydney City Council was created and Sydney City Council lost responsibility for all the areas it had acquired since 1909 and which had not already been transferred to Woollahra , Leichhardt or Marrickville in 1968 . In addition , it lost responsibility for some areas that had been inside the original 1842 boundaries , including parts of Ultimo and most of Surry Hills and the whole eastern side of the City from the Domain to Boundary Road , including Woolloomooloo and Kings Cross , Potts Point and Elizabeth Bay . In 1842 the area covered by Sydney City Council was 11.65 sq km . Since 1989 the City area has been only 6.19 sq km as a result of these changes . | 2003 2004 | South Sydney City Council was abolished and re-amalgamated with the City of Sydney in two stages ( May 2003 and February 2004 ) . Glebe was transferred from Leichhardt Council back to the City of Sydney ( May 2003 ) . The maps show the areas absorbed by Sydney City Council in 1909\/1949 and in 1982 . The map Wards and Boundaries 1949 - 1959 shows the municipalities absorbed in 1949 . Camperdown , absorbed in 1909 , is the area of Phillip Ward sandwiched between The Glebe to the north and Newtown \/ Darlington in the south . The map Wards and Boundaries 1982 - 1988 shows the area that returned to Sydney City Council after the abolition of Northcott \/ South Sydney Municipal Council in 1982 , marked Newtown , Redfern , Alexandria and Waterloo . The present boundaries of the City correspond to those shown in the 1982 - 88 map , plus Glebe . The History of the Archival Records Most of the surviving records of the various municipal councils absorbed by Sydney City Council over the years are now held by the City of Sydney Archives . The Northcott \/ South Sydney Municipal Council recordswere inherited directly , when that Council was abolished and re-absorbed by the City in 1982 . Similarly the South Sydney City Council records ( and Leichhardt records relating to Glebe ) were transferred directlky in 2003 - 2004 as part of the re-amalgamation process . The history of the records of the other Councils is more complex and not all the facts are known . Very few Camperdown records have survived , and it is possible this is connected to the circumstances in which the City took over responsibility in 1909 . Camperdown was in serious financial difficulties . The Town Hall had been sold off in a sheriff 's sale and many records were in the hands of the official receiver . Sydney City Council officials soon complained about inadequate records . It seems the poor survival of Camperdown records is due to a combination of poor record -keeping by Camperdown officials and the dispersal of records resulting from the financial crisis . The records of the municipalities absorbed in 1949 were transferred to Sydney City Council , and seem to have been more or less dumped in the Queen Victoria Building , which by then was being used largely for Council offices and storage space . Eventually these records were transferred to the Manuscripts department of the Mitchell Library , from where they were transferred back to the City of Sydney Archives in 1992 and 2003 . Some Glebe Municipal Council records also turned up in Leichhardt Council storage during the 2003 re-acquisition of Glebe . The records that have come to the City of Sydney Archives , from the municipalities absorbed in 1949 , are not complete . For example we have very few subject and correspondence files . The principal series of records that we do have are the Minute Books , and Rate and Valuation Books . The records of the Northcott \/ South Sydney Municipal Council , 1968 - 1982 , by contrast are extensive and fairly complete . Using the Archives To make effective use of the archival records of absorbed Councils , your research must begin by determining which municipal council was responsible for the area you wish to look at , at the time the records would have been created . The table above , the maps below , and the notes about each municipality on the following pages can help you , as a starting point . Maps : The City of Sydney Wards and Boundaries 1949-1959 The City of Sydney Wards and Boundaries 1982- 1988 In using the maps , remember that they are based on a modern street grid . A century ago street alignments and grids were different . Many streets did not yet exist , others had different names or even ran in different directions . Street numbers also changed sometimes , when either whole streets were renumbered or new numbers were added within a street as new buildings were constructed . Click here to see a map of Newtown in 1886 , which illustrates the differences in street layouts a century ago and today . At the Archives we have maps from this period for all the municipalities absorbed in 1949 . Researchers can use them to identify nineteenth - century addresses and locations , and they also show the boundaries of Wards ( electoral areas ) within the municipalities , which is vital information for making successful use of many of the Valuation and Rate Books which are arranged according to Wards . Some areas have changed hands several times . Two examples are shown in this table . 221 King Street Newtown 1862-1948 1948-1968 1968 + Newtown Municipal Council Sydney City Council Marrickville Municipal Council 476 Gardeners Road Beaconsfield 1859 1860-1868 1868-1948 1949-1968 1968-1982 1982-1988 1989-2004 2004 + Redfern Municipal Council Waterloo Municipal Council Alexandria Municipal Council Sydney City Council Northcott \/ South Sydney M C Sydney City Council South Sydney City Council Sydney City Council Once you have discovered which municipality had the responsibility , you can use Archives Investigator to find out about the admistrative history of the municipality and what records are available in the Archives .

Records Series Details Some of the records series we hold , for the pre-1949 municipalities , are described generically in this table . For more information aboiut particular series , see Archives Investigator . Minute Books These records contain the records of business transacted at meetings of the Councillors . They generally include notes of : which Councillors were present , election of the Mayor , correspondence received and sent , reports submitted by Council officers about what they have been doing , discussion about current local issues of concern to the Council , and decisions reached about particular matters . The extent to which discussion among the Councillors is recorded in the Minutes varies from Council to Council . The reports by Council officers are mostly not recorded in any detail . The Minute books record meetings chronologically , and they are not generally indexed . Assessment and Valuation Books Assessment ( also called valuation ) of properties was carried out in order to determine how much each property was worth ( usually improved or unimproved capital value : ICV or UCV ) so that the right amount of rates could be levied in the following years . Properties were not always assessed \/ valued every year . Assessment books are records created by the municipal councils themselves , while Valuation books are copies of the records compiled by the NSW Valuer - General . Many Councils had given up doing their own assessments by 1949 , and made use of the VG 's records instead . These records are generally arranged by street addresses of the properties , not by names of property owners . They are sometimes also divided by Wards . They usually note : the property address , brief description ( eg \" house \" ) , the name of the owner , occupier and \/ or lessee , and details of the valuation figures . Valuation books also usually give the dimensions of the land .

Enterprising inventors , teachers , and braille users have sought to expand the possibilities of the braille cell by increasing the number of dots from six to eight . These expansions have resulted in a cell that is two dots wide and four dots high . Instead of the 63 possible dot combinations in a six - dot cell , an eight - dot cell yields 255 possible dot combinations . Typically , the dots of the eight - dot braille cell are numbered 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 downward on the left and 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 downward on the right . BANA recognizes that eight - dot braille systems have proven to be extremely useful , particularly in the technical areas such as mathematics and the sciences . While BANA currently has no official codes that incorporate eight dots , BANA plans to closely monitor all developments in the area of code extensions involving additional dots and will continue to assess their utility through its technical committees . This paper will provide an overview of eight - dot braille , its historic uses and modern developments . As the use of braille evolved throughout the world , there have been at least three instances where an eight - dot \" braille \" cell has been used for a special purpose . In each of these cases , several eight - dot braille slates were developed to enable users of the special code to write the eight - dot code in addition to reading it . Abreu . An eight - dot code was introduced in Spain for the purpose of reading and writing music notation . It was named for its creator , Gabriel Abreu , a blind music teacher . The Abreu code was officially recognized by the Royal Spanish Conservatory of Music and Oratory in 1855 to be \" an appropriate system for teaching music to the blind \" and the author was granted royal patent rights ( Aller , 1990 ) . Virtually unknown outside Spain , the Abreu system was extremely popular among its users because it evolved much more quickly than the tactile form of music developed by Louis Braille . The braille music system of the nineteenth century only covered the basics of music notation . The foundation of the more complete modern braille music code , \" Braille Music Notation , \" was not published until 1929 . Using eight dots with their 255 possible combinations , this code permitted the writing of all of the musical signs in addition to text . The four upper dots of the cell represented the musical note while the four lower dots represented the duration of the note sound . When text was present , the letters were represented in the bottom part of the cell and the upper part was only used for music signs . As is common in print music , Abreu placed each syllable of text next to its corresponding note . This arrangement was not always possible in the braille music system . Many music scores were published in the Abreu eight - dot code . The Abreu system was used in the National School for the Blind in Madrid , as well as in other regions of the country , from 1856 to well into the 1950s . While some material still exists today , a sixdot braille music code was officially adopted in Spain in the early 1950s . Stenographic Code . Another example of eight - dot braille was used in Austria and West Germany in the mid-twentieth century . This was a shorthand code used by blind stenographers . In 1943 , the Deutsche Einheitsstenographie , a six - dot stenographic code was first published . In 1952 , this code was extended by the Deutsche Verhandlungsstenographie , a seven - dot stenographic code in former East Germany . In the same year , a group of blind stenographers headed by Werner Castritius , proposed an eight - dot version for Austria and West Germany . The final version of the eight - dot stenographic code was published in 1961 . This code was widely used into the 1980s but has been slowly replaced by computer - based stenographic methods . Tenkanji and Kantenji . Tenji , the system of standard Japanese braille in use since 1890 does not permit the direct brailling of the Japanese Kanji , the Chinese characters that are used in the modern Japanese logographic writing system . It was generally thought that access to these characters could bring blind people closer to mainstream print used by sighted Japanese people thus facilitating communication and a common understanding about their language ( Dasgupta , 2002 ) . However , with over 10,000 kanji in common use , devising a braille code to represent this form of print was a formidable task . In the 1950's , Taiji Kawakami , a sighted teacher at a school for the blind in Osaka , developed kantenji , an eight - dot code to represent kanji . This code used the upper two dots of the cell to indicate that it was a kanji character and in two or three cells , constructed the braille characters to reflect the visual appearance of the original kanji . In 1966 , Sadao Hasegawa , a blind teacher at a school for the blind in Tokyo , created a six - dot braille system for brailling kanji called tenkanji . Hasegawa 's six - dot code took a very different approach from that of Kawakami . Each kanji character in six - dot tenkanji occupies three or four braille cells . Each character begins with a kanji indicator and is constructed from among several elements ( semantic , phonetic , and so forth ) of the character in an effort to avoid confusion with other characters . The selection of which elements to use to represent a character was based largely on the frequency of the word in everyday language . The introduction of computer - based technology into our everyday lives has had a profound effect on the options available to braille users . In the early 1970s , braille embossers became available from Triformation Systems , Inc. that were capable of embossing eight - dot braille . \" The Triformation embossers added a seventh and eighth dot to the braille cell , thus expanding the braille code into an eight - bit code that could display 256 combinations .... \" ( Cranmer , 2000 p.154 ) . While these were not the first machines capable of embossing braille , they were the first known units that could produce an expanded version of the North American ASCII - Braille Code . ASCII ( the American Standard Code for Information Interchange ) , the basic character code used by computers is a seven - bit code consisting of 128 characters ( 0 - 127 ) . It is composed of uppercase and lowercase letters , numbers , punctuation marks , a few special symbols , and some control characters . ASCII has 95 printable characters . To represent ASCII in six - dot braille , with only 64 combinations ( including the space ) , the ASCII values between 96 and 127 ( lowercase letters and a few punctuation marks ) had been mapped to the corresponding symbols between 64 and 95 ( uppercase letters and a few more punctuation marks ) , making upper - and lowercase letters and several pairs of punctuation marks indistinguishable when represented with a single braille cell . When more dots are available , the addition of dots seven and \/ or eight to some of the characters yields a unique braille symbol for each ASCII value . With these new embossers , the 95 printable ASCII characters could be represented by a single cell each . Additional cells are not needed to represent uppercase letters , the full array of punctuation marks or other ASCII symbols that have no representation in literary braille . In the expanded North American ASCII - Braille code , the uppercase letters retain their original form and are usually structured by adding dot seven at the bottom- left of the cell . This strategy generally worked well because it did not require the user to learn a completely new braille code . Having braille embossers capable of representing unambiguous text was a great boon to many blind people who were then finding employment in the burgeoning field of computer programming . But for the next ten years , eight - dot braille produced from a computer continued to be the exclusive province of computer programmers and the like . It was not until the introduction of refreshable braille displays and their use to read a computer screen that the use of eight - dot braille became more widespread among average braille users . Early refreshable braille displays , such as the Digicassette , the VersaBraille , and the Microbraille were all six -dot displays . These devices were initially developed for reading material stored in memory or on removable media . But as refreshable braille displays began to be used interactively with a computer screen , six dots proved again not to be enough to work efficiently . Again , more than six dots were needed to represent the printable characters of the ASCII character set . With the introduction of the IBM PC , an extended version of the ASCII character set was developed that included 256 characters . The additional 128 characters were mostly mathematics , graphical , and foreign characters but since braille embossers and braille displays already had eight dots , they were easily able to represent the entire range of the new eight - bit character set . By the late 1980s , most refreshable braille displays had eight dots per cell and used eight - dot braille codes that varied slightly from country to country . In addition to representing characters , the presence of the additional two dots per cell allowed the display to show highlighted or otherwise enhanced items and enabled the user to determine the location of the computer cursor or the mouse pointer without obscuring the underlying character . There is , however , still no accepted standard for eight - dot braille in the United States . Some believe that advances in computer technology may negate the need for an eight - dot braille display . Eight - dot braille became the norm for refreshable braille displays because it could provide a one - to - one representation of the computer screen , particularly in the 1980s and early 1990s , as refreshable braille devices became common in the <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Source_symbol\": [], \"Target_symbol\": [], \"Source_representation\": [\"the Japanese Kanji\"], \"Content\": [\"the Chinese characters that are used in the modern Japanese logographic writing system\"], \"Time\": [\"In the 1950's\", \"In 1966\"], \"Cognizer\": [\"Taiji Kawakami\", \"Sadao Hasegawa\"], \"Place\": [\"at a school for the blind in Osaka\"], \"Target_representation\": [\"kantenji , an eight - dot code to represent kanji\"]}"}

The blaze began shortly after the southbound Blue Train \u2014 one of two that make up the downtown monorail system \u2014 left Seattle Center for the mile - long trip to Westlake Center . Fire crews approaching the scene were met by black smoke pouring down Fifth Avenue . Passengers said nearly 100 people were on the train when the fire started . Thick smoke quickly filled the train as passengers \u2014 some screaming , others calm \u2014 forced their way toward the front . The rescue of dozens of stranded passengers came on the final day of the Northwest Folklife Festival , which had attracted thousands to Seattle Center . As hundreds of fairgoers watched , some passengers made their way down a firefighter 's ladder that had been hoisted to a door in the front of the train . The system 's second train pulled up alongside the damaged train , allowing some passengers to board before returning to its base at Seattle Center . \" The outcome could have been very different , \" said Fire Department spokeswoman Helen Fitzpatrick . \" No one jumped , which is a good thing . \" Power was shut off to the monorail , and the service was shut down indefinitely . About 40 passengers were evaluated for smoke inhalation and eight were taken to Harborview Medical Center , Fitzpatrick said . One firefighter was sent to the hospital with an injured knee , she added . All were released last night , according to a Harborview nursing supervisor . \" It really did n't take the Fire Department that long to show up , \" said Marlene Schwartzmann , who along with her husband , son and daughter was in the rear car of the monorail when the fire started . \" But as the inside of the monorail turned pitch black , it began feeling like an eternity . \" The Schwartzmanns , of Tampa , Fla. , had begun their vacation in Seattle less than 24 hours earlier . They spent several hours at Seattle Center and took a ride up the Space Needle yesterday before hopping on the monorail back to Westlake Center . They were the last ones on the train and were jammed into the back car , standing . Holly Schwartzmann , 15 , said she heard a pop and saw a spark that appeared to be coming up from the floor near the window . The lights immediately went out , her mother added . \" Everyone began pushing forward , \" Marlene Schwartzmann said . \" It felt like 100 to 150 people in there . It was pitch black . \" As they hovered on the tracks in the burning train , \" People were looking up taking pictures , \" Holly Schwartzmann said . Her father added : \" You look down , and you see all those people looking up at you . You ca n't jump , it 's too high . You feel trapped . \" His wife added : \" I 'd say this is the highlight of our vacation . We 're lucky it 's a happy ending . \" The proposed Green Line monorail will be required to have emergency escape walkways along its 14 - mile length . The monorail was built in 1962 for the Seattle World 's Fair . The two trains have traveled more than 1.8 million miles on the one - mile stretch of tracks . The system carries more than 2 million passengers a year . The most serious accident in the monorail 's 42 - year history was in 1971 , when the braking system on the Red Train failed , sending it crashing into a steel girder at the Seattle Center station . Twenty six people were hurt . The monorail occasionally breaks down , and passengers usually transfer to another train that pulls alongside . But fire ladders are sometimes used , including twice in 2002 . Construction of the monorail cost $ 3.5 million , and it was built in 10 months . Its supporting structure required 15,000 tons of concrete . Each train rides on 16 tires and each has 24 more tires suspended sideways to hug the rail .

Bancroft , National Center for Environmental Prediction Typhoon Nida : Nida entered OPC 's oceanic area for ( Mercator ) radiofacsimile charts near 29N 136E at 1200 UTC May 20 with maximum sustained winds of 80 KT and gusts to 100 KT . The cyclone moved northeast and weakened to a tropical storm six hours later . By 0600 UTC on the 21st Nida was about 250 nmi northeast of Tokyo with maximum winds 45 KT with gusts to 55 KT , about to become extratropical . Figure 1 shows Typhoon Nida approaching a frontal zone and becoming an extratropical storm at 1200 UTC May 21 east of Japan . While Nida was still a typhoon , the Mokihanai ( WNRD ) encountered southwest winds of 50 KT and 10.5 m seas ( 35 ft ) near 22N 132E at 0000 UTC May 20 . The vessel CMA CGM Alabama ( DGGV ) ( 24N 137E ) reported south winds of 40 KT and 6.5 m seas ( 21 ft ) six hours later . The Sea- Land Reliance ( WFLH ) reported east winds of 45 KT near 39N 149E at 0000 UTC on the 21st , and east winds at 50 KT near 41N 153E twelve hours later . The extratropical storm attained a central pressure of 988 h Pa near 40N 148E at 1800 UTC May 21 , when the President Jackson ( WRYC ) encountered east winds of 50 KT 60 nmi to the north . After that , the system that was Nida continued to move northeast and weakened . Tropical Storm Omais : Omais followed Nida on a similar track south of Japan as a minimal tropical storm on May 21 , with maximum sustained winds of 35 KT with gusts to 45 KT . The cyclone then weakened to a tropical depression near 21N 136E at 0600 UTC May 22 , before becoming extratropical and merging with a frontal zone near 40N 150E two days later . By 0000 UTC May 27 the low- pressure area that was Omais redeveloped into a gale with a central pressure of 985 hPa just south of the western Aleutians . The system then tracked east-northeast , stalled and weakened in the central Gulf of Alaska late on May 29 . Super Typhoon Dianmu : Dianmu appeared on OPC 's Mercator oceanic analysis area near 16N 135E , or 1000 nmi south of Japan , at 1800 UTC June 16 with maximum sustained winds of 155 KT with gusts to 190 KT , the strongest typhoon of the period . The cyclone then tracked west-northwest , west of the area while gradually weakening , before recurving to the northeast on the 20th and weakening to a tropical storm near the southwest coast of Japan at 1800 UTC on June 20 . The President Trumani ( WNDP ) encountered southeast winds of 40 KT near 33N 136E six hours later . Dianmu then moved northeast into the Sea of Japan near 39N 138E at 1200 UTC on the 21st with maximum winds of 40 KT with gusts to 50 KT . The cyclone became an extratropical gale over northern Japan later on the 21st , followed by weakening in the Sea of Okhotsk on June 23 . The remains of Dianmu then dissipated over the northwest Bering Sea late on June 25 . Tropical Storm Mindulle : Tropical Depression 10W formed near 16N 144E at 0600 UTC June 23 and moved west-northwest , becoming Tropical Storm Mindulle six hours later with maximum sustained winds of 35 KT with gusts to 45 KT . The cyclone reached 17N 140E at 0000 UTC on the 24th before turning more southwest and passing west of 135E late on June 24 , with maximum sustained winds of 55 KT with gusts to 70 KT . Typhoon Tingting : Tingting entered OPC 's map area near 16N 146E as a minimal typhoon while moving northwest , and developed maximum sustained winds as high as 80 KT with gusts to 100 KT when the center was near 19N 144E at 1800 UTC June 28 . By month 's end an approaching cold front from the northwest turned Tingting more to the north . By 1200 UTC July 1 the cyclone weakened to a tropical storm near 30N 144E with maximum winds of 55 KT with gusts to 70 KT , and began a turn toward the northeast . Tingting weakened to an extratropical gale ( 990 h Pa ) near 38N 156E at 0000 UTC July 4 , and then re-intensified into a storm - force low with a central pressure as low as 980 hPa ( Figure 2 ) near 48N 164E , where it stalled . Some ship observations taken during the passage of Tingting are listed in Table 1 . The second part of Figure 2 shows only some ship reports of gale - force winds east of the front associated with extratropical Tingting , but the QuikSCAT image in Figure 3 has a 50 KT wind barb near 45N 167E , supporting the classification of the system as a storm . | OBSERVATION ||POSITION||DATA \/ TIME ( UTC ) ||WIND||SEAS ( M\/FT ) | | Sea - Land Trader | ( KIRH ) | 35N 143E | |02\/0000||NE 40 ||8.0\/26 | | Brooklyn Bridge | ( 3EZJ9 ) | 36N 143E | |02\/000||N 40 ||6.0\/20 | | Aichi Maru | ( JEGI ) | 29N 149E||02\/0900||S 35 | | Century Leader No. 3 | ( JADY ) | 33N 154E||03\/0600 ||S 47||6.5\/22 | | 33.5N 154E||03\/1200||SW 50 | Table 1 . Some notable ship observations taken during Tropical Storm Tingting . The strong low that was Tingting then remained stationary and weakened to below gale strength early on July 6 , before becoming absorbed by a developing low passing to the south late on the same day . Typhoon Namtheun : Tropical Depression 13W formed near 23N 150E at 0600 UTC July 25 and moved northwest while rapidly intensifying , becoming Typhoon Namtheun only eighteen hours later near 25N 148E with maximum sustained winds of 65 KT with gusts to 80 KT . Namtheun attained a peak intensity of 115 KT sustained winds with gusts to 140 KT at 1800 UTC on the 26th when the center reached 27N 147E . Gradual weakening followed while the cyclone continued to move northwest , and Namtheun passed west of 135E , about 100 nmi south of Japan , as a strong tropical storm by month 's end , implying maximum sustained winds of 60 KT with gusts to 75 KT . The Bishu Marui ( JGAC ) encountered southeast winds of 40 KT near 30N 140E and 31N 140E at 1800 UTC July 29 and 0000 UTC July 30 , respectively . Namtheun later recurved northeast into the Sea of Japan and became extratropical west of northern Japan early on August 2 , before becoming absorbed by a larger low inland over Asia on the 3rd. Typhoon Meranti : Tropical Depression 14W formed near 19N 166E at 1800 UTC August 3 and intensified to a tropical storm six hours later while moving north . Tropical Storm 14W appears in the lower part of Figure 4 . The cyclone was named Meranti near 26N 166E at 0600 UTC August 5 and it continued to strengthen , becoming a typhoon six hours later near 27N 167E with maximum winds of 65 KT with gusts to 80 KT . The peak intensity came at 1800 UTC August 5 near 28N 167E , with maximum sustained winds of 90 KT and gusts to 110 KT . The cyclone then weakened to a tropical storm twenty - four hours later while turning more northeast into OPC 's high seas area ( Reference 2 ) , near 32N 170E . Meranti then continued to weaken and became extratropical near 38N 172E early on August 8 , where it stalled and later became absorbed by a larger Bering Sea low by the 13th . Tropical Depression 15W : This cyclone made a brief appearance , moving from west of the area into the Sea of Japan near 38N 135E at 0000 UTC August 5 ( Figure 4 ) with maximum winds of 30 KT with gusts to 40 KT . The cyclone moved northeast and became extratropical , and was absorbed by a frontal system over northern Japan on the 5th .

This later changed ; the area 's commercial activity began to be referred to as \" popular markets , \" connoting a perceived demographic <event> shift <\/event> in the kinds of people frequenting the markets . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> In a paper presented at a conference about Amman in 1995 , the late architect Jafar Touqan described the urban expansions that occurred in Amman beginning in the 1960s as \u201c surprise convulsions . \u201d Touqan , who began working in architectural design in Amman at the start of the 1960s , saw the city as it grew , fleeing its center by jarring leaps in urbanization . For several decades of contemporary Amman 's existence , this center constituted the whole of Amman . Even when the city grew , the center retained its distinguishing feature as a public sphere in which all of the capital 's residents would gather , as well as all of the arrivals from different areas of the country . Here , there were relatively splendid hotels and Faisal square , in which celebrations and public shows were held . Here was Al - Husseini mosque , in which the king would lead Friday prayer amid a throng of people . Here was the Roman Theater and its various events such as wrestling and boxing matches , in which Fairuz sang , and where an ice-skating show was held ! Similarly , the national celebration of the victory of the Algerian revolution was also held there . And in this center , markets were established and were frequented by all classes of society . Until recently , for example , the gold market in Al - Shabsough area still attracted the brides of Amman . Likewise , the rest of the markets that later took the name \u201c popular markets \u201d were previously just considered central markets . It was also here that the first market following the emergence of the poverty phenomenon in Amman was established . It is called the \u201c Yamaniya Market , \u201d and it started as a marketplace for secondhand European clothes that piqued people 's curiosity and their imaginations , and continued to the present with a short interruption of two years . The interruption was due to the new market owner 's attempt to transform it into a modern marketplace like the rest of the nearby markets . He put a large sign up bearing a new name . Longtime workers remember however , that customers refused the market name change via a popular protest that was neither organized nor officially announced , and that manifested as a boycott of the shops in the new market . This hindered the attempt to replace the market 's content , which soon recovered its characteristics , and these remain essentially the same to this day . Slowly , but notably , Amman began to flee from its center , which took shape as the \u201c bottom of the city . \u201d This term , when referring to Amman , was a new terminology . The city was alienating itself from its center and exalting itself from it . It is true that , from an early period , a number of markets were established in parts of central Amman with marginal ( urban ) activity : the Halal market was established to buy and sell livestock near Ras Al - Ain , then the Al - Haddada and Al - Samkara markets were established . A market for street vendors was set up , and recently became known as \u201c Al - Jora , \u201d as well as a market commonly called \u201c Souq Al - Haramia , \u201d in which the business of selling used commodities spread . However , the center of the city remained a generally active and popular place for different residents in the 1970s and for most of the 1980s . In the \u201c public mind \u201d of Amman residents and Jordanians generally , the city was united to a great degree at that time . It should be noted that at the start of the 1980s , journalist Fakhri Kawar wrote an article titled \u201c East Amman and West Amman . \u201d The title alone was guaranteed to provoke a storm of protest and intense debate about the matter , due to the strangeness of that characterization at the time . According to the late novelist Abdelrahman Munif , who wrote in his book , \u201c Story of a City : Amman in the 1940s \u201d , the most beautiful and accurate description of Amman at that time , the marginalized people of Amman were a major and present part of the life of all social classes . The Adaptability of the Marginalized The preceding paragraphs are not a precise history of the center of Amman , but they are an attempt to pave the way for the subject of this article , namely the shifts in marginalization in Amman 's center during the last few years . The press archive clarifies that at the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s , a broad debate revolved around the problem of Amman 's center , and especially the issue of public transportation and public and private modes of transportation . As part of confronting the problem , the Raghadan Transportation Complex was established in 1974 and hosted many transportation routes , especially those that connect the center of the capital to the southern and eastern regions , including Zarqa and Al - Rasifa and their villages and camps . I still maintain the detailed written description that I wrote in 1997 about socio-economic life on the popular level in the Amman center area , specifically in the area extending between the ( old ) Raghadan Tourist Complex and the \u201c Saqif Al - Sail \u201d area . This was in the context of a scientific anthropological study that discussed the informal \u201c marginalized \u201d economy in that location . At the time , life proceeded in this place 24 hours a day , especially in the space stretching between the Raghadan Tourist Complex and the Hashemite Plaza , arriving at the Al- Husseini Mosque . Transportation service east to Zarqa was continuous and available non-stop , including medium size buses , and restaurants offered their services to customers perpetually as well . During this period , arrivals from Iraq after the Gulf War ( 1991 ) and the years of siege that followed distinguished the public scene of central Amman . Since a large number of Egyptian migrant workers were living there , the Iraqi and Egyptian elements blended together . Naturally , the Iraqis in this place were not generally from affluent sections of the population , so they joined working - class Amman residents in settling their families in nearby areas and overlooking hills . During field research that lasted nine months , I was able to survey the social components of this area . Since my research targeted the informal sector and especially street vendors in the area , I became acquainted with the degree of complexity of the internal organization of this popular market , which extends along the pavements and sidewalks of the streets . The marginalized people of the city were greatly present in this space on all weekdays , especially on Friday , which forms the peak of their activity . During that time , the whole area took shape and reshaped itself to assist the changes taking place . Every morning , the area witnessed the movement of hundreds of thousands of citizens , just as it saw their return in the evening . In response , the market sought to match their needs , and this effort included the formal and informal sectors . Thus , as required services and shops were set up , vegetable stands became numerous at the last spots before people climbed onto buses and taxis . That way , customers did n't have to carry their purchases for long distances . In the westernmost part of the area , at the end of \u201c Saqif Al - Sail , \u201d there is a relatively large plaza located next to the public street , which drops by two meters in some places . Called \u201c Al - Jora , \u201d it is the biggest market for street vendors . At the start of the 1980s , the vendors were ordered to leave the area due to the need to build a commercial building there . Another space was allocated for them , located exactly at the east of the Al - Mahatta bridge , and a building was erected there . It was divided into \u201c numbers , \u201d and the space of each was six square meters . These were distributed to the owners of the street vendor stands expelled from \u201c Al - Jora . \u201d And with this , one of the first sites of marginalization to the east was established , and would expand later . However , \u201c Al - Jora \u201d remained empty , and the construction of the commercial building did not begin until 2018 , 45 years since the evacuation of the original street vendors . During that time , other marginalized activities were undertaken in \u201c Al - Jora , \u201d especially the business of selling secondhand goods . It was also occasionally used as a taxi parking lot , and in some years , vendors were permitted to set up stands there in exchange for fees . The \u201c Solidere \u201d Project of Amman From the beginning of the 2000s , the scene changed gradually but continuously . In 2003 , the Greater Amman Municipality announced the launch of a project to rebuild the Raghadan Complex with a Japanese grant of eight million dinars . For this purpose , the place was sealed with metal fences , and the Municipality allocated three years to finish the project . During that time , necessary facilities were built in the public space located near Al - Mahatta bridge in eastern central Amman to gather traffic temporarily , in anticipation of the Raghadan Complex 's completion . Indeed , after three years , the completion of the project was announced . The metal fences were removed , and May 25 , 2006 ( Independence Day ) was set as the inauguration of the project . But days before the set date , Omar Al - Ma'ani , the mayor of Amman at the time , announced the cancellation of the inauguration , and then the repeal of the idea of the Complex itself . At the time , it was said that the large ultra-modern building would be rehabilitated for tourism purposes , and it was said literally that the center of the capital must not be just a corridor for road crossings and users of public transportation . During those three years , many people readied themselves to respond to the return of the Complex . They constructed new buildings , merchants updated their existing shops , and the owners of licensed kiosks signed new contracts with the Municipality , which allocated places for them in the new building . Thus , the relinquishment of the Raghadan Complex constituted a surprise to many , and entered everyone in a debate that resulted in instances of protest that included the formal and informal sectors . Thereafter , the Municipality implemented a series of measures . Among these was permitting people to use the complex as a <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Initial_quality\": [], \"Value_range\": [], \"Final_situation\": [], \"Initial_situation\": [], \"Place\": [\"Amman\"], \"Time\": [\"in the 1960s\"], \"Entity\": [\"markets\"], \"Attribute\": [\"by all classes of society\"], \"Final_category\": [\"\\u201c popular markets\"], \"Initial_category\": [\"central markets\"], \"Final_quality\": [\"a marketplace for secondhand European clothes\"]}"}

Responding to this market <event> metamorphosis <\/event> , L'eggs began emphasizing their higher - priced products , reaching out to the conservative market segments that were still requiring formal skirts , hose and heels in the office . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Pat McGuire , a human resources consultant in Chicago , was shopping during lunch hour in the hosiery department of Marshall Field 's , but instead of packages of pantyhose , she was buying knee - high stockings . McGuire 's company last year loosened its dress code , permitting pants in the office . McGuire 's switch to a blazer , trousers and flats instead of a suit with a skirt , stockings and high heels for work is being repeated millions of times around the country with varying degrees of informality . The trend has , of course , changed the business of apparel retailing forever . But it also is hurting sales in the $ 2.2 billion sheer - hosiery market . Chicago - based Sara Lee Corp. , the country 's leading manufacturer and marketer of sheer hosiery , has been feeling the negative impact of the casual trend for several years . Sara Lee 's mass - marketed L'Eggs brand , its department store brand Hanes , and its up - market Donna Karan and DKNY hosiery lines together have about 47 percent of the market , according to a recent report from Prudential Securities . Sara Lee also is a leading hosiery company in Europe with brands including Dim in France , Pretty Polly in the United Kingdom and Vatter in Germany . In June 1994 , after watching hosiery sales drop 5 to 7 percent a year for the previous three years , Sara Lee restructured and eliminated 8,300 jobs , cutting U.S. hosiery capacity by 5 percent and making cuts in European manufacturing as well . Since then , casual dress in the workplace has become even more firmly entrenched , and an increasing number of women are taking advantage of communications technology to work at home . The downward trend has continued to be reflected in Sara Lee 's numbers . In fiscal 1996 ended June 30 , the company reported legwear volumes declined 9 percent . This month Sara Lee closed a distribution center , which employed 110 people , in Champaign . The company attributed the move to excess capacity . Sara Lee certainly is n't alone in feeling the pinch . Hosiery manufacturers at all levels of the market are having to find new ways to attract customers . Stores now must stock a wide variety of sheers , opaques and figure - enhancing styles to meet customers ' varied modes of dressing . And in department stores , each of these styles must be represented in a range of prices -- from $ 4 to as much as $ 50 . \" Being in the sheer - hosiery business now is a struggle , \" said Kathy Reynolds , president of Kenosha , Ill . - based Jockey International 's women 's division . Jockey , whose Jockey for Her line of underwear boosted the company 's fortunes , has been in the hosiery business since 1988 , just in time for the casual trend to take its toll . But women have n't gone cold turkey on hosiery . In many professions , including law and accounting where women have become prominent , informal attire still is unacceptable . These women are willing to spend on hosiery at the high end of the market . Marsha Kreucher , a communications director at a company in Hillsdale , Mich . , recently was in Chicago for a seminar and found time to carefully match Hanes Sheer Resilience colors -- at $ 7 a pair -- with a dress she had just purchased . \" I still wear a skirt and hose to work every day , \" Kreuscher said . Each of the competitors in the market is trying to find a quality in its product for which it can charge a slightly higher price , boosting profits even though volume may be shrinking . In the department store arena , the average price for a pair of pantyhose is $ 7 . At Jockey , a midprice department store brand with prices ranging from $ 5 to $ 7 , the company emphasizes fit and comfort , which builds customer loyalty , according to Reynolds . \" One of the biggest complaints women have is the ( short ) life of the product . And one of the things that contributes to damage is if they do n't fit properly , \" she said . Though Sara Lee 's hosiery volume is down , its operating income in the U.S. hosiery business increased at a double - digit rate . That 's because the company is putting emphasis on products that promise benefits such as body shaping for women of the Baby Boom generation who may not be as trim as they used to be . Another product benefit helped by new weaving technology is the combination of sheerness for fashion and strength for wearability . These extras , which are being incorporated into all three of its U.S. lines , can boost the price of any item by $ 1 or more . Singer Tina Turner will be showing up in television commercials for Hanes this fall as the personification of that quality . \" It 's all about strength and beauty , \" the ad campaign says . Hanes also is sponsoring Turner 's concert tour , which will hit the United States later this year . Sara Lee also hopes to keep the interest of the customer for its lower - priced L'Eggs line with actress Jamie Lee Curtis as spokeswoman . Though women are buying fewer packages of stockings , they are n't necessarily scrimping on what they do buy . \" There is a lot of activity in the high end , \" said Jockey 's Reynolds . \" Women will buy moderately priced hose for every day , but turn to a designer line for an evening out or special occasions . \" One of the newest department store competitors is Wolford , a line from Austria , with prices starting at $ 36 for a simple sheer . Wolford promises a luxurious feel , coupled with durability . \" With the emphasis on designer lines and value - added items , the market could grow in terms of dollars , \" despite the downtrend in volume , Reynolds said . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Entity\": [\"in the $ 2.2 billion sheer - hosiery market\"], \"Time\": [\"for several years\"], \"Initial_category\": [\"mass - marketed L'Eggs brand\"], \"Place\": [\"U.S.\"], \"Final_category\": [\"in the high end\"]}"}

His three sons laid him to rest next to his father in accordance with his last wishes . Mr Egal , 80 , died in South Africa on Friday while undergoing surgery at a military hospital . The self - declared republic of Somaliland broke away from the rest of Somalia in 1991 . Mr Egal was elected president in 1993 but the break - away republic was never recognised by the international community . Holy words Around 4,000 people attended the funeral , an eye-witness told the BBC 's Hassan Barise in the Somali capital , Mogadishu by telephone . The governments of Ethiopia and Djibouti were represented , said businessman Abdullahi Aden Hirsi . The Ethiopian delegation was led by the deputy minister of foreign affairs . Our correspondent says that Ethiopia is trying to divide Somalia and supports Somaliland 's independence , while Djibouti is pushing for Somali unity . Mr Egal 's long time opponents , Suleman Gal and Ahmed Silanyo , were also there . The vice- president of Somaliland , Dahir Riyale Kahin , was inaugurated as the new leader on Friday . Although seven days of national mourning have been declared , our correspondent says that flags are not flying at half - mast because the emblem includes holy Islamic words . Power-struggle Mr Egal , who had been undergoing treatment for a number of ailments - ranging from rheumatism and hypertension to diabetes and cancer - died from what are described as complications following surgery . Mohamed Egal had just had his term of office extended for another year in a final bid to secure the international recognition he craved . Somaliland managed to avoid the descent into anarchy seen in the rest of Somalia but our correspondent says that Mr Egal 's death raises fears of a power - struggle and possible instability . Mr Kahin comes from the Gudabirsi clan , whereas Mr Egal was a member of Somaliland 's dominant Issak clan .

Isidore Newman F , Salesman British c.1916\u20131944 MBE Captured , and <event> shot <\/event> at Mauthausen on 6 September 1944 with 45 other agents . <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> National Archives SOE Personal File HS9\/1096\/2 Captain Isidore Newman [ Paul McCue Books ] Isidore on a cycling holiday Mathausen Quarry Today Mathausen Quarry then showing the stairs of Death Isidore ( Izzy ) Newman was born in Leeds on the 26th January 1916 , to Joseph and Tilly Newman [ nee Cohen ] . His parents were Russian Jewish immigrants who had arrived in Britain from Lithuania in 1909 . Joseph 's original surname was Naviprutsky . The surname was changed when they immigrated . He was one of thirteen brothers and sisters , who chose to stay and perished in the Holocaust . Two younger brothers escaped with the Polish army in 1939 , and eventually reached Israel , where their families still live . The Newmans were married at New Briggate Synagogue , Leeds on the 11th June 1912 , prior to which Joseph had been living at 8 Gledhow Terrace and Tilly at 22 Whitlock Street . Both were tailors and pressers . They lived at 11 Kepler Street ( or Grove ) , Leeds , at the time of Isidore 's birth . Isodore was the middle of three brothers . The older was Benny ( Bernard ) , born in 1914 , who although extremely clever developed acute mental illness as a young man . He had to leave school in the sixth form having shown great promise and was in and out of institutions much of his life . He died in Hull in the 1970s or 80s . The other brother Montague , seventeen months younger , was slightly physically disabled . He eventually became a medical technician at the Royal Victoria Infirmary at Newcastle -upon - Tyne , married a non - Jewish woman and appears to have lost touch with the family after Joseph and Tilly died . The family moved to Durham in 1922 when Isidore was six years old . An old friend , Dr Nat Cannon ( living in Vancouver aged 94 , in 2007 ) remembers [ that ] the family lived at 6 Cross Street and Isidore 's uncle Isaac Cohen ( Tilly 's brother ) resided at 9 Cross Street . The Durham City Directory for 1913 listed Joseph and Isaac as ' general dealers ' . Both Isidore and Nat attended St Margaret 's Elementary School ( on the honours board at the school , listing the pupils who went on to Grammar School , Isidore 's name was added in 1927 ) and later Johnston 's Grammar School . Isidore attended the Synagogue at 107 Laburnum Avenue of the small Durham community , where his father was a cantor . Isidore was a keen athlete , enjoying cricket , football , swimming and cycling , but was especially interested in learning French . He successfully completed his matriculation , aged sixteen and Higher School Certificate , at eighteen and went up to Armstrong College Newcastle -upon - Tyne , then part of Durham University in 1934 to read French , English and Latin . He and Nat Cannon , studying Medicine , with their slight Geordie accents , met on occasion , although Nat was four years older . As Isidore wrote in his SOE file on the 18th August 1941 : - The exciting life of a young student began for me ; I studied , I played games , I was interested in everything French language , literature and customs was my special study . In June 1936 , at the beginning of the holiday , I decided to go to Belgium with a friend ( I corresponded with a young Belgian student at the time ) . We left over for Ostend , then Brussels . As it was necessary for us to write a thesis for our BA degree , we installed ourselves at the University there - in the ' Cite estugiantine ' in order to use the books in the library . When the thesis was finished , we went to Bruges and to Blankenberghe , then to the French coast for a few days ; finally from Antwerp , we returned to England . In 1937 , I obtained my BA Degree ( 2nd class honours ) and in 1938 , after a year of study , I obtained the DThPT ( Diploma in the Theory and Practice of Teaching ) from Kings College Newcastle . I left the University and settled in Hull as a teacher in a Primary School . Meanwhile , Isidore 's father was bankrupt by 1938 ( though he later became a successful cloth merchant ) and moved with his family to Hull , where he was able to find a poorly paid job . This was as shomer ( literally , ' guard ' or ' keeper ' , who ensures that food sold in the community 's shops and prepared for weddings , bar mitzvahs and other events , is strictly kosher ) . They lived at 62 Etherington Drive then later at 137 Clumber Street , Princess Avenue . Joseph died 10th April 1966 and Tilly died 28th March 1956 . Isidore became engaged in Hull , and was teaching at Middleton Street Boy 's School from September 1938 . ( The school was demolished in 1994 . ) Isidore joined the army on he 29th August 1940 ( 2350538 ) and trained as a radio telegraphist with the Royal Corps of Signals at Catterick for six months . Posted to Scarborough , he then was posted to Kent for four months as a signalman . He was commissioned as a First Lieutenant ( 216306 ) and finished training on July 1941 , moved to Sheffield with the 12th Light Anti Aircraft Regiment . Stationed with a Royal Artillery battery in Hull . On 1st August 1941 , Isidore was sent for Wireless Officer Training with SOE . He broke his leg whilst training in Scotland . Isidore Newman was sent to Wanborough Manor near Guildford , taking on the pseudonym of ' Matthieu Elliot ' to disguise his identity from other recruits . The course instructors soon noticed his less than perfect French - he 'd studied the language at university , but had only spent a couple of weeks on the Continent , travelling across Belgium and northern France - and they also had some concerns over his moodiness during his commando training in Scotland , but there was no question about his technical abilities and he proved himself a determined and dedicated student . On the 9th March 1944 , Newman was arrested by the Gestapo , following the capture of Claude Malraux . As well as these two , a total of some 80 members of the SALESMAN circuit were taken by the Germans . In the same roundup eighteen tons of arms were also seized . At the beginning of September 1944 Newman 's group was transferred to Mauthausen concentration camp , along with three other ' F ' Section inmates , Sidney Jones , Marcus Bloom and Georges Clement . During 6th and 7th September Newman and his group were shot at or near the camp 's quarry , along with 40 agents from SOE 's Dutch section . His full story is told in Captain Isidore Newman SOE , Martin Sugarman , Jewish Historical Studies , 2007 . See also SOE Profiles by Nigel Perrin , for a more detailed history of his operations as an SOE agent . Isidore Newman was awarded a posthumous M.B.E. in 1946 , and is commemorated at the Brookwood Memorial in Surrey , the SOE memorial at Mauthausen and the ' F ' Section memorial at Valen\u00e7ay in France .

You still have access to all of the site 's content , but for the full experience you need to upgrade your browser . Possibly the best information I took away from the biotechnology documentary \u201c The Future of Food \u201d is the location of a great little Mexican restaurant right around the corner from the theater hosting the screening . And let me tell you , if you plan on seeing this film , you will appreciate knowing where to find good Mexican food when it 's over . Mouthwatering shots of tortillas and tacos serve to highlight one of writer \/ director Deborah Koons Garcia 's main concerns about biotech crops : Despite our best efforts , genetically modified ( GM ) plants can spread their genes where they are not welcome . In rural Mexico , considered to be the birthplace of corn , Koons Garcia worries that some protected varieties are being contaminated with transgenic corn from the U.S. , threatening biodiversity . Depending on your perspective , it might not help that her argument is based exclusively on research by a University of California , Berkeley , professor whose paper on the subject was retracted from Nature five months after it appeared in print . But then , how a viewer reacts to the messages in \u201c The Future of Food \u201d will be entirely based on perspective . When the house lights went up , fellow moviegoers either patted each other on the back for buying only organic foods or walked out grumbling accusations of propaganda . Phrases like \u201c preaching to the choir \u201d and \u201c fear-mongering \u201d also rippled through the crowd . In general , Koons Garcia glosses over the science of genetic engineering , instead focusing on the legal ramifications of \u201c patenting life \u201d and whether GM crops have enough federal oversight to protect public health . Simple animations of gel electrolysis and recombinant technology were significantly less memorable than the repeated images of crop dusting and the weepy faces of family farmers caught in a corporate power struggle . In one segment , Koons Garcia chronicles the story of a Canadian farmer whose livelihood was compromised when Monsanto found samples of its patented Roundup Ready canola on his field . Aside from perhaps justifiable allegations of corporate greed , both farmer and filmmaker seem horrified that scientists are tampering with the genes of a popular and economically vital crop like canola . Koons Garcia never mentions that canola \u2014 short for Canadian Oil \u2014 was created in the 1970s when a pair of plant breeders used a scalpel and gas chromatograph to engineer an oilseed rape plant with low levels of erucic acid , a potential culprit in heart disease . The technique was less sophisticated , but the results were the same : a genetically modified version of a common crop . Such oversights , combined with a proliferation of voices from only one side of the fence , ultimately undermine the film 's credibility . The lack of balance is especially frustrating because the film does present several valid concerns about the biotech revolution : Should businesses have the right to patent genes ? Will we be able to control crossbreeding between wild and transgenic plants ? How will people physically react to designer foods , and will we even know when we are eating them ? These concerns are not new , however , and the film adds little information about efforts to address them . Koons Garcia 's proposed solution is that we the people should ban GM crops completely and demand organic farming , which in the end makes \u201c The Future of Food \u201d seem less like a documentary and more like a 91 - minute advertisement . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Role\": [], \"Place\": [\"Canadian\"], \"Time\": [\"in the 1970s\"], \"Agent\": [\"a pair of plant breeders\"], \"Instrument\": [\"a scalpel and gas chromatograph\"], \"Purpose\": [\"to engineer an oilseed rape plant with low levels of erucic acid\"]}"}

For the first time , scientists and engineers had an opportunity to analyze equipment after it being subjected to long - term exposure on the lunar surface . \" The returned material and photographs have been studied and evaluated by 40 teams of engineering and scientific investigators over a period of more than one year , \" wrote Surveyor program manager Benjamin Milwitzky in the 1971 report on the studies ' findings . More than 80 researchers carefully examined the returned Surveyor parts for the effects of radiation and lunar dust exposure . As it turned out , Conrad and Bean had been correct \u2014 Surveyor 3 did change color and it was partly due to lunar dust adhesion . Sun exposure , over the course of 32 lunar days , had also caused paint to fade . Related : How a Passionate Scientist 's Eye Led to the 1st Pinpoint Moon Landing The engineering studies found that the TV camera and other hardware exhibited no signs of failure , which led Milwitzky to conclude , \" that the state of technology , even as it existed [ prior to the Surveyor 3 launch in 1966 ] , is capable of producing reliable hardware that makes feasible long - life lunar and planetary installations . \" Other studies looked at the probe 's equipment for the effects of the solar wind and micrometeorite impacts . About the latter , the research concluded that none of the visible surface features were of meteoritic origin . Bacteria that was found within the television camera was initially thought to have been deposited before Surveyor 3 was launched to the moon , meaning that it had survived for 31 months on the moon . Later studies found that it was more likely to have been the result of contamination from the team inspecting the camera after it was returned to Earth , as a result of poor clean room procedures . Surveyor souvenirs After the studies were complete , NASA placed some of the Surveyor 3 parts into storage , alongside the moon rock and soil samples being preserved by the Lunar Receiving Laboratory ( later , Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility ) at Johnson Space Center in Houston . Others made their way to museums \u2014 and elsewhere . \" NASA treats them as lunar samples , not as artifacts , \" said Michael Neufeld , a senior curator in the space history department at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington , DC . \" We have the Surveyor 3 camera on loan . \" The television camera is currently in storage , as the gallery where it has been exhibited is being renovated . It is expected to return to display with the opening of the new Exploring the Planets exhibition in 2022 . The Cosmosphere space museum in Hutchinson , Kansas exhibits the scoop from the soil sampler , which is also on loan from NASA . Another piece of the sampler is on display at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , California . NASA also loaned or gifted Surveyor 3 parts to some of its leaders . Before arriving at the Smithsonian , the Surveyor 3 camera was presented to William Pickering on his retirement as the director of JPL in 1976 . The sampler scoop 's motor gear box cover was placed with an American flag that was flown on Apollo 12 in a clear tube and mounted on a wooden base for presentation to NASA 's chief scientist John Naugle for his \" many contributions to the nation 's scientific efforts in space . \" After Naugle 's death in 2013 , his family returned the display to NASA 's headquarters in Washington , DC , where it is today . \" When John Naugle 's daughter returned the Surveyor 3 memento to us , it had a sticker on the bottom that said something like , ' To be returned to NASA , ' \" wrote Bill Barry , NASA 's chief historian , in an email to collectSPACE.com . Another piece , the color filter wheel from the television camera , remains in private hands . NASA presented the Surveyor 3 artifact to Edgar Cortright , director of Langley Research Center in Hampton , Virginia , from 1968 to 1975 . After he died in 2014 , Cortright 's son confirmed that NASA considers the filter wheel to be his family 's property , but has plans to eventually share it with the public . \" While I do intend to donate it at some point as I think it belongs at the museum , I decided to hold onto it for a while as a memory of my father , \" said Dave Cortright . That pieces were loaned or gifted as souvenirs is not unheard of , said Neufeld . \" There is some precedent from human [ spaceflight ] missions , people would take things out of the spacecraft and turn them into gifts or the astronauts would take things home , \" he said . \" So there has been this tradition of turning these things into awards for people at NASA . \" That said , both Barry and Neufeld agree that having the Surveyor 3 parts available today , 50 years after they were returned to Earth , has merit . \" There is much to be learned from Surveyor 3 , \" said Barry . \" Studying the Surveyor artifacts currently on Earth again with new techniques could , I presume , bear new information . \" \" [ They are ] something that were on the moon that you can look at , something that was recovered from the moon and is in the spectacular pictures from Apollo 12 of the astronauts at Surveyor , \" said Neufeld . \" You can say , ' That thing in this photo is this object that is sitting right in front of you . \u201d Click through to collect SPACE to see more photos of the Apollo 12 - retrieved parts of the Surveyor 3 probe . - Apollo 12 Was Struck By Lightning Right After Launch ...

Sept. 23 , 2009 -- Former child - star Mackenzie Phillips , whose life has been marred by drug abuse and arrests , confessed today that she engaged in a 10 - year consensual sexual relationship with her father , rock star John Phillips . Phillips , 49 , the former star of ' 70s - ' 80s sitcom \" One Day at a Time , \" told Oprah Winfrey that she was first raped by her father in a hotel room when she was 18 while passed out after a drug binge but continued to use drugs and have consensual sex with him for years . The relationship continued long after she married Jeff Sessler when she was 19 , and ended only when she became pregnant and feared her father was the baby 's father , Phillips said . John Phillips , she said , paid for an abortion . Reading an excerpt from her new book , \" High on Arrival , \" on Winfrey 's show today , Phillips said of her first sexual experience with her father : \" I woke up that night from a blackout to find myself having sex with my father . I do n't know how it started . \" She was raped by her father , lead singer of the Mamas and the Papas , in the hotel room in the late 1970s , Phillips said . \" For a moment , I was in my body for a horrible truth , \" she said of waking up and realizing she had had sex with her father . \" I boxed it away . I started very early on in my life compartmentalizing . ... This was the mother of all difficult experiences . ... I [ have spent ] the last 30 years trying not to look at it , \" she said . Michelle Phillips , Mackenzie Phillips ' stepmother and a member of the ' 60s group the Mamas and the Papas , told the Hollywood Reporter she believed the allegations were false . Phillips said Mackenzie had \" a lot of mental illness \" and that \" she 's had a needle stuck up her arm for 35 years . \" \" Mackenzie is jealous of her siblings , who have accomplished a lot and did not become drug addicts , \" Michelle said . Mackenzie Phillips told Winfrey she confronted her father about the rape , but he characterized their relationship as romantic , Mackenzie said . \" After the first experience , I went to my father and said we need to talk about how you raped me . My dad said : ' Raped you ? Do n't you mean made love ? ' In that moment , I thought I 'm really on my own here . \" In 1980 , soon after she 'd been fired from \" One Day at a Time \" because of her out - of - control drug use , Phillips began to travel with her father 's new band , the New Mamas and the Papas . It was during that time , she said , that she began regularly doing drugs and having sex with her father . \" It did n't happen every day , it did n't happen every week , but it certainly happened and happened many times , \" she said . Mackenzie Phillips Forgave Her Father \" It became a consensual relationship over time . I ca n't believe I 'm the only one this happened to , \" she said . \" No matter what kind of incest , it is an abuse of power ... a betrayal of trust . \" She forgave her father on his deathbed , but his death , in 2001 , relaunched her abuse of drugs , Phillips said . In excerpts from \" High on Arrival \" printed in People magazine , Phillips writes : \" On the eve of my wedding , my father showed up , determined to stop it . I had tons of pills and dad had tons of everything too . Eventually I passed out on Dad 's bed . \" I was a fragment of a person , and my secret isolated me , \" she writes , according to People . \" One night Dad said , ' We could just run away to a country where no one would look down on us . There are countries where this is an accepted practice . Maybe Fiji . ' \" Phillips was supposed to be reunited last year with her former television co-stars on the \" Rachael Ray Show \" but was arrested at Los Angeles International airport for possessing cocaine . Former co-star Valerie Bertinelli learned of Phillip 's incestuous relationship while backstage during the taping of the Winfrey show . \" You 're only as sick as your secrets , \" Bertinelli told her old friend and said she regretted not being there to help Phillips earlier .

U.S. forces have massed ships and helicopters near the disaster areas and devoted their efforts to cargo transportation , search , rescue and recovery work and carrying SDF members to their destinations . These coordinated relief activities at the disaster sites are expected to deepen the Japan - U.S. alliance . Especially noteworthy among the various relief activities are early efforts by the U.S. military to restore the damaged Sendai Airport , one of the most important transportation bases in the devastated region . The airport , directly hit by tsunami , could not be used due to the rubble and wrecked automobiles strewn across its runways . U.S. marines stationed in Okinawa Prefecture arrived there and started to remove the debris . Thanks to their efforts , the airport could resume part of its functions and serve as an emergency landing field for helicopters and other aircraft carrying relief materials . An expert said the action was based on the military principle that troops cannot conduct operations unless materials move first . The U.S. military also was transporting food , water , medicine , blankets , clothes and supplies by helicopters belonging to its fleet , including the USS Ronald Reagan , a nuclear - powered aircraft carrier , in seas off the Sanriku coast . A U.S. Marine Corps amphibious landing ship , the USS Tortuga , transported about 280 members and 94 vehicles of the Ground Self - Defense Force from Tomakomai , Hokkaido , to Ominato , Aomori Prefecture , on Wednesday and Thursday . On Saturday , U.S. forces supported helicopter transportation in seas off Hachinohe , Aomori Prefecture . U.S. marines based in Okinawa Prefecture have also participated in relief activities . Three U.S. naval vessels , including the amphibious assault ship USS Essex with 2,200 members of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard , are involved in relief activities in the Sea of Japan off Akita Prefecture . The troops use Yamagata Airport as a base for transporting fuel and materials to the disaster areas . This is the first time that the U.S. military has used a private airport in Japan for anything other than emergency landings , according to a senior member of the Defense Ministry . Sources close to the ministry commented that deployment of U.S. forces around Japan might be similar if a contingency were to occur on the Korean Peninsula . The U.S. military is also helping Japan deal with the reactor accidents at the Fukushima nuclear power plant . They have loaned 100 sets of nuclear protective gear to members of the SDF and other organizations involved . However , the U.S. Defense Department announced that it has prohibited U.S. soldiers from coming within 50 miles ( about 80 kilometers ) of the Fukushima nuclear power plant . The announcement reflects the apparent seriousness with which the U.S. government views the situation of the stricken reactors . Meanwhile , Adm . Robert Willard , commander of the U.S. Pacific Command , was planning to leave the United States for Japan on Saturday . In Japan , he will meet Gen. Ryoichi Oriki , chief of staff of the Self - Defense Force 's Joint Staff . Sources close to the Japanese government said Willard 's visit to Japan \" shows a strong sense of crisis on the side of the U.S. government . \" ( Mar. 20 , 2011 ) The Daily Yomiuri , The Yomiuri Shimbun Topics Media Data Info Link WASEDA ONLINE Chuo Online Mobile Phone | Web Site Policies | About Us| Privacy Policy | Copyright | Linking Policy | Contact Us| | \u00a9 The Yomiuri Shimbun . <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Salient_entity\": [], \"Agent\": [\"the amphibious assault ship USS Essex with 2,200 members of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard\"], \"Goal\": [\"relief\"], \"Place\": [\"in the Sea of Japan off Akita Prefecture\"], \"Time\": [\"Mar. 20 , 2011\"]}"}

The level of detail was described by Tripwire 's president John Gibson as \" rivaling or exceeding tank simulation games . \" <\/report_document>\n    <source_document> Red Orchestra : Heroes of Stalingrad : Vehicles To anyone who swore and panicked their way through the original Red Orchestra modification back in 2004 , or its commercial release , Red Orchestra : Ostfront , back in 2006 , the upcoming sequel Red Orchestra : Heroes of Stalingrad should represent a big deal . To anyone with no idea what Red Orchestra is , let me help out : It 's a multiplayer FPS , set on the Eastern front of World War 2 , which captures above all else the grayness and desperation of those nightmare battlefields . Red Orchestra is a game of wincing at suppressive fire , of bayonet attacks , and of struggling to figure out whether that figure is a German or a Russian because muddy gray and muddy brown often look the same in dim lighting . The sequel 's looking to expand on everything that made the original game great , including its horrific tank combat . Here , we present an exclusive interview with Tripwire President John Gibson , in which he talks freely on the as-of - yesterday unrevealed vehicle combat coming in the sequel . RPS : You mentioned that you plan to set the standard of tank combat in FPS games for years to come . How , exactly ? John Gibson : The big thing we 're doing with tanking for ROHOS is to really immerse the player in what it was like to be an actual soldier inside of one of these lumbering beasts in World War 2 . The typical FPS tanking experience generally has the player viewing the tank from third person , and the player essentially feels like they ARE the tank rather than feeling like they are a person in a tank . For ROHOS our goal is to move beyond that and provide the player with an immersive and robust first person experience . For starters we have fully modeled the entire interior of every tank in the game . At any position in the tank the player will see what a real person in the tank would see . Look down and you 'll see your hands operating all of the levers . Move between positions and it will be fully animated in first person . And your tank will have a full crew of either AI NPC 's or human players to fight alongside you . Look to your right and you will see the hull machine gunner blasting away at the enemy . Fire the main cannon , and you 'll see an NPC crewman reloading the cannon shell beside you . You have a living breathing crew all around you and you can see all of the elements of the tank operating . When a shell penetrates your armor , you 'll see your crewmates die around you , and hear their screams as the tank catches fire . Beyond this we have added a whole new level of functionality and interaction to the tanks . The first thing that we 've done is what we call a virtual interior . The player can actually look around in the interior and very easily interact with the interior . Want to look out of a view slit , just look at the slit and press a button . Want to stick your head out of the hatch , look up and press a button . It is all very streamlined and allows the player to do a lot of things but very simply . We 're actual giving players very near to a tank simulation 's level of functionality , but streamlined so it is easy to use and accessible . Speaking of view , one of the things we discovered after we shipped the original Red Orchestra was that while the view inside a tank is somewhat limited , there are a LOT of view ports , view slits , and periscopes that the tank crew had at their disposal to get a better view of what is happening outside of the tank . So for ROHOS we have added the ability to very easily interact with any of these and get a better view of the situation . Another area which we 've greatly expanded on is the damage system . The original RO had a generalized damage system with just a few key damageable components . For ROHOS we 've expanded this to include a very broad range of damageable components with accompanying gameplay effects . Things such as damaging optics , damaging the engine and transmission , damaging the turret rotation mechanism , hitting the fuel tank , drive sprocket , treads and more are now included . And now shots that penetrate the tank armor can hit the crewmembers inside . RPS : Can you repair tank damage ? And what amount of damage can be repaired ? JG : We are actually a bit torn on repairing damage on the tanks . Realistically there are n't a lot of repairs that you could do to a tank within the time frame of a match in ROHOS . But not allowing repairs leads to unrealistic gameplay where everyone always fights to the death , instead of retreating for repairs when they are too damaged to continue fighting . We 're looking at the idea of allowing tanks to be repaired at the resupply areas . This is something we 're still prototyping and trying different things , so we 'll have to wait and see what the final system ends up being . RPS : Will we see any playable vehicles other than tanks ? JG : For the initial release we 're going to ship with two medium tanks \u2013 the T34 76 and the Panzer IV . I know that might not seem like a lot , but for ROHOS our goal with the vehicles was to focus on quality over quantity . In tank simulations you typically only see a couple of drivable tank in the game . This is due to the sheer amount of work required to implement a vehicle at that level of detail . And for ROHOS , we 're actually implemented tanks at a level of detail and functionality far beyond tank sims or any existing game . Tripwire has a philosophy though when it comes to releasing games . We like to give gamers a lot of value for their money when they buy a game from us at launch , but they can also count on getting even more out of their game in the form of free content packs . We 've put out a LOT of free additional content for the original Red Orchestra as well as Killing Floor . So we do already have four additional vehicles in production and those will likely come out in our first free content pack not long after the launch . The four additional vehicles will be two more tanks and two troop transports . RPS : Awesome as they were , in the past I 've found tanks in RO can be a source of frustration - either getting slaughtered by them as a fleshy little infantryman , or finding yourself inside one with a crew that does n't know what they 're doing . Were you planning to address either of these situations ? JG : A lot of our work for ROHOS for both tanks and infantry has been to make a game that stays true to its realism roots while also being much more accessible than the original game . Infantry versus tanks is a tricky thing to balance in a game that aims to be both realistic and accessible , because tanks really should do very well against infantry . For us one of the things we learned during and after the release of RO : Ostfront was that making good combined arms gameplay is about putting tanks in situations where they are vulnerable to infantry . We found that in the right setting , tanks can be at a serious disadvantage to infantry . In the first game we put infantry in a lot of scenarios fighting tanks in their element \u2013 wide open landscapes fighting infantry . These scenarios end up with happy tankers and unhappy infantrymen . So we 've taken what we 've learned from the first game and applied that to the levels in ROHOS . Now when we do combined arms levels , we make sure that there is plenty of cover and concealment so that the infantry can more easily get the drop on the tanks . We 've also given the infantry some additional tools for their tank fighting arsenal in the form of semi-automatic anti tank rifles , and anti tank grenades . Regarding making tanks less frustrating , let me just say \u2013 we hear you . Tanking in RO : Ostfront at its best was an amazing experience you could n't get anywhere else , but at its worst could be an exercise in frustration . The biggest issue we found was that tanking with other random public players was extremely frustrating , especially if they did n't know what they were doing or were n't using their microphone . To address this we 've made a lot of changes for ROHOS . First off , players will never have to tank with some one that they do n't want to . When a player chooses a tank role they have the option of locking the tank , or allowing other people to join their crew . Another frustrating thing was standing around waiting for a tank to spawn . Tankers now always spawn inside their tank , and respawn with their tank . Additionally every level will feature enough tanks so that every tanker will have a tank . Since tanking with random public players was frustrating in the first game players usually ended up tanking by themselves . Because the tanks in the game were designed to be crewed by three people , tanking by yourself was cumbersome requiring the player to constantly switch between positions . This was neither realistic nor fun , as a tank would never leave base in a real battle with just one tank crewman . So to address this the big feature we 're adding that I 've touched on a little bit already is the AI crew . When you choose to tank by yourself you will now have a fully functional intelligent AI crew at your disposal . You can choose to play any of the main positions in the tank still , but now the AI will handle the rest for you . If you just want to drive around , the AI crew will man the MGs and take out infantry for you , or fire the main cannon at enemy tanks . If you want to operate the main cannon , you can use your movement keys to easily give orders to the driver to move the tank . If commanding is your thing , you can take the command position and designate targets for the AI crew to attack , give locational movement orders to the tank driver using a 3d command widget or the overhead map , give normal movement commands using the movement keys , spot artillery targets with your binoculars , and more . And with a full live AI crew the player can instantly switch between any of these positions assuming the role of that AI crewmember , and the AI will dynamically take over the functionality in the position you just left . Now there is a catch . If an AI crewmember is killed the player will need to move to the position of the dead crewmember to perform the function of that crewmember . And transitions to the position of a dead crewmember will be a real first person animated transition that will take time . The good news is , if you lose a crew member you can go to a vehicle resupply station and get your tank reinforced with fresh crewmembers . And the player can mix and match other human players with the AI crew members . There are a lot of other things we 've done to refine tanking and make it more accessible . In the first game people found the in tank view very limiting , either because they did n't understand that you could zoom in on the view slits or open the hatches , or because we did n't provide all of the views that the real tank actually had . So for the new game we will have a training mission that will familiarize the player with the tank functionality , including the use of the view system so they do n't get in the battlefield and think the only view <\/source_document>\n    "}],"gold_roles":"{\"Salient_entity\": [], \"Time\": [], \"Place\": [], \"Post\": [\"your tank\"], \"Agent\": [\"a full crew of either AI NPC 's or human players\"]}"}
