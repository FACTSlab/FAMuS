But some politicians and newspapers have complained that the government is too weighted in favour of allies of President Joseph Kabila . The government faces a country ravaged by years of misrule and conflict . Some critics say there are not enough representatives from western Congo , apart from Mr Gizenga and Nzanga Mobutu , son of former ruler Mobutu Sese Seko . Electoral support for Mr Kabila was greatest in the east of the country while most westerners voted for former rebel leader Jean - Pierre Bemba and his MLC party . Big team The BBC 's Arnaud Zajtman in the capital , Kinshasa , says newspapers sold well , as people rushed to find out who was in the new team . \" People have been waiting for this for a long time . It 's a good day for Congo . We expect them to work like they should , \" a newspaper vendor said . After weeks of delay in announcing the new administration , it comprises a small team of six state ministers and a larger cabinet of 54 ministers and vice-ministers . | || | DR CONGO GOVERNMENT Antoine Gizenga - PM Nzanga Mobutu - agriculture Denis Kalume - interior Mbusa Nyamwisi - foreign affairs No-one from former rebel groups , RCD or MLC Under a 2002 deal to end the five - year DR Congo conflict , a power - sharing government , including the former rebel leaders , was set up . But Mr Kabila 's supporters argued that his election victory gave him and his allies a mandate to govern alone . Mr Gizenga , 81 , promised to support Mr Kabila 's bid for the presidency after he came third in the first round of presidential election in July . He was a deputy prime minister in the government of the country 's first post-independence leader , Patrice Lumumba .

General information about the 2023 Review Following the passing of the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020 in December 2020 , and the publication of the relevant Parliamentary electorate data in January 2021 , we began a new review of all Parliamentary constituencies in England . We refer to this as the ' 2023 Review ' , as we are required to report with our final recommendations by 1 July 2023 . Applying the statutory formula to the electorate figures means the total 650 constituencies is distributed during the review to the four parts of the UK as follows : - England = 543 ( includes two ' protected ' constituencies on the Isle of Wight ) ; - Scotland = 57 ( includes two ' protected ' constituencies for specified Scottish islands ) ; - Wales = 32 ( includes one ' protected ' constituency on the Isle of Anglesey ) ; and - Northern Ireland = 18 This Commission has applied the same distribution formula to the English allocation , which results in the following redistribution of constituencies among the nine English regions for the 2023 Review : - East Midlands = 47 ( increase of one ) - Eastern = 61 ( increase of three ) - London = 75 ( increase of two ) - North East = 27 ( decrease of two ) - North West = 73 ( decrease of two ) - South East = 91 ( increase of seven ) - South West = 58 ( increase of three ) - West Midlands = 57 ( decrease of two ) - Yorkshire and the Humber = 54 ( no change ) Application of further statutory rules to the published electorate also means that all recommended constituencies must have no less than 69,724 Parliamentary electors and no more than 77,062 ( except those ' protected ' constituencies mentioned above ) . By law , these electorate figures relate to the electorates as they were on 2 March 2020 . What happens now ? The secondary consultation on our suggested new constituency boundaries closed on 4 April 2022 . The Commission is now analysing all the responses submitted during the first and secondary consultation stages . We will produce a report deciding whether our proposals should change based on the feedback we received . If our proposals change , we will hold a further four - week written consultation on our revised proposals later this year . Are you using the ward - level data published by ONS in January 2021 ? Mostly . The ONS publication reflects wards as they were at the time of the data collection , but December 2020 legislation introduced the concept of our work having regard to ' prospective ' local government boundaries , i.e. wards that have been ' made ' by legal instrument , but not yet implemented at a subsequent local election . Nearly 10 % of local authorities in England ( mostly in London ) have such ' prospective ' ward boundaries , specifically : 1 ) Barnet ; 2 ) Basingstoke and Deane ; 3 ) Brent ; 4 ) Buckinghamshire ; 5 ) Cambridge ; 6 ) Camden ; 7 ) Chorley ; 8 ) Cornwall ; 9 ) Ealing ; 10 ) Enfield ; 11 ) Halton ; 12 ) Hammersmith and Fulham ; 13 ) Haringey ; 14 ) Harrow ; 15 ) Hartlepool ; 16 ) Hillingdon ; 17 ) Hounslow ; 18 ) Isle of Wight ; 19 ) Islington ; 20 ) Lewisham ; 21 ) Merton ; 22 ) North Northamptonshire ; 23 ) Oxford ; 24 ) Pendle ; 25 ) Richmond upon Thames ; 26 ) Rotherham ; 27 ) Salford ; 28 ) Sutton ; 29 ) West Northamptonshire ; 30 ) Westminster ; 31 ) Wiltshire . We have worked with the Electoral Registration Officers for all these local authorities , to recast the ONS data according to the prospective wards , and you can download the complete ward - level dataset for the review from the 2023 Review section of our Data and Resources page . What will be your process and policies for the 2023 Review ? Our initial outline timetable is planned as follows : - 5 Jan 2021 : Publication of headline electorate figures by ONS , BCE begin development of initial proposals ; - 24 March 2021 : Publish complete ward - level electorate figures ( i.e. including ' prospective ' wards ) ; - 10 May 2021 : Publish ' Guide to the 2023 Review ' ; - 8 June 2021 : Publish initial proposals and conduct eight - week written consultation ; - Early 2022 : Publish responses to initial proposals and conduct six -week ' secondary consultation ' , including between two and five public hearings in each region ; - Late 2022 : Publish revised proposals and conduct four - week written consultation ; - June 2023 : Submit and publish final report and recommendations . You can read more about the process , law and policies we work to in the review in our Guide to the 2023 Review . We have created a partner pack , which includes our press release , blog , copy and graphics for your website or social media channels , an FAQ and more to help you publicise the 2023 Boundary Review .

In the former poem the speaker 's love for her beloved has somehow caused their relatives ' blood to be shed , and accordingly , as the title of the poem indicates , the speaker has chosen to expiate her guilt by entering a convent . In her monologue she urges her beloved to do likewise : to turn away from the evanescent pleasures of this life and to repent his sins , thereby ensuring that the two of them can reunite in heaven if not on earth . She emphasizes that if he fails to repent and thus suffers spiritual death , her own afterlife reward will suffer as a result : How shall I rest in Paradise , Or sit on steps of heaven alone If Saints and Angels spoke of love Should I not answer from my throne : Have pity upon me , ye my friends , For I have heard the sound thereof : Should I not turn with yearning eyes , Turn earthwards with a pitiful pang ? Oh save me from a pang in heaven . The speaker imagines herself in the same predicament as the blessed damozel : in heaven , but unable to enjoy it in the absence of her beloved . Dante Gabriel Rossetti 's poem presented this situation from the viewpoint of the earthbound male beloved , who apparently imagined this vision in order to congratulate himself on how much the damozel loved him . By contrast , Christina Rossetti adopts the perspective of the female lover , who conjures up a similar hypothetical situation for a seemingly more altruistic purpose . In adopting the woman 's perspective Christina Rossetti avoids the trap of objectifying the beloved , as her brother 's poem had done . Furthermore , she permits he man to control his own destiny . Her speaker urges the beloved to repent and earn entry into heaven , suggesting that he can choose whether or not to do so . On the other hand , Dante Gabriel Rossetti presented the damozel as praying that God would allow the speaker into heaven , thus taking the choice of the speaker 's afterlife destination out of his own hands . Questions 1 . Does it make sense to read \" The Convent Threshold \" as a feminist version of \" The Blessed Damozel , \" assuming that one poem directly influenced the other ? Or do both poems feature the same type of male chauvinism ? 2 . This poem 's description of heaven focuses on its sensual beauty and its associated pleasures : \" Beyond the gulf a gleaming strand \/ Of meansions where the righteous sup ; \/ Who sleep at ease among their trees . \" This view of heaven seems similar to the \" gold bar \" of heaven as described in \" The Blessed Damozel . \" Would Christina Rossetti 's contemporaries have criticized her conception of heaven as overly materialistic ? 3 . As we discussed in class , Anglican convents were a relatively new phenomenon at the time of this poem , and some scholars believe that the act of entering a convent had feminist implications . Should we read the speaker 's decision to enter a convent in this way ? 4 . In lines 85 - 109 the speaker narrates a dream she has had , which she takes to signify that \" Knowledge is strong , but love is sweet ; [...] All is small \/ Save love , for love is all in all . \" How does this dream function in the overall scheme of the poem ? What connection does it have to contemporary debates over science and religion ? Last modified 20 October 2003"},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

WINSTON TIMES-DISPATCH STAFF Republished from 1998 profiles The reaper , which revolutionized agriculture in America , was invented in the early 1800s on the McCormick plantation in Rockbridge County . Robert McCormick has been credited with involvement in the reaper 's creation . His son , Cyrus , later received the patent on the reaper and went on to mass produce it at what was to become International Harvester Co. in Chicago . People are also reading \u2026 But little has been said about Jo Anderson , a slave on the McCormick family plantation , whom McCormick descendants and some historians acknowledge as a major contributor to the design and creation of the reaper . Jo Anderson \" has as much to do with the later development of the reaper as Cyrus McCormick , \" said Lester R. Godwin Jr. , retired curator of the McCormick Farm in Augusta and Rockbridge counties . \" Unfortunately , history likes to put things in neat boxes . . . and often those who are involved in the creation of something do n't get credit for it . \" Because of the nature of slavery , historians and researchers have found the contributions of slaves to particular inventions difficult to trace . Much of their work is unacknowledged . However , in his 1931 book , \" The Century of the Reaper , \" Cyrus ' grandson , Cyrus McCormick , gave Anderson credit . Cyrus McCormick Farm Blacks in Science and Medicine Vivian Ovelton Sammons The Century of the Reaper Cyrus McCormick Of that day in July 1831 , when the reaper was first tested before an audience of friends , neighbors and skeptics in the Shenandoah Valley , McCormick 's grandson wrote : \" Jo Anderson was there , the Negro slave who , through the crowded hours of recent weeks , had helped build the reaper . \" . . . Jo Anderson deserves honor as the man who worked beside him in the building of the reaper . Jo Anderson was a slave , a general farm laborer and a friend . . . and the Negro toiled with him up to the hour of the test and after . \" According to some accounts , Anderson and McCormick were more like brothers than slave and master . Anderson was born in 1808 to Charles and Eunice Anderson at Walnut Grove , the McCormick plantation . Cyrus was born a year later and Robert McCormick gave Anderson to him . The two grew up together and worked together at Walnut Grove . Jo Anderson 1808 1809 1831 1834 1883 1884 No information on Anderson after this year According to Godwin and Hartman , Robert McCormick made a crude first reaper and used it with spotty success about 1809 . Later , Cyrus and Anderson worked on it , perfecting the reaper for that first public test . As the horse - led machine cut a wide path through the field of grain , Anderson walked alongside , raking the sheared stalks of grain off the reaper 's platform onto the ground . The patent was issued in 1834 . Ten years later the reaper still had n't caught on . Cyrus moved to Chicago in 1846 , setting up a factory for the reaper 's manufacture . Anderson 's recollections , recorded in 1888 , indicate that he was freed by Cyrus before the Civil War but could n't live free in Virginia . Instead , he remained at Walnut Grove and was hired out to neighbors , who paid McCormick $ 60 to $ 70 per year . McCormick reportedly returned a portion of that to Anderson . Family records show that McCormick purchased a log cabin on a small plot for Anderson in his later years and that McCormick and his son supported Anderson until his death sometime after 1888 . The exact date is not recorded .

Two years ago it looked unlikely that he would have a pro career , or even much of a future at all . In September 2003 he crashed in the Giro della Toskana and injured himself so badly that he was placed in an induced coma . \" I do n't think about it very often , \" said the 22- year -old . \" Now , I just look to the future . \" Tough route unveiled for FBD Insurance R\ufffds By Shane Stokes The route | | As time continues to tick down to the start of the 2006 FBD Insurance R\ufffdS , more details about the Irish tour have been released . This year\ufffds event will start and finish in Dublin , the riders scrapping it out over a route 1230 kilometres in length and based in the south , west and east of the country . \ufffd I think this is going to be a very tough course due to the balance struck between climbs and long stages , \ufffd said race organiser Dermot Dignam on Thursday . \ufffd There is a lot of pulling and dragging along the way . In addition , the inclusion of a team time trial plus a full road race stage on the final day add additional challenges to the riders . It all should lead to some very exciting racing . \ufffd The 2.2 ranked contest gets underway on Sunday , May 21 with a mainly flat stage from Dublin to Enniscorthy . This 121 kilometre leg will take in two category three climbs along the way but , perhaps more importantly , will also feature two hot spot sprints . These often play an important role in determining the first yellow jersey of the race . At 180 kilometres the second stage from Enniscorthy to Cobh is the longest of the 2006 FBD Insurance R\ufffdS . It features three categorised climbs along the way before a steep uphill sprint to the line . Another uphill finish features 24 hours later in An Daingean ( Dingle ) . However , before reaching the end of the 173 kilometre leg , the peloton will slug it out over four category three ascents earlier in the day . The last of these , An Bharog Bheag , is situated just 13 kilometres from the finish in An Daingean\ufffds Main Street , providing a possible springboard for a stage - winning attack . The route will also pass the house of past winner Pa\ufffddi Fitzgerald , marking the 50th anniversary of his victory . On paper at least , the fourth stage is likely to be the toughest day in the saddle for the estimated 180 participants . The tough roads of Kerry bring a total of seven categorised climbs , the 150 kilometre leg from An Daingean to Listowel including the gruelling category one climb of The Maum . Both long and steep , this is followed by some very undulating roads and should see the peloton split into several distinct groups . Following a ferry transfer from Kerry to Clare , things flatten out somewhat on the following day\ufffds stage from Kilrush to the Gaeltacht ( Irish speaking ) village of An Cheathru Rua . Just one categorised climb will be tackled , but the 178 kilometre leg should bring some fast furious racing . The run - in to the finish will be held mainly on narrow , uneven roads , and so breakaway groups may well have a chance to stay clear to the line . As previously announced , history will be made on Friday 26 May when , for the first time ever , a visually spectacular team time trial will impact upon the general classification of the race . The teams will slug it out on a 24 kilometre course which both starts and finishes in An Cheathru Rua . Later that day the riders will leave the town in a 83 kilometre stage to Westport , taking in two third - category climbs along the way . The ability to recover from the morning time trial will pay a part in determining the outcome of this leg of the race and , indeed , may also impact on the fight for the yellow jersey . Saturday May 27 is the penultimate stage of the 2006 FBD Insurance R\ufffdS and so the stakes will be high . Although there are no categorised climbs along the 168 kilometre route from Westport to Clara , the inevitable clash between the race favourites should result in some fast , tactical racing as the peloton speeds through towns such as Claremorris , Castlerea , and Roscommon . Twenty - four hours later the field will slug it out for the final time as the race reaches its climax with another tough stage . In a break with tradition , the last day will be a fully - fledged road stage rather than a circuit race , increasing the tension in the tussle for the final yellow jersey . The riders will face a total of four categorised climbs between the start in Clara and the finish in Skerries , including one on each of the two laps of a tough 13.7 kilometre finishing circuit .

One of the popular trends today is the use of caffeinated soap . According to proponents of the product , caffeinated soap is a great way to get a boost in the morning when there is no time for morning coffee . However , there is some doubt about the effectiveness of caffeine in soap , at least as a means of getting a lift in the morning . The basic idea behind soap with a healthy dose of caffeine is that people who tend to be sluggish in the morning can achieve a boost with the use of the product . This is accomplished by absorbing caffeine through the skin during the morning shower . Many brands claim to offer two hundred milligrams of caffeine per use , offering just the right amount to help get the morning in progress . While there are a lot of testimonials regarding the effectiveness of caffeinated soap , there are a number of detractors that claim the product is more hype and less effect . Some point out that there are not at present any reliable scientific experiments conducted in controlled conditions to prove the claims made for caffeinated soap . Also , some users report that the morning boost they receive could be from the heavy peppermint scent that is included as part of the ingredients in many popular brands of the product . There is also some concern that even if it is possible to absorb caffeine through the skin , chances are that caffeinated soap is not capable of offering as much of a dose as claimed . Given the fact that the water would dilute the soap very quickly , even if a thick lather were applied to the body before rinsing , there would not be much chance of absorbing more than one to two milligrams at best . Generally , this is understood to not be sufficient to cause much of a jump start first thing in the morning . While there is no doubt that caffeinated soap can cleanse the body , it is doubtful that the product actually provides much in the way of augmenting or substituting for a cup of coffee . However , the power of suggestion , combined with the strong aroma of peppermint , may be sufficient to make waking up in the morning a little easier . Readers Also Love Discussion Comments Did that person just say a caffeine enema ? Am I the only one that saw that ? Who shoots coffee up their rear in the morning for a \" lift \" . read in several health magazines that caffeine would be very good and fast absorbed through the skin , and it is good against cellulite and works good as fat reducer , but for the real caffeine kickstarter for the day , i think a mug of coffee does a better job . I 'm not entirely sure if I subscribe to the idea that caffeinated soap would wake you up in the morning , unless you eat the soap . However , many cellulite - fighting products contain caffeine as a main ingredient . It helps stimulate circulation . There 's an old stripper trick of using old coffee grounds in a wrap around your thighs and bum , purely for the caffeine . Maybe they 're marketing this wrong ... The caffeinated soap may not offer much caffeine \" pickup \" from absorption through the skin in the morning shower , but does the caffeine from coffee -- used in an morning enema -- give the desired \" pickup , \" or is it just an ordinary , health -additive , kind of thing ?"},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Just get him started . Passionate about it , he will not stop talking about C4E until there is no oxygen left with which to build his next breath . C4E , a digital library of radiant photos and stories of couples - gay and straight - celebrating their love and championing equality , is his baby . In short , it would not be inaccurate to describe this baby as a reflection of the wonderful love and life to be had after a person learns the \" itgetsbetter.org \" message of Dan Savage . Chip has been a Miami resident for six years and an accomplished LGBT activist locally and nationally since his 2003 win on television 's The Amazing Race 4 made him famous and gave him a strong platform for living . While other men might have used that platform and the blessing of exceptionally good looks to model underwear , Chip , who is a product of both Yale and Harvard , aimed higher . Even an abbreviated list of his past and present involvements is lengthy and includes The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force , Care Resource , Dining Out For Life , Gay American Heroes Foundation , AIDS Walk Miami , GLAAD , Lambda Legal , HRC , 2008 Electoral College and The Hetrick - Martin Institute . Chip is a business consultant by profession , and in describing the newly launched C4E , he emphasized its careful positioning . \" I 'm an entrepreneur who likes to start a business on the back of a napkin . All the same , I do support existing LGBT programs . For me , C4E is like building a different mousetrap , not necessarily a better mousetrap . We took a long time to set this up before launching it on April 16th . Our site will work in partnership with all other LGBT advocacy groups . C4E is additive , not competitive . We 've come up with a wonderfully simplistic tag line ' Love Above All ' and the goal is to create water cooler chat among people who might not be part of the LGBT conversation . If a straight person says to a friend ' You should check out the photo I posted on C4E ' , we get one step closer to equality because , as everyone knows , a picture is worth a thousand words . \" Arndt is pleasantly surprised by the instantaneous growth of C4E . He had thought that he would have to \" seed \" interest in the site by asking coupled friends to post photos . Instead , he reports the opposite . \" I have no clue who 75 % of the couples who have posted photos are ! Also , 50 % of the couples are straight , and of the LGBT couples , there is an even split between men and women . Because diversity and inclusion are our major goals , these results are great . Maybe the fact that two of the four co-founders are straight had something to do with that . \" In constructing C4E , Arndt took hard questions from LGBT activist - friends who asked him to define the site 's \" call to action \" . He explains it in terms of a recent visit with a friend to an art museum where they inspected a Picasso . He says , \" That painting did not come with instructions . Later over coffee , most of what I got from the painting was entirely different from what my friend got . It is the same with a photo of two people in love . C4E is not going to tell you what it should mean . I am heartened by the number of people who say ' Chip , I get it . ' I felt gratified when a young lesbian couple came up to me at Pride and thanked me for C4E . They had been pressured to live according to rules that were bad for them , and C4E gave them a chance to proclaim their own unique love . That is exactly what I hoped for . When you look at the array of photos on C4E , you are reminded that for many thousands of years , loving couples have come together to build lives that are original , and beautiful because of it . \" Arndt 's ability to move hearts and minds goes beyond his business expertise . His gay life has not been lived from the sidelines . He worked with Larry Kramer when ACT - UP was fresh . He lived through the Reagan years of AIDS ignorance and held the hands of five friends who died because of it . His stories of coming out publically , privately and professionally seem always to have been inadvertently lived on the grand scale . While working on Wall Street as an investment banker , his employer , Morgan Stanley , transferred him to Hong Kong for two years . Closet be damned , he swapped the first class ticket the company gave him for two coach tickets and brought his boyfriend with him . When his life story is made into a movie , only the eye candy du jour should audition for the roles of his gorgeous and famous ex-lovers and boyfriends . Like all good business consultants , Arndt has a long range plan made clear on the C4E website : \" Going forward , Couples for Equality \u2122 will syndicate its materials and gallery , partnering with organizations and not-for-profits which advocate similar values in an effort to educate people on the importance of supporting diverse relationships without judgment or legal obstacles . \" He emphasizes the fact that changing hearts and minds is not only about legislation . Just as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has not yet eliminated discrimination , the eventual repeal of DOMA , DADT and other oppressions will not end our need to see the many faces of love . I thoroughly enjoyed shuffling through the C4E photos and am proud that my husband and I are among the first few hundred couples featured . So far , 9 countries and 22 states are represented . Also , if you are single and therefore not about to post a couples shot , the yenta in me would like you to know that the handsome Chip Arndt is also single . I 'm just saying .

Imagine if , instead of mutating into butt-rock , the post-grunge sound that ruled alternative radio in the late ' 90s had swerved back toward the killer hooks and crushing choruses of Nevermind . Imagine if you did n't even have to envision such superior timelines because some kids from Scotland brought them all to pass at once . Twenty years ago this weekend , Idlewild released 100 Broken Windows in the United States . It rules . It 's so good . Have you heard it ? You need to hear it . Do you already know and love it ? Treat yourself by listening again . Maybe if they 'd had more expensive haircuts or a more intriguing narrative or whatever , Roddy Woomble and the gang would have been as big as the Strokes . Maybe their singer needed a flashier name than Roddy Woomble , which sounds like less like a rock star than a workmanlike midfielder who comes off the bench for Celtic . Thanks to the rightful hype storm surrounding this album , they did become stars in Britain \u2014 where the album had been out for a month by the time it arrived in the States \u2014 and they 're certified legends in their native Scotland . In 2009 , readers of culture newspaper The Skinny even voted 100 Broken Windows Scotland 's album of the decade above classics from Frightened Rabbit , Boards Of Canada , Franz Ferdinand , Primal Scream , Camera Obscura , and other heavy hitters . Meanwhile here in the US they had to settle for rave reviews , MTV2 rotation , and the undying love of a modest following . Idlewild formed in Edinburgh in 1995 and quickly built buzz with their raucous live shows , a chaos documented on their scrappy 1998 debut Hope Is Important . Back then , NME famously compared them to \u201c a flight of stairs falling down a flight of stairs \u201d and \u201c what Fugazi would sound like if they ate meat . \u201d Woomble 's gifts for melody and poetic imagery were already on display \u2014 Idlewild just often obscured them with breakneck tempos , snotty vocal delivery , and squalls of noise . The potential was clear , but the songwriting was n't there yet . They had n't mastered dynamics or figured out how to explore a range of styles while maintaining a coherent identity . Soon enough , though , they 'd be soaring . When they returned with 100 Broken Windows in 2000 , critics were uniformly shocked by how much Idlewild had tamed their rangier impulses . \u201c No more screeching , \u201d wrote Pitchfork . \u201c No more punk-guitar chaos . No more uncomfortable strain . \u201d This was n't entirely true \u2014 \u201c Idea Track , \u201d anyone ? \u2014 but there might have been a lot more of all that had the band stuck with Shellac 's Bob Weston , who tracked the initial sessions for the album before Dave Eringa came into the picture . Idlewild 's new material did not lend itself to the Weston -Albini school of visceral minimalism the way their earliest work had . Like U2 in the early ' 80s , these punks were now writing compact anthems that demanded a certain level of polish and grace . They needed to maintain their gritty immediacy while also sounding shot through with a larger - than - life grandeur . Speaking to The Skinny years later , Woomble reflected , \u201c 100 Broken Windows was very much , for me , us still getting somewhere , still finding our feet . I suppose that 's maybe the best era of any band , when they 've gone beyond their debut but they have n't quite got to the peak of their popularity yet ; where they 're somewhere in between . It 's quite a pure area is n't it ? \u201d In Idlewild 's case it resulted in a fleet of near- flawless pop-rock songs that sped along like sturdy sedans with surprisingly powerful motors , their sparkling paint jobs speckled with bits of sludge . These nifty little machines became vehicles for Woomble 's evocative turns of phrase , opaque poetry blown out into sing - along hooks in that grand alternative rock tradition . \u201c I started becoming interested in using the microphone like a Super - 8 camera to capture little snippets of things , \u201d he told The Skinny . \u201c I knew I was never going to be like Leonard Cohen , but I had my own observations . \u201d These observations were always vivid , if sometimes inscrutable . What did it mean that Woomble needed \u201c A Little Discourage \u201d ? Was \u201c These Wooden Ideas \u201d critiquing postmodernism or celebrating it ? Exactly what stance was \u201c Roseability \u201d taking on Gertrude Stein ? Parsing the meaning of these songs sometimes required deep thought , but enjoying them required no effort at all . Idlewild were flexing a newly discovered verse-chorus - verse mastery , song after song seizing listeners ' attention early on and building momentum to an explosively catchy refrain . Snapping , jangling guitar riffs combusted into power chord infernos . The drums boomed and thwacked with such force you could feel it in your chest . Woomble could still shred his throat when the situation called for it , but his nasally hooks were becoming strong enough to turn lines like \u201c Why ca n't you be more cynical ? \u201d into life - affirming refrains . These were not voice - of - a- generation landmarks , at least not here in America . But they were the kind of infectious guitar bangers that stick with you for life , and they added up to one of those underrated gems that become part of a person 's private canon . They do n't make 'em like this anymore \u2014 neither the universal \u201c they \u201d nor Idlewild themselves . The band progressed further into radio-friendly compression on 2002 's good - not - great The Remote Part , a more commercially successful effort that has since become overshadowed by the legend of 100 Broken Windows . They 've continued to kick out quality rock music ever since , but never have they sounded as inspired as they did at the turn of the millennium . On \u201c Roseability \u201d \u2014 the album 's best song , an alt - rock masterpiece worthy of all the hyperbole in the world \u2014 Woomble suggests that paging through \u201c scrapbooks and photograph albums \u201d is a useless exercise , that you ca n't learn anything useful by looking backwards . It 's a disputable thesis , particularly when digging through the past leads you back to an album like this one ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Beginning with version 3.7.0 ( 2010 - 07 - 21 ) , a new \" Write - Ahead Log \" option ( hereafter referred to as \" WAL \" ) is available . There are advantages and disadvantages to using WAL instead of a rollback journal . Advantages include : But there are also disadvantages : The traditional rollback journal works by writing a copy of the original unchanged database content into a separate rollback journal file and then writing changes directly into the database file . In the event of a crash or ROLLBACK , the original content contained in the rollback journal is played back into the database file to revert the database file to its original state . The COMMIT occurs when the rollback journal is deleted . The WAL approach inverts this . The original content is preserved in the database file and the changes are appended into a separate WAL file . A COMMIT occurs when a special record indicating a commit is appended to the WAL . Thus a COMMIT can happen without ever writing to the original database , which allows readers to continue operating from the original unaltered database while changes are simultaneously being committed into the WAL . Multiple transactions can be appended to the end of a single WAL file . Of course , one wants to eventually transfer all the transactions that are appended in the WAL file back into the original database . Moving the WAL file transactions back into the database is called a \" checkpoint \" . Another way to think about the difference between rollback and write - ahead log is that in the rollback - journal approach , there are two primitive operations , reading and writing , whereas with a write - ahead log there are now three primitive operations : reading , writing , and checkpointing . By default , SQLite does a checkpoint automatically when the WAL file reaches a threshold size of 1000 pages . ( The SQLITE_DEFAULT_WAL_AUTOCHECKPOINT compile - time option can be used to specify a different default . ) Applications using WAL do not have to do anything in order to for these checkpoints to occur . But if they want to , applications can adjust the automatic checkpoint threshold . Or they can turn off the automatic checkpoints and run checkpoints during idle moments or in a separate thread or process . When a read operation begins on a WAL - mode database , it first remembers the location of the last valid commit record in the WAL . Call this point the \" end mark \" . Because the WAL can be growing and adding new commit records while various readers connect to the database , each reader can potentially have its own end mark . But for any particular reader , the end mark is unchanged for the duration of the transaction , thus ensuring that a single read transaction only sees the database content as it existed at a single point in time . When a reader needs a page of content , it first checks the WAL to see if that page appears there , and if so it pulls in the last copy of the page that occurs in the WAL prior to the reader 's end mark . If no copy of the page exists in the WAL prior to the reader 's end mark , then the page is read from the original database file . Readers can exist in separate processes , so to avoid forcing every reader to scan the entire WAL looking for pages ( the WAL file can grow to multiple megabytes , depending on how often checkpoints are run ) , a data structure called the \" wal-index \" is maintained in shared memory which helps readers locate pages in the WAL quickly and with a minimum of I \/O . The wal-index greatly improves the performance of readers , but the use of shared memory means that all readers must exist on the same machine . This is why the write - ahead log implementation will not work on a network filesystem . Writers merely append new content to the end of the WAL file . Because writers do nothing that would interfere with the actions of readers , writers and readers can run at the same time . However , since there is only one WAL file , there can only be one writer at a time . A checkpoint operation takes content from the WAL file and transfers it back into the original database file . A checkpoint can run concurrently with readers , however the checkpoint must stop when it reaches a page in the WAL that is past the end mark of any current reader . The checkpoint has to stop at that point because otherwise it might overwrite part of the database file that the reader is actively using . The checkpoint remembers ( in the wal - index ) how far it got and will resume transferring content from the WAL to the database from where it left off on the next invocation . Thus a long - running read transaction can prevent a checkpointer from making progress . But presumably every read transaction will eventually end and the checkpointer will be able to continue . Whenever a write operation occurs , the writer checks how much progress the checkpointer has made , and if the entire WAL has been transferred into the database and synced and if no readers are making use of the WAL , then the writer will rewind the WAL back to the beginning and start putting new transactions at the beginning of the WAL . This mechanism prevents a WAL file from growing without bound . Write transactions are very fast since they only involve writing the content once ( versus twice for rollback - journal transactions ) and because the writes are all sequential . Further , syncing the content to the disk is not required , as long as the application is willing to sacrifice durability following a power loss or hard reboot . ( Writers sync the WAL on every transaction commit if PRAGMA synchronous is set to FULL but omit this sync if PRAGMA synchronous is set to NORMAL . ) On the other hand , read performance deteriorates as the WAL file grows in size since each reader must check the WAL file for the content and the time needed to check the WAL file is proportional to the size of the WAL file . The wal- index helps find content in the WAL file much faster , but performance still falls off with increasing WAL file size . Hence , to maintain good read performance it is important to keep the WAL file size down by running checkpoints at regular intervals . Checkpointing does require sync operations in order to avoid the possibility of database corruption following a power loss or hard reboot . The WAL must be synced to persistent storage prior to moving content from the WAL into the database and the database file must by synced prior to resetting the WAL . Checkpoint also requires more seeking . The checkpointer makes an effort to do as many sequential page writes to the database as it can ( the pages are transferred from WAL to database in ascending order ) but even then there will typically be many seek operations interspersed among the page writes . These factors combine to make checkpoints slower than write transactions . The default strategy is to allow successive write transactions to grow the WAL until the WAL becomes about 1000 pages in size , then to run a checkpoint operation for each subsequent COMMIT until the WAL is reset to be smaller than 1000 pages . By default , the checkpoint will be run automatically by the same thread that does the COMMIT that pushes the WAL over its size limit . This has the effect of causing most COMMIT operations to be very fast but an occasional COMMIT ( those that trigger a checkpoint ) to be much slower . If that effect is undesirable , then the application can disable automatic checkpointing and run the periodic checkpoints in a separate thread , or separate process . ( Links to commands and interfaces to accomplish this are shown below . ) Note that with PRAGMA synchronous set to NORMAL , the checkpoint is the only operation to issue an I \/O barrier or sync operation ( fsync ( ) on unix or Flush FileBuffers ( ) on windows ) . If an application therefore runs checkpoint in a separate thread or process , the main thread or process that is doing database queries and updates will never block on a sync operation . This helps to prevent \" latch - up \" in applications running on a busy disk drive . The downside to this configuration is that transactions are no longer durable and might rollback following a power failure or hard reset . Notice too that there is a tradeoff between average read performance and average write performance . To maximize the read performance , one wants to keep the WAL as small as possible and hence run checkpoints frequently , perhaps as often as every COMMIT . To maximize write performance , one wants to amortize the cost of each checkpoint over as many writes as possible , meaning that one wants to run checkpoints infrequently and let the WAL grow as large as possible before each checkpoint . The decision of how often to run checkpoints may therefore vary from one application to another depending on the relative read and write performance requirements of the application . The default strategy is to run a checkpoint once the WAL reaches 1000 pages and this strategy seems to work well in test applications on workstations , but other strategies might work better on different platforms or for different workloads . An SQLite database connection defaults to journal_mode= DELETE . To convert to WAL mode , use the following pragma : PRAGMA journal_mode= WAL ; The journal_mode pragma returns a string which is the new journal mode . On success , the pragma will return the string \" wal \" . If the conversion to WAL could not be completed ( for example , if the VFS does not support the necessary shared - memory primitives ) then the journaling mode will be unchanged and the string returned from the primitive will be the prior journaling mode ( for example \" delete \" ) . By default , SQLite will automatically checkpoint whenever a COMMIT occurs that causes the WAL file to be 1000 pages or more in size , or when the last database connection on a database file closes . The default configuration is intended to work well for most applications . But programs that want more control can force a checkpoint using the wal_checkpoint pragma or by calling the sqlite3 _wal_checkpoint ( ) C interface . The automatic checkpoint threshold can be changed or automatic checkpointing can be completely disabled using the wal_autocheckpoint pragma or by calling the sqlite3 _wal_autocheckpoint ( ) C interface . A program can also use sqlite3 _wal_hook ( ) to register a callback to be invoked whenever any transaction commits to the WAL . This callback can then invoke sqlite3 _wal_checkpoint ( ) or sqlite3 _wal_checkpoint_v2 ( ) based on whatever criteria it thinks is appropriate . ( The automatic checkpoint mechanism is implemented as a simple wrapper around sqlite3 _wal_hook ( ) . ) An application can initiate a checkpoint using any writable database connection on the database simply by invoking sqlite3 _wal_checkpoint ( ) or sqlite3 _wal_checkpoint_v2 ( ) . There are three subtypes of checkpoints that vary in their aggressiveness : PASSIVE , FULL , and RESTART . The default checkpoint style is PASSIVE , which does as much work as it can without interfering with other database connections , and which might not run to completion if there are concurrent readers or writers . All checkpoints initiated by sqlite3 _wal_checkpoint ( ) and by the automatic checkpoint mechanism are PASSIVE . FULL and RESTART checkpoints try harder to run the checkpoint to completion and can only be initiated by a call to sqlite3 _wal_checkpoint_v2 ( ) . See the sqlite3 _wal_checkpoint_v2 ( ) documentation for additional information on FULL and RESET checkpoints . Unlike the other journaling modes , PRAGMA journal_mode= WAL is persistent . If a process sets WAL mode , then closes and reopens the database , the database will come back in WAL mode . In contrast , if a process sets ( for example ) PRAGMA journal_mode= TRUNCATE and then closes and reopens the database will come back up in the default rollback mode of DELETE rather than the previous TRUNCATE setting . The persistence of WAL mode means that applications can be converted to using SQLite in WAL mode without making any changes to the application itself . One has merely to run \" PRAGMA journal_mode= WAL ; \" on the database file ( s ) using the command - line shell or other utility , then restart the application . The WAL journal mode will be set on all connections to the same database file if it is set on any one connection . While a database connection is open on a WAL - mode database , SQLite maintains an extra journal file called a \" Write Ahead Log \" or \" WAL File \" . The name of this file on disk is usually the name of the database file with an extra \" - wal \" suffix , though different naming rules may apply if SQLite is compiled with SQLITE_ENABLE_8_3_NAMES . The WAL file exists for as long as any database connection has the database open . Usually , the WAL file is deleted automatically when the last connection to the database closes . However , if the last process to have the database open exits without cleanly shutting down the database connection , or if the SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL file control is used , then the WAL file might be retained on disk after all connections to the database have been closed . The WAL file is part of the persistent state of the database and should be kept with the database if the database is copied or moved . If a database file is separated from its WAL file , then transactions that were previously committed to the database might be lost , or the database file might become corrupted . The only safe way to remove a WAL file is to open the database file using one of the sqlite3 _open ( ) interfaces then immediately close the database using sqlite3 _close ( ) . The WAL file format is precisely defined and is cross-platform . Older versions of SQLite could not read a WAL - mode database that was read-only . In other words , write access was required in order to read a WAL - mode database . This constraint was relaxed beginning with SQLite version 3.22.0 ( 2018-01 - 22 ) . On newer versions of SQLite , a WAL - mode database on read - only media , or a WAL - mode database that lacks write permission , can still be read as long as one or more of the following conditions are met : Even though it is possible to open a read - only WAL - mode database , it is good practice to converted to PRAGMA journal_mode= DELETE prior to burning an SQLite database image onto read - only media . In normal cases , new content is appended to the WAL file until the WAL file accumulates about 1000 pages ( and is thus about 4 MB in size ) at which point a checkpoint is automatically run and the WAL file is recycled . The checkpoint does not normally truncate the WAL file ( unless the journal_size_limit pragma is set ) . Instead , it merely causes SQLite to start overwriting the WAL file from the beginning . This is done because it is normally faster to overwrite an existing file than to append . When the last connection to a database closes , that connection does one last checkpoint and then deletes the WAL and its associated shared - memory file , to clean up the disk . So in the vast majority of cases , applications need not worry about the WAL file at all . SQLite will automatically take care of it . But it is possible to get SQLite into a state where the WAL file will grow without bound , causing excess disk space usage and slow queries speeds . The following bullets enumerate some of the ways that this can happen and how to avoid them . Disabling the automatic checkpoint mechanism . In its default configuration , SQLite will checkpoint the WAL file at the conclusion of any transaction when the WAL file is more than 1000 pages long . However , compile - time and run-time options exist that can disable or defer this automatic checkpoint . If an application disables the automatic checkpoint , then there is nothing to prevent the WAL file from growing excessively . Checkpoint starvation . A checkpoint is only able to run to completion , and reset the WAL file , if there are no other database connections using the WAL file . If another connection has a read transaction open , then the checkpoint cannot reset the WAL file because doing so might delete content out from under the reader . The checkpoint will do as much work as it can without upsetting the reader , but it cannot run to completion . The checkpoint will start up again where it left off after the next write transaction . This repeats until some checkpoint is able to complete . However , if a database has many concurrent overlapping readers and there is always at least one active reader , then no checkpoints will be able to complete and hence the WAL file will grow without bound . This scenario can be avoided by ensuring that there are \" reader gaps \" : times when no processes are reading from the database and that checkpoints are attempted during those times . In applications with many concurrent readers , one might also consider running manual checkpoints with the SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_RESTART or SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_TRUNCATE option which will ensure that the checkpoint runs to completion before returning . The disadvantage of using SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_RESTART and SQLITE_CHECKPOINT_TRUNCATE is that readers might block while the checkpoint is running . Very large write transactions . A checkpoint can only complete when no other transactions are running , which means the WAL file cannot be reset in the middle of a write transaction . So a large change to a large database might result in a large WAL file . The WAL file will be checkpointed once the write transaction completes ( assuming there are no other readers blocking it ) but in the meantime , the file can grow very big . As of SQLite version 3.11.0 ( 2016-02 - 15 ) , the WAL file for a single transaction should be proportional in size to the transaction itself . Pages that are changed by the transaction should only be written into the WAL file once . However , with older versions of SQLite , the same page might be written into the WAL file multiple times if the transaction grows larger than the page cache . The wal-index is implemented using an ordinary file that is mmapped for robustness . Early ( pre-release ) implementations of WAL mode stored the wal-index in volatile shared - memory , such as files created in \/ dev \/ shm on Linux or \/ tmp on other unix systems . The problem with that approach is that processes with a different root directory ( changed via chroot ) will see different files and hence use different shared memory areas , leading to database corruption . Other methods for creating nameless shared memory blocks are not portable across the various flavors of unix . And we could not find any method to create nameless shared memory blocks on windows . The only way we have found to guarantee that all processes accessing the same database file use the same shared memory is to create the shared memory by mmapping a file in the same directory as the database itself . Using an ordinary disk file to provide shared memory has the disadvantage that it might actually do unnecessary disk I \/O by writing the shared memory to disk . However , the developers do not think this is a major concern since the wal-index rarely exceeds 32 KiB in size and is never synced . Furthermore , the wal-index backing file is deleted when the last database connection disconnects , which often prevents any real disk I\/O from ever happening . Specialized applications for which the default implementation of shared memory is unacceptable can devise alternative methods via a custom VFS . For example , if it is known that a particular database will only be accessed by threads within a single process , the wal-index can be implemented using heap memory instead of true shared memory . Beginning in SQLite version 3.7.4 ( 2010 - 12-07 ) , WAL databases can be created , read , and written even if shared memory is unavailable as long as the locking_mode is set to EXCLUSIVE before the first attempted access . In other words , a process can interact with a WAL database without using shared memory if that process is guaranteed to be the only process accessing the database . This feature allows WAL databases to be created , read , and written by legacy VFSes that lack the \" version 2 \" shared - memory methods x ShmMap , xShmLock , xShmBarrier , and xShmUnmap on the sqlite3 _io_methods object . If EXCLUSIVE locking mode is set prior to the first WAL - mode database access , then SQLite never attempts to call any of the shared - memory methods and hence no shared - memory wal-index is ever created . In that case , the database connection remains in EXCLUSIVE mode as long as the journal mode is WAL ; attempts to change the locking mode using \" PRAGMA locking_mode= NORMAL ; \" are no-ops . The only way to change out of EXCLUSIVE locking mode is to first change out of WAL journal mode . If NORMAL locking mode is in effect for the first WAL - mode database access , then the shared - memory wal-index is created . This means that the underlying VFS must support the \" version 2 \" shared - memory . If the VFS does not support shared - memory methods , then the attempt to open a database that is already in WAL mode , or the attempt convert a database into WAL mode , will fail . As long as exactly one connection is using a shared - memory wal-index , the locking mode can be changed freely between NORMAL and EXCLUSIVE . It is only when the shared - memory wal-index is omitted , when the locking mode is EXCLUSIVE prior to the first WAL - mode database access , that the locking mode is stuck in EXCLUSIVE . The second advantage of WAL - mode is that writers do not block readers and readers to do not block writers . This is mostly true . But there are some obscure cases where a query against a WAL - mode database can return SQLITE_BUSY , so applications should be prepared for that happenstance . Cases where a query against a WAL - mode database can return SQLITE_BUSY include the following : If another database connection has the database mode open in exclusive locking mode then all queries against the database will return SQLITE_BUSY . Both Chrome and Firefox open their database files in exclusive locking mode , so attempts to read Chrome or Firefox databases while the applications are running will run into this problem , for example . When the last connection to a particular database is closing , that connection will acquire an exclusive lock for a short time while it cleans up the WAL and shared - memory files . If a second database tries to open and query the database while the first connection is still in the middle of its cleanup process , the second connection might get an SQLITE_BUSY error . If the last connection to a database crashed , then the first new connection to open the database will start a recovery process . An exclusive lock is held during recovery . So if a third database connection tries to jump in and query while the second connection is running recovery , the third connection will get an SQLITE_BUSY error . The database file format is unchanged for WAL mode . However , the WAL file and the wal-index are new concepts and so older versions of SQLite will not know how to recover a crashed SQLite database that was operating in WAL mode when the crash occurred . To prevent older versions of SQLite ( prior to version 3.7.0 , 2010 - 07 - 22 ) from trying to recover a WAL - mode database ( and making matters worse ) the database file format version numbers ( bytes 18 and 19 in the database header ) are increased from 1 to 2 in WAL mode . Thus , if an older version of SQLite attempts to connect to an SQLite database that is operating in WAL mode , it will report an error along the lines of \" file is encrypted or is not a database \" . One can explicitly change out of WAL mode using a pragma such as this : PRAGMA journal_mode= DELETE ; Deliberately changing out of WAL mode changes the database file format version numbers back to 1 so that older versions of SQLite can once again access the database file ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

In 2002 , after years of low achievement and budget crises in the School District of Philadelphia , the state of Pennsylvania launched a takeover of the district . Subsequent to the state takeover , the district adopted what is known as the \u201c diverse provider \u201d model , turning over the management of some of the lowest- achieving schools to for-profit and nonprofit organizations and two local universities and providing additional resources to the private managers . Philadelphia became a test case for the private management of public schools and other interventions sanctioned by the No Child Left Behind Act. State Takeover , School Restructuring , Private Management , and Student Achievement in Philadelphia examines achievement effects in the privately managed schools and in two groups of schools given special support under district management , in the context of districtwide achievement trends . Four years after the state takeover , achievement results across Philadelphia had risen substantially . Within Philadelphia , the schools managed by private providers were doing neither better nor worse than districtwide achievement trends . District - managed schools given additional resources but no specific intervention were likewise doing about as well as other schools in the district . In contrast , district - managed schools given additional resources and a \u201c restructuring \u201d intervention showed larger achievement gains in mathematics .

But if you 're a property owner looking for green , sustainable building materials , consider EcoClad , a recently developed alternative to wood , vinyl , and aluminum siding . Eco Clad Siding This new , environmentally - friendly and sustainable siding for residential and commercial installation is composed of bamboo fibers , post-consumer recycled paper , and recycled wood fiber . The exterior - grade product introduced by KlipTech is called EcoClad . This siding is as durable as metal , brick , and stucco exteriors , and does not support bacteria or fungus growth . EcoClad is also free of VOCs ( volatile organic compounds ) and contains no benzene . Klip Tech claims the product has seven different credits within U.S. Green Building Council 's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED ) green building standards . According to the USGBC , LEED - certified buildings satisfy the following criteria : - Lower operating costs and increased asset value . - Reduced waste sent to landfills . - Conservation of energy and water . - Assurance of health and safety for occupants . - Reduction of harmful greenhouse gas emissions . - Eligibility for zoning allowances , and other incentives in hundreds of cities . - Demonstration of an owner 's commitment to environmental stewardship and social responsibility . Now let 's look at the downside of the big 3 currently popular siding materials : wood , vinyl , and aluminum . Wood Siding Wood siding , while providing a warm natural look to the exterior of a building , is not an eco-friendly choice . Deforestation for siding , furniture , and other lumber needs is unnecessary when there are so many sustainable alternatives to wood available . Trees destroyed for the siding project will take years to grow back , if replacement trees are even planted . Additionally , since it requires more maintenance than other siding options , lumber siding will shrink and expand , warp , rot , and change color over time . Wood also attracts highly destructive pests such as termites and carpenter ants . Vinyl Siding According to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention ( CDC ) , \" Vinyl has some environmental and health concerns , as do most exterior treatments . Vinyl chloride monomer , of which polyvinyl chloride siding is made , is a strong carcinogen and , when heated , releases toxic gases and vapors . \" Not only does this popular siding emit toxic VOCs , it also is prone to warping and shrinkage . Vinyl tends to melt in high heat , as well . Aluminum Siding Aluminum siding can be easily dented and chipped . Over time , it will \" chalk , \" meaning that the color will fade and require painting . Replacing damaged areas is difficult due to the way this siding is installed , and it can be difficult to match the colors of old and new siding . Additionally , aluminum siding provides virtually no insulation to the building where it is installed . Even worse , aluminum siding conducts electricity . This could be a problem if the siding were to make contact with electrical wiring or downed power lines or be struck by lightning . This conductivity characteristic can also affect wireless Internet , TV , and radio reception . For consumers looking for an environmentally sustainable and non-toxic alternative to wood , vinyl and aluminum siding , EcoClad is a green choice .

According to various aviation sources the helicopter , a Bell 412EP , leaked fuel into the cargo hold reportedly amounting to more than 300 liters ( fuel capacity of the helicopter 1257 liters not including auxiliary fuel of up to 617 liters ) . The fuel entered the avionics bay and caused substantial damage . Ground observers reported the aircraft was seen in Prestwick with all cargo doors , nose door as well as all gear doors wide open for more than a week . The occurrence aircraft remained on the ground in Prestwick until April 11th 2017 , then positioned to Luxembourg and remained on the ground there until Apr 29th 2017 before returning to service . On May 1st 2017 the airline tweeted a photo of the aircraft stating : \" Back in service , LX-VCF ! \" On Jul 12th 2018 the AAIB released their bulletin concluding : Regardless of the exact mechanism by which the fuel escaped from the helicopter , the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations exist to prevent the transportation of hazardous cargo representing a hazard to the safety of an aircraft . Adequate steps were not taken to correctly prepare the helicopter for transport and this situation was not identified prior to it being offered for transportation by air . The investigation identified that the dilution of responsibility among the various individuals and agencies involved meant that no one agency or individual could assure that the shipping documentation reflected the actual condition of the helicopter and was in compliance with the DGR . An inspection of the helicopter prior to travel was superficial in nature and , although no attempt was made to verify the actual fuel state of the helicopter , incorrectly concluded that the helicopter had been defuelled . This resulted in the helicopter shipment being identified as unrestricted cargo , despite containing non-declared dangerous goods . The fuel hazard was not identified to the operator or the commander of the flight on which the helicopter travelled , and they were therefore unaware of the risk it posed . The escape of fuel from the helicopter during the flight represented a substantial hazard to the safety of the aircraft , the flight crew and those on the ground at Prestwick Airport . The containment actions taken by the RFFS at Prestwick Airport substantially reduced the possibility of a more adverse outcome . The AAIB wrote : The escape of fuel from the helicopter represented a substantial hazard to the safety of the aircraft , the flight crew and those on the ground at Prestwick Airport . The airport RFFS advised that the measured fuel vapour levels within the aircraft indicated a high risk of explosion and that the fuel flammability limits were potentially in range . Additionally , photographs show that fuel was exiting the aircraft close to the left body landing gear and pooling beneath the aircraft . The presence of fuel in proximity to potentially hot wheel brakes created a substantial risk of fire .

Are they having a laugh ? Most travellers ' experience of this northern Peloponnese city involves arriving on a ferry from Italy or Corfu , jumping on a bus or train to Athens and getting the hell out as quickly as possible . European Capital of Culture ? You might as well give the award to Dover . So how come I 'm sitting in a boutique hotel by the port , drinking a glass of fine wine and looking out on to a very cool scene indeed ? Pedestrianised Aghios Nikolaos street leads up from the sea , lined on either side by stylish cafes and bars . A dense , noisy crowd of people sits chatting and drinking . At nearby Plateia Yiorgos the yellow and cream exterior of the Municipal Theatre , designed by Ernest Ziller , faces the elegant terrace of the Art Nouveau Caf\u00e9 Moliendo , filled with a slightly older crowd . On a hill high above the city stand the spotlit ruins of a 12th - century Turkish kastro . A cool wind blows in off the sea and the sound of music and laughter drifts through the streets . Clearly there is more to Patras than meets the eye . Flushed with the success of last year 's Olympic Games in Athens , and with government money pouring in , Patras is on a roll . Nearly \u00a3 100 m is being spent on the regeneration of Greece 's third - largest city . A spectacular suspension bridge across to the mainland opened in 2004 . The streets are alive with reconstruction projects , including a redeveloped seafront and new pedestrianised zones . Rail and road links with Athens and nearby tourist attractions are being improved . Meanwhile , a new generation of hotels , cafes , restaurants and clubs has sprung up seemingly overnight . Once you start to explore a neglected city properly , of course , all sorts of treasures emerge . In addition to its kastro , Patras also boasts a Roman Odeon built in 160BC , second in splendour only to that of the Herod Atticus in Athens . In the delightful upper quarter of the city there are tiny Byzantine chapels , a working Turkish hammam dating from 1400 and a tangle of narrow lanes and leafy squares with magnificent views out across the Gulf of Corinth . Even the lower town , laid out on a grid pattern 200 years ago , is not without its charms . Patras has been an important port for 3,000 years . In the 19th century it was dominated by wealthy British and German merchants , whose neo-classical mansions are dotted around the city . More than 50 of them are being restored for this year 's celebrations . But it is people who are Patras 's trump card . This is a party town , famous in the rest of Greece for its carnival , 170 years old and the biggest in the country . One-fifth of the city 's population of 250,000 are students and there 's a local tradition of political engagement and radicalism . This is not a tourist town as such ( although visitors are welcome ) , but , gratifyingly , a city overrun by its own inhabitants . In recent years Patras has suffered from factory closures and high unemployment , so 2006 also offers the chance of economic regeneration . According to Christos Roilos , co-ordinator of the Cultural Capital programme , 2006 will be about grassroots activity as much as ' high ' culture . ' The people of Patras are not going to be spectators at this year 's party . They have the leading roles . ' A million visitors pass through Patras port each year . This year that figure could double or treble , making for a very big party indeed . Patras may well be having a laugh in 2006 , but it wo n't be at its own expense . The 60- second guide to Patras Where to stay Hotel Primarolia , 33 Othonos Amalias ( 0030 2610 624900 , www.arthotel.gr) is the best hotel in Patras ; a former distillery with 14 rooms tucked around an oval - shaped atrium , hung with contemporary Greek art . With doubles from \u00a3 84 , it 's exceptional value for money . Where to eat Any of the cafes in Patras centre can provide the usual Greek breakfast of high - octane coffee and pastries . Or stroll south down the seafront to the restored lighthouse , where the plate - glass windows of Cafe Faroz offer gorgeous views of the fishing harbour and the main port beyond . For lunch or dinner head to Trion Navarhon Street , where a string of tavernas lines the wide pedestrianised thoroughfare . Two of the best are Pai Kyros , at 72 , with tables set outside , young and friendly owners and a modern approach to Greek staples such as saganaki fried cheese . Mythos , on the corner at 181 , is small and homely , with three floors of jumbled furniture and home cooking . In the upper town , try Kyrenia , 63 Kolokotroni St. This simple Cypriot restaurant is a local favourite . Try talatouri , a spicier version of tzatziki , and damaskinato : chicken served with sweet and sour sauce and plums . Expect to pay around \u00a3 10 - \u00a3 15 for two . Big night out A good place to start is Aghios Nikolaos street . Palaion and Karavitis , close to each other at 13 and 23 , are venerable institutions which have recently converted to a younger clientele but maintained their style . Palaion has a long , marble - topped bar and smart red- waistcoated waiters ; Karavitis converts to a music bar with DJ after 11 pm . For something more idiosyncratic head to Radinou Street , a small alleyway off the central Riga Fereou . This has several excellent bars , including Multi , Lobby and Choice ; plus the intriguing Taj Mahal , with low couches , brass - topped tables and a strange hybrid of Moroccan , Indian and Chinese decor . Popular clubs are H20 on Riga Fereou and Di Oggi on Yerekestopoulou Street . Notos on Patreos Street has laid - back jazz , and Harama , 1 Smyrnis Street , is an old - fashioned bouzouki joint with live music . Cultural events Highlights of Patras 's programme as European Capital of Culture include street carnivals ( until 5 March ) , performances of ancient Greek drama such as Sophocles 's Oedipus Rex and Euripides 's Medea ( 19 May - 4 June ) and classical music performances . For details see www.patras2006.gr. Shopping Mezonos Street has the usual international outlets , including clothes by local heroine Sophia Kokosalaki but funkier places are to be found on Riga Fereou . Parazar at 135 has excellent jewellery , as does The Floy Doy at 101 . Excursions Patras is superbly placed for exploring other sights . Delphi is 90 minutes away , either by hire car from Alamo ( 0870 400 4562 ; www.alamo.co.uk), or bus . Olympia is an hour away by road . Ferries to Kefalonia take two hours . During summer locals flock to the beaches around Rio , with its stylish beach bars such as Tam Toom and Easy Busy . Essentials Paul Mansfield travelled with Filoxenia ( 01653 617755 ; www.filoxenia.co.uk). Three nights at the Hotel Primarolia costs from \u00a3 498 per person B&B , with flights and taxi to Athens bus or train station . Trains between Athens and Patras run several times a day . The faster Intercity trains ( three and a half hours , \u00a3 12 return ) leave from Aghia Anargyri station in Athens ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Welcome , Slashdot readers . Remember , this Web site is for entertainment purposes only . Sean wants to know what the role of MS- DOS was in Windows 95 . I may regret answering this question since it 's clear Slashdot bait . ( Even if Sean did n't intend it that way , that 's what it 's going to turn into . ) Here goes . Remember , what I write here may not be 100 % true , but it is \u201c true enough . \u201d ( In other words , it gets the point across without getting bogged down in nitpicky details . ) MS - DOS served two purposes in Windows 95 . - It served as the boot loader . - It acted as the 16 - bit legacy device driver layer . When Windows 95 started up , a customized version of MS- DOS was loaded , and it 's that customized version that processed your CONFIG. SYS file , launched COMMAND.COM , which ran your AUTOEXEC . BAT and which eventually ran WIN. COM , which began the process of booting up the VMM , or the 32 - bit virtual machine manager . The customized version of MS- DOS was fully functional as far as the phrase \u201c fully functional \u201d can be applied to MS- DOS in the first place . It had to be , since it was all that was running when you ran Windows 95 in \u201c single MS- DOS application mode . \u201d The WIN.COM program started booting what most people think of as \u201c Windows \u201d proper . It used the copy of MS- DOS to load the virtual machine manager , read the SYSTEM . INI file , load the virtual device drivers , and then it turned off any running copy of EMM386 and switched into protected mode . It 's protected mode that is what most people think of as \u201c the real Windows . \u201d Once in protected mode , the virtual device drivers did their magic . Among other things those drivers did was \u201c suck the brains out of MS - DOS , \u201d transfer all that state to the 32 - bit file system manager , and then shut off MS - DOS . All future file system operations would get routed to the 32 - bit file system manager . If a program issued an int 21h , the 32 - bit file system manager would be responsible for handling it . And that 's where the second role of MS- DOS comes into play . For you see , MS - DOS programs and device drivers loved to mess with the operating system itself . They would replace the int 21h service vector , they would patch the operating system , they would patch the low - level disk I \/O services int 25h and int 26h . They would also do crazy things to the BIOS interrupts such as int 13h , the low - level disk I\/O interrupt . When a program issued an int 21h call to access MS - DOS , the call would go first to the 32 - bit file system manager , who would do some preliminary munging and then , if it detected that somebody had hooked the int 21h vector , it would jump back into the 16 - bit code to let the hook run . Replacing the int 21h service vector is logically analogous to subclassing a window . You get the old vector and set your new vector . When your replacement handler is called , you do some stuff , and then call the original vector to do \u201c whatever would normally happen . \u201d After the original vector returned , you might do some more work before returning to the original caller . One of the 16 - bit drivers loaded by CONFIG. SYS was called IFSMGR.SYS . The job of this 16 - bit driver was to hook MS - DOS first before the other drivers and programs got a chance ! This driver was in cahoots with the 32 - bit file system manager , for its job was to jump from 16 - bit code back into 32 - bit code to let the 32 - bit file system manager continue its work . In other words , MS - DOS was just an extremely elaborate decoy . Any 16 - bit drivers and programs would patch or hook what they thought was the real MS - DOS , but which was in reality just a decoy . If the 32 - bit file system manager detected that somebody bought the decoy , it told the decoy to quack . Let 's start with a system that did n't contain any \u201c evil \u201d drivers or programs that patched or hooked MS - DOS . | Program calls int 21h | 32 - bit file system manager checks that nobody has patched or hooked MS - DOS | Program gets result | This was paradise . The 32 - bit file system manager was able to do all the work without having to deal with pesky drivers that did bizarro things . Note the extra step of updating the state variables inside MS-DOS . Even though we extracted the state variables from MS - DOS during the boot process , we keep those state variables in sync because drivers and programs frequently \u201c knew \u201d how those state variables worked and bypassed the operating system and accessed them directly . Therefore , the file system manager had to maintain the charade that MS - DOS was running the show ( even though it was n't ) so that those drivers and programs saw what they wanted . Note also that those state variables were per-VM . ( I.e. , each MS- DOS \u201c box \u201d you opened got its own copy of those state variables . ) After all , each MS - DOS box had its idea of what the current directory was , what was in the file tables , that sort of thing . This was all an act , however , because the real list of open files was kept in by the 32 - bit file system manager . It had to be , because disk caches had to be kept coherent , and file sharing need to be enforced globally . If one MS - DOS box opened a file for exclusive access , then an attempt by a program running in another MS - DOS box to open the file should fail with a sharing violation . Okay , that was the easy case . The hard case is if you had a driver that hooked int 21h . I do n't know what the driver does , let 's say that it 's a network driver that intercepts I \/O to network drives and handles them in some special way . Let 's suppose also that there 's some TSR running in the MS - DOS box which has hooked int 21h so it can print a 1 to the screen when the int 21h is active and a 2 when the int 21h completes . Let 's follow a call to a local device ( not a network device , so the network driver does n't do anything ) : | Program calls int 21h | 32 - bit file system manager notices that somebody has patched or hooked MS - DOS 16 - bit TSR ( front end ) prints a 1 to the screen 16 - bit network driver ( front end ) decides that this is n't a network I \/O request calls previous handler ( which is the 16 - bit IFSMGR hook ) 16 - bit IFSMGR hook tells 32 - bit file system manager 32 - bit file system manager regains control 16 - bit network driver ( back end ) returns to caller 16 - bit TSR ( back end ) prints a 2 to the screen | Program gets result | Notice that all the work is still being done by the 32 - bit file system manager . It 's just that the call gets routed through all the 16 - bit stuff to maintain the charade that 16 - bit MS- DOS is still running the show . The only 16 - bit code that actually ran ( in red ) is the stuff that the TSR and network driver installed , plus a tiny bit of glue in the 16 - bit IFSMGR hook . Notice that no 16 - bit MS- DOS code ran . The 32 - bit file manager took over for MS-DOS . A similar sort of \u201c take over but let the crazy stuff happen if somebody is doing crazy stuff \u201d dance took place when the I \/O subsystem took over control of your hard drive from 16 - bit device drivers . If it recognized the drivers , it would \u201c suck their brains out \u201d and take over all the operations , in the same way that the 32 - bit file system manager took over operations from 16 - bit MS-DOS . On the other hand , if the driver was n't one that the I\/O subsystem recognized , it let the driver be the one in charge of the drive . If this happened , it was said that you were going through the \u201c real - mode mapper \u201d since \u201c real mode \u201d was name for the CPU mode when protected mode was not running ; in other words , the mapper was letting the 16 - bit drivers do the work . Now , if you were unlucky enough to be using the real - mode mapper , you probably noticed that system performance to that drive was pretty awful . That 's because you were using the old clunky single - threaded 16 - bit drivers instead of the faster , multithread - enabled 32 - bit drivers . ( When a 16 - bit driver was running , no other I \/O could happen because 16 - bit drivers were not designed for multi-threading . ) This awfulness of the real - mode mapper actually came in handy in a backwards way , because it was an early indication that your computer got infected with an MS - DOS virus . After all , MS- DOS viruses did what TSRs and drivers did : They hooked interrupt vectors and took over control of your hard drive . From the I \/O subsystem 's point of view , they looked just like a 16 - bit hard disk device driver ! When people complained , \u201c Windows suddenly started running really slow , \u201d we asked them to look at the system performance page in the control panel and see if it says that \u201c Some drives are using MS - DOS compatibility . \u201d If so , then it meant that the real - mode mapper was in charge , and if you did n't change hardware , it probably means a virus . Now , there are parts of MS- DOS that are unrelated to file I \/O . For example , there are functions for allocating memory , parsing a string containing potential wildcards into FCB format , that sort of thing . Those functions were still handled by MS - DOS since they were just \u201c helper library \u201d type functions and there was no benefit to reimplementing them in 32 - bit code aside from just being able to say that you did it . The old 16 - bit code worked just fine , and if you let it do the work , you preserved compatibility with programs that patched MS - DOS in order to alter the behavior of those functions ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

HOLLYWOOD SEEMS TO have discovered the considerable advantages of working in Berlin \u2014 this multi-layered and relatively inexpensive city \u2014 big time . In recent months as many as three American blockbusters have been undergoing filming at any one time at Berlin 's legendary Babelsberg studios , not to mention several German and European productions . Shooting has just been completed on Valkyrie , Tom Cruise 's new movie , and The International directed by Tom Tykwer ( of Run , Lola , Run fame ) , starring Clive Owen and Naomi Watts , is well under way . Work has also started on The Reader , the film based on Bernard Schlink 's novel with Nicole Kidman in the lead , though the Australian star 's scenes wo n't be shot until later this month . Naturally , Berliners are quite pleased about all this , in a characteristically grouchy sort of way , and there have been many breathless reports in the local media on the booming film - work industry . Even better , there have been many golden opportunities for some extremely satisfying controversy , most of them involving scientologist Cruise . Top of the list has been the impassioned discussion about the star 's presumption in taking the role of Germany 's most famous resistance hero , Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg , despite more than a passing resemblance to the square - jawed Wehrmacht officer . Von Stauffenberg was executed in 1944 at the Bendler Block building complex ( now a national memorial ) in central Berlin , following the failed plot to assassinate Hitler . While Cruise was eventually able to hose down German sensitivities about his personal persuasions , it was just the first in a row of major setbacks . These culminated in having to reshoot the entire firing - squad sequence at the Bendler Block after film stock was mysteriously damaged at a Munich post-production company . Work on The International has been plain sailing by comparison , despite the expense of having to recreate a life - size version of the New York Guggenheim Museum for a shoot - out scene . According to dynamic Babelsberg chief Carl Woebcken , the studios and city offer immense opportunities for filmmakers . \" You can make both historical and modern urban films just as easily here , \" he told Berlin 's TIP magazine , \" and some locations have almost a village atmosphere . \" Sci-fi film Aeon Flux starring Charlize Theron was shot in the Bauhaus Museum , while the city provided several striking backdrops for The Bourne Supremacy and Flightplan . Of course , the city that hosts the Berlinale , Europe 's largest film festival ( which prides itself on being open to the public ) , has long been known for its enthusiasm for movies and movie-making , but Berlin 's cultural profusion offers a lot more besides . Autumn brings with it an extensive music , theatre and festival season . The annual Berlin Jazz Festival has just been held , and the six-day International Short Film Festival , which winds up tomorrow , has more than 200 contributions \u2014 including four works by Australians . Australian visual artists and designers continue to have a strong presence in the city . The German Architectural Centre 's four- week display of modern Australian architecture , which also ends tomorrow , takes a comprehensive look at the multifaceted transformations in contemporary Australian architecture and the increasing sensitivity to the specific environments in which it is built . The exhibition also illustrates how architectural traditions from the ' 50s to the ' 80s have shaped modern developments , and includes the work of people such as Glenn Murcutt , Harry Seidler and Robin Boyd . Sydney photographer and installation artist Simone Mangos continues her decade - long love - hate relationship with the city in her controversial exhibition titled The Ideology of Memory at the Museum for Photography . Her pictures and objects raise questions and objections about the divisive Holocaust Memorial , inaugurated two years ago , whose careless supervision she suggests allows the desecration of the memory of those killed . Almost as plentiful are the numbers of Australian musicians to be found in Berlin , either employed in the many orchestras , ensembles and groups , or working independently , such as the distinguished Brisbane composer Liza Lim , for whom the city is an ideal headquarters . Lim , who is based in Berlin for a year , has seen her works performed at venues as diverse as the Asian Museum ( during Asia - Pacific week ) , or at a grand old ballroom restored as a concert space , the setting for a recent composer \" portrait \" where two of her pieces were performed . \" Berlin is a very stimulating environment in which to live and work , because of the layered history of the place , \" says Lim . \" There 's such a rich diversity on offer . What 's really interesting is that the contemporary is part of a continuity with the past , there 's not a sharp break . \" The past is something that confronts Berlin on a daily basis , as Cruise learned only too well . In the wider arts scene , the city 's lingering East - West divisions are played out most obviously in the existence of the three opera houses \u2014 one of the more notorious but splendid anomalies of Berlin 's 40 - year partition . Over the course of a season Berliners have about 700 performances from which to choose . After many years of bitter wrangling it has been decided not to close any of the houses but to try and fuse stage workshops and administration services in a bid to save money . The most recent and most pressing dilemma concentrating the minds of politicians and cultural impresarios is the fate of the glamorous Staatsoper , in former East Berlin . The 250 - year- old house closely associated with star conductor Daniel Barenboim , is in desperate need of repair \u2014 to the tune of \u20ac 230 million ( $ 370 million ) . A complicated political poker game has ensued between the Berlin and federal governments as to who is to come up with the funds . Whatever the outcome , the Staatsoper must close for four years , which naturally has initiated a fresh round of controversy over what will serve as a replacement venue for the duration of renovations . Still , Berlin has weathered worse fights , and the most likely solution will be the reopening of the darkened Schiller Theatre \u2014 ironically situated in former West Berlin \u2014 which closed more than a decade ago due to budget pressures , against a background of noisy protest . It 's just one more example of how this idiosyncratic but alluring city may yet continue to produce the inventive responses to its lopsided history that in the long run can only benefit its fortunate inhabitants ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

The Batavierenrace is a relay race over 175 km from Nijmegen to Enschede , divided into 25 stages ( 16 men 's stages and 9 women 's stages ) varying from 3.6 km to 10.4 km . Over 350 teams participate in the race , which means more than 8,500 students . This has earned us a place in the Guinness Book of Records . The Batavierenrace is a mixture of a competitive sport-event as well as a big social event . At midnight on the 20th of April the race starts and the first runners will dive into the night for their heroic battle against the elements and the temptations of a warm bed . This is the beginning of 18 hours of sportsmanship . Afterwards , the biggest student party in Europe takes place , with over 12,000 visitors ! In brief : a great opportunity to be out with your team for a few days and be part of a fantastic event ! After a spectacular opening the race starts at midnight near the Radboud Sports Centre of Nijmegen . A unique feature of the Batavierenrace is that part of the race takes place during the night . To avoid overtaxing the route and to have a good registration of stage times , the start takes place in seven different start groups . There are also three restarts , to make sure the whole field of runners does not stretch out too far . These restarts take place in Ulft , Barchem , and Enschede ( Old Market ) . The participants of the race wear a runner 's vest which contains a chip that registers the stage times . Every runner is accompanied by a teammate by bike for navigation , safety and moral support . The route of the Batavierenrace leads the runners through crowded relay points as well as lonely windy country roads in the middle of nowhere . The Batavierenrace has its roots in Sweden . A couple of students from the Netherlands participated in the SOLA relay race in Sweden and decided to organize a similar event in the Netherlands . Inspired by the tribe of the Batavi , who sailed down the Rhine in 50 B.C. , they named their race the Batavierenrace . In 1973 the first edition was held , which led from Nijmegen to Rotterdam . Because of infrastructural problems they decided to change the route from ' Nijmegen - Rotterdam ' to ' Nijmegen - Enschede ' in 1974 , but maintained the name . Since 1974 , the route has barely changed . What did change is the number of participants : from 575 in 1973 to over 8500 in 2014 ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

As they learn from their predecessors ' mistakes , these new leaders may become even more lethal . Five new terrorist leaders have demonstrated their importance : Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys in Somalia , Abu Ayyub al - Masri in Iraq , Matiur Rehman and Faqir Mohammed in Pakistan , and Aris Sumarsono ( also known as Zulkarnaen ) in Indonesia . Even if these leaders prove short - lived , their decisions have already had a profound effect on the course of the global war on terror . They may represent disparate communities , but each of these new terrorist leaders employs similar strategies . First , they are more aware of their international image than their predecessors . While they seek to shock and strike fear into their enemies , they also wish to appear reasonable to their constituents and the larger Muslim population . While the Taliban engaged in massacres , and Zarqawi distributed videos showing the beheading of captives , the new leaders minimize overt acts of brutality that could undermine public support . Second , the new jihadists consider management of civil society more than did their predecessors . They do not wish to preside over failed states . The Islamic Courts Union ( ICU ) actually raised Somalia 's standard of living modestly . [ 1 ] Third , these new leaders have exploited advanced communications technologies to improve their outreach and forge broader alliances . It should not surprise that jihadist movements have grown stronger . Examination of each of their cases and areas of operation demonstrates how these new jihadist leaders have enacted these new strategies . Somalia : Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys On June 5 , 2006 , the fundamentalist Islamic Courts Union ( ICU ) seized Mogadishu and , over the next several months , consolidated control over the country 's other major cities . However , as they moved on Baidoa , the last bastion of the U.N. - recognized government , Ethiopian forces swept through the country , forcing the ICU from Mogadishu and other major cities . The Ethiopian government remained concerned about the ICU because its predecessor and major component , Al - Ittihad al - Islamiya ( AIAI ) , had sponsored Islamic separatist groups in the Ethiopian border province of Ogaden . [ 2 ] Nevertheless , the ICU 's brief success catapulted it into a model for other jihadist groups . Twice , Al - Qaeda deputy leader Ayman al - Zawahiri called for Islamic fighters to flock to Somalia to support the ICU . [ 3 ] Despite their routing , the ICU leadership survived the Ethiopian advance . ICU leader Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed has called for an insurgency , [ 4 ] and the U.N. 's Monitoring Group on Somalia has warned that \" the ICU is fully capable of turning Somalia into what is currently an Iraq - type scenario , replete with roadside and suicide bombers , assassinations , and other forms of terrorist and insurgent - type activities . \" [ 5 ] Already , there are initial signs that Ahmed 's threat is not empty . In early 2007 , ICU militants attacked African Union peacekeeping forces [ 6 ] and attempted to assassinate President Abdullahi Yusuf . [ 7 ] The man most likely to lead the insurgency is Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys . As a 42 - year - old Somali army colonel fighting in the 1977 war against Ethiopia , he won a medal for bravery . [ 8 ] He then worked to establish himself as a respected religious figure and also a political leader with considerable clout in Islamic extremist circles . In 1991 , Aweys cofounded and led AIAI , which sought to create an Islamic state in the Horn of Africa . [ 9 ] Then , starting in 2006 , he served as head of the ICU 's consultative council . In this capacity , he shaped ICU policies , which brought a strict version of Shari'a ( Islamic law ) to Somalia but in a manner that was more consistent with economic growth and civil society than previous jihadist attempts at imposing Islamic law . As the ICU gained power , Aweys pursued the three new jihadist strategies . First , he committed himself to winning over rather than alienating the Somali population . He sought to harness Islam , Somali nationalism , and Somalis ' distaste for the warlords ' rule . [ 10 ] The ICU portrayed itself as the only major faction in Somalia that upheld Islamic ideals . \" The Somalia people are a homogenous people having the same culture , same language , same religion , same sect also , \" Aweys told Newsweek in a rare interview . \" The only system they can accept to choose is Islam ; no one can force them to take another . \" [ 11 ] He exploited Somali nationalism by describing the Ethiopian government 's support for the transitional government as meddling in Somali affairs . He positioned the ICU as an alternative to the chaos and corruption of the warlords ' rule . His emphasis on stability and rule - of - law won the sympathy of the Somali business community , which , at the very least , welcomed the ICU 's strict rule as a means to reduce security outlays . [ 12 ] Although there are no reliable estimates as to how much the average businessman had to pay for security , the U.N. Monitoring Group 's late 2006 study on Somalia reports that checkpoints established by the warlords cost businesses several million dollars a year . [ 13 ] The ICU 's elimination of certain checkpoints that collected extortionate fees also reduced business expenses , in some cases by up to 50 percent of the delivery costs . [ 14 ] Second , Aweys ensured that the ICU minded its international image . It sought to diminish initial comparisons with the Taliban through restraint . Upon taking Kabul , the Taliban ransacked a U.N. compound , captured the former Afghan president sheltering inside , emasculated and hanged him . Widespread massacres marked the Taliban conquest of Mazar -i Sharif . In conquest , the ICU kept its subjugation relatively bloodless . As the ICU captured strategic Somali cities , there would often be little if any bloodshed . They often allowed the warlords who had earlier controlled the cities to escape . [ 15 ] Finally , the ICU worked to establish a broad - based jihadist coalition . A military intelligence source has confirmed a 2002 nongovernmental Partners International Foundation report that found sixteen operational terrorist training camps in Somalia . [ 16 ] In 2006 , the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia reported , \" Foreign volunteers ( fighters ) have also been arriving in considerable numbers to give added military strength to the ICU \u2026 Importantly , foreign volunteers also provide training in guerrilla warfare and special topics or techniques . \" [ 17 ] One senior ICU leader , Sheikh Hassan \" Turki \" Abdullah Hersi , openly admitted foreign involvement in Somalia during a speech to supporters after the seizure of Kismayo . \" Brothers in Islam , \" he said , \" We came from Mogadishu , and we have thousands of fighters , some are Somalis and others are from the Muslim world . \" [ 18 ] Iraq : Abu Ayyub al - Masri Abu Ayyub al - Masri is another trendsetter . When U.S. forces killed Zarqawi on June 7 , 2006 , some officials and analysts said Al - Qaeda in Iraq was in trouble . Iraqi national security advisor Mowaffak al - Rubaie , for example , said , \" Al - Qaeda is on the run now in Iraq , and this is the beginning of the end of Al - Qaeda in Iraq . \" [ 19 ] Al - Masri proved such statements hollow . He is a more effective leader than Zarqawi . Under Al - Masri 's leadership , Al - Qaeda in Iraq has been able to repair its damaged reputation and has formed a broader alliance with other Iraqi jihadists . Al - Masri was born in Egypt around 1967 . Under the tutelage of Zawahiri , he joined Al - Jihad al - Islami al - Misri ( Egyptian Islamic Jihad ) in 1982 . [ 20 ] After the Egyptian government began a crackdown that lasted through much of the 1980s , he took refuge in Sudan and , in 1995 , moved to Pakistan . [ 21 ] When Al - Qaeda incorporated Zawahiri 's group in mid-2001 , [ 22 ] Al - Masri traveled to Afghanistan and trained at the bin Laden-sponsored Al - Faruq training camp . [ 23 ] He met Zarqawi there in 2001 [ 24 ] and also became an expert at assembling bombs . [ 25 ] Al - Masri traveled to Iraq in 2002 , before liberation , and helped establish the Baghdad area 's first Al - Qaeda cell . [ 26 ] After the U.S. invasion , Al - Masri provided logistical support to Al - Qaeda in Iraq and helped Zarqawi run the pipeline of foreign fighters . [ 27 ] Al - Masri 's effectiveness is highlighted by comparison to his predecessor . It is true that Zarqawi captured the imagination of many people throughout the Middle East , [ 28 ] but he was also a ruthless killer . His videotapes showed the beheadings not only of Westerners but also of Iraqis . Such brutality turned many Iraqis against the group and opened a rift between Zarqawi 's foreign fighters and Iraqi insurgents . This fact was not lost on Al - Qaeda 's central leadership . Zawahiri sent Zarqawi a letter in July 2005 that urged him to curtail his brutal tactics : Among the things which the feelings of the Muslim populace who love and support you will never find palatable \u2014 also \u2014 are the scenes of slaughtering the hostages . You should n't be deceived by the praise of some of the zealous young men and their description of you as the shaykh of the slaughterers , etc . They do not express the general view of the admirer and the supporter of the resistance in Iraq , and of you in particular by the favor and blessing of God \u2026 We would spare the people from the effect of questions about the usefulness of our actions in the hearts and minds of the general opinion that is essentially sympathetic to us . [ 29 ] Zawahiri 's objection to Zarqawi 's actions was more strategic than moral . He implored Zarqawi simply to shoot his captives . [ 30 ] Al - Masri has taken Al - Qaeda in Iraq in a different direction . On one hand , he has worked to build a coalition of insurgent groups and has sought to incorporate Iraqi tribes under his banner . In essence , he is trying to \" Iraqify \" Al - Qaeda . [ 31 ] On the other hand , he has reached out to a broader range of jihadist groups . In an audiotape released just after the November 7 , 2006 U.S. elections , he urged a more united front to destabilize the Iraqi government : O you the commanders of Al - Ansar and Al - Mujahidin army , and the rest of the faithful ones . Our yearning for you has increased , and we are longing for your amity . Your brothers pray to God to protect you \u2026 We are not better than you so that we come forward while you step back . You have started jihad before us , you are more disinterest [ ed ] in leadership than us , and your soldiers are more obedient . We consider you to be more faithful to God in your religion . [ 32 ] While Zarqawi would label as enemies all Muslims who did not support his mission , Al - Masri urges other jihadists to \" take care of our Sunni kinsfolk \" and to \" leniently call for the good and preach against evil especially since the infidel Baath Party had confused the people vis -\u00e0-vis their religion . \" [ 33 ] Al - Masri 's strategy is designed to accomplish two of the new generation of jihadists ' objectives . While U.S. forces prevent Al - Masri from controlling territory and therefore running mechanisms of state , he now avoids alienating Iraqi civil society while creating a larger jihadist front . Pakistan : Matiur Rehman Pakistan is central to Al - Qaeda 's war against the West . Al - Qaeda and its allies largely relocated to Pakistan after the 2001 U.S. military occupation of Afghanistan . This has caused changes in the Al - Qaeda organization . The group 's foot soldiers previously were predominantly Arab ; today , they are largely Pakistani . Al - Qaeda has made strategic gains in Pakistan , most notably the September 5 , 2006 Waziristan accord , in which the Pakistani government essentially ceded the Waziristan region of Pakistan 's North - West Frontier Province to the Taliban and Al - Qaeda . [ 34 ] This safe haven is problematic for U.S. national security . As the 9 - 11 Commission reported , one of the key elements in planning a catastrophic terrorist attack is a sanctuary that provides \" time , space , and ability to perform competent planning and staff work . \" [ 35 ] No one has benefited from this accord more than Metiur Rehman , a Punjabi from Pakistan born around 1976 . [ 36 ] While Rehman may be unknown in the West to all but professional terrorism and intelligence analysts , he may be the man most likely to plan the next attack on the United States . [ 37 ] Analysts believe that Rehman became an expert in explosives in the mid-1990s . Soon after , he became an instructor in Al - Qaeda 's camps , focusing his efforts on recruits visiting from the West . [ 38 ] He became deputy to Amjand Farooqi , leader of Harakut ul Ansar , one of the most violent Kashmiri terrorist groups . [ 39 ] Both are suspected in the kidnapping and beheading of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl . After Pakistani police killed Farooqi in 2004 , Rehman remained in sole possession of the database of all Pakistanis trained in Al - Qaeda camps . Rehman is now the chief liaison between Al - Qaeda and Pakistan 's jihadists . He is linked to many of the assassination attempts against Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf between 2003 and 2006 [ 40 ] and is also a suspect in the plot to bomb several airliners over the Atlantic in August 2006 . [ 41 ] Unlike Aweys and Masri , he focuses more on terrorist operations than on organizing a broad - based movement . Still , he is willing to exploit local civil society to his goals , a task made easier by the shift in Pakistani public opinion against President Musharraf and the United States . [ 42 ] Pakistan : Faqir Mohammed The Waziristan accord has also indirectly strengthened Faqir Mohammad . Born around 1970 in Chopatra , a village in the Bajaur province about 20 kilometers from the Afghan - Pakistan border , he studied religion until age twenty under the prominent Salafi imam Maulana Abdus Salam and , later , at the Darul - Uloom Pamjpeer , a local madrasa ( Islamic school ) . His Salafi education prompted him to embrace the Afghan Arabs , jihadists from the Persian Gulf states who flocked to Afghanistan in the 1980s to fight the Soviets . Faqir Mohammed became a jihadist in 1993 under the tutelage of Maulana Sufi Mohammad , an active leader in Jamat-e-Islami , a Pakistani Islamic movement allegedly linked to terrorist groups . Thereafter , Mohammed fought in Afghanistan with the Taliban . [ 43 ] Faqir Mohammed continued to fight in Afghanistan even after the Taliban 's fall , but he also established a base in Pakistan . A strategic marriage allowed Mohammed to establish himself in the Mamoond tribe in the North - West Frontier Province 's Bajaur district . This has enabled him to provide Al - Qaeda with a local safe haven . In January 2005 , the Central Intelligence Agency fingered his house in Bajaur as Al - Qaeda 's winter headquarters . [ 44 ] On October 30 , 2006 , U.S. forces staged an air strike on a madrasa in a Bajaur tribal village that also allegedly served as an Al - Qaeda training camp . Faqir Mohammed felt so confident , however , that he gave an interview near the scene of the destroyed school [ 45 ] and , later , attended and even spoke at the funeral for the eighty people who died in the attack . Mohammed 's role is important . He controls a strategic area from which his forces stage cross - border raids on NATO forces in Afghanistan . [ 46 ] The new jihadist leaders increasingly focus on establishing pure Islamic \" emirates \" to serve as stepping stones toward a greater caliphate , which they seek . Figures such as Faqir Mohammed are central to this strategy because they provide a link between Al - Qaeda and local tribes . They can mitigate ethnic tensions which otherwise might undercut Al - Qaeda 's effectiveness . Also consistent with the new jihadist strategy , Mohammed has not sought to overturn the tribes ' civil society in Pakistan . Instead , he works within the existing tribal structure , trying to carve out a place for Al - Qaeda within it . This approach is more likely to engender long - term success than past jihadist efforts to completely remake the societies in which they operated . Indonesia : Aris Sumarsono Another new generation jihadist leader focuses upon Indonesia , the country with the largest Muslim population in the world . Aris Sumarsono , also known as Zulkarnaen , was born in 1963 in central Java , Indonesia . [ 47 ] He became Jemaah Islamiya 's chief of military operations in February 2004 after the arrest of his predecessor [ 48 ] and now sits on Al - Qaeda 's main decision - making council . [ 49 ] He is well - connected with access to thousands of potential operatives and cultivates an image of humility , innocence , and self - restraint that many Southeast Asian Muslims find appealing . As a young man , he reportedly studied at an Islamic boarding school , Al - Mumkin , founded by Abdullah Sungkar . [ 50 ] Sungkar , along with Abu Bakar Bashir , founded Jemaah Islamiya , an Islamic terrorist group that seeks establishment of an Islamic state across southeast Asia . [ 51 ] In the late 1980s , Sungkar sent a group of his best students , including Zulkarnaen , to Afghanistan to train with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf , a Saudi-financed Afghan mujahideen leader . [ 52 ] Zulkarnaen became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Muhammad Sauwki al - Istambuli , an Egyptian terrorist leader . [ 53 ] Zulkarnaen stayed in Afghanistan for a decade , developed an expertise in sabotage , and trained other Jemaah Islamiya members . [ 54 ] Sydney Jones , an expert on Jemaah Islamiya and director of the Jakarta branch of the International Crisis Group , said that while in Afghanistan , Zulkarnaen was likely drawn to the writings of jihadist ideologue Abdullah Azzam , [ 55 ] whose teachings focused on fighting against foreign powers ' encroachment into Muslim lands . [ 56 ] Zulkarnaen continued his Jemaah Islamiya training and recruitment efforts after he returned to southeast Asia in the 1990s . [ 57 ] He helped establish training camps in areas of the Philippines controlled by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front similar to those that existed under the Taliban in Afghanistan . [ 58 ] It was in one such Philippines camp that Mohammed Sidique Khan , a participant in the July 7 , 2005 London transportation system attacks , learned bomb-making . [ 59 ] Zulkarnaen is suspected in several major terrorist attacks . He allegedly helped prepare the explosives used in the 2002 Bali disco bombing which killed 202 people , including eighty - eight Australians , and is also a suspect in the August 5 , 2003 car bomb attack on the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta . [ 60 ] Today , analysts consider him to be Indonesia 's most dangerous terrorist . [ 61 ] Beneath Zulkarnaen 's quiet demeanor is a devotee to violent international jihad . Like Rehman , Zulkarnaen 's connections make him a formidable opponent . Conclusion The upcoming generation of terrorist leaders is not amateur . They all have formal military training . They no longer accept the idea that brutality is romantic but rather seek to strike a balance between effectiveness and piety . They no longer assume that Muslims will flock to a strict Shari 'a state and , consequently , also tap into nationalist sentiments , even while striving toward a goal that would mean an end to the nation-state . Nevertheless , despite their strategic embrace of national identity , the new jihadist leaders recognize the importance of transnational links and alliances . The strategic characteristics of these new jihadist leaders fit well with the direction that Al - Qaeda 's central leadership is taking . Local Al - Qaeda leaders and affiliated groups have managed to maintain semiautonomous control over their individual organizations while still reporting to the terrorist group 's central leadership . As a senior military intelligence officer put it : We 're seeing much more of a subsidiarization of terrorist groups , which has now become much more pronounced . Call it Al - Qaeda federalism . You have strong local leaders , but they are all held accountable to a strong central leadership . This creates a hydra-like effect . If you look at these nodes being established , they are all able to survive absent this central leadership . This is a big risk for the central leadership because they could break off . However , these groups remain wedded to the central leadership , and it thus creates a strong network . [ 62 ] Meanwhile , the central Al - Qaeda organization can sense that some of its long - term goals may be within reach for the first time . Al - Qaeda has long sought to reestablish the caliphate . [ 63 ] Now , the terrorist group 's growing regional strength makes the caliphate seem like a more reasonable goal since the Islamic emirates that are currently taking shape could form the basis of an eventual caliphate . As a new generation of jihadist leaders shifts tactics in pursuit of a long - term vision , U.S. and Western officials counter the threat with disjointed , short - term strategies . The assumptions long held by Western counterterrorism officials about expansionist terrorist groups may no longer be true . With jihadists devoting greater attention to image , to managing civil society , and to broadening their outreach , states that fall to the jihadists may no longer fail . To the contrary , in Somalia , living standards increased when the Islamic Courts Union briefly restored public security . In order to counter Al - Qaeda 's new generation , Western officials should concentrate on twin goals . First , they should prevent terrorist safe havens from arising in the first place \u2014 a goal that was endorsed by the 9 - 11 Commission . [ 64 ] And , second , they need to prove that U.S. allies and their aid organizations are as adept at building a stable civil society as the jihadists . A large number of Somali citizens looked favorably upon the ICU when it gained power because it provided an alternative to the chaos that had prevailed before . Yet , after supporting a military intervention to topple the ICU , Washington has failed to provide the aid needed to allow Somalia 's transitional federal government to thrive .

Questions remain , however , over the future of the site which was earmarked for the new town of Northstowe . The land is owned jointly by the Homes and Communities Agency and private developer , Gallagher Longstanton Ltd. Paul Kitson from the agency said they would \" look at ways that the local community could benefit from the site \" . The centre was established as an immigration fast -track facility at Oakington Barracks in 2000 . The former RAF station is based in the village of Longstanton , and comprises both the barracks and a disused airfield . Many of the mature trees on the site will remain when development starts Northstowe The Homes and Communities Agency ( HCA ) , which is the government 's housing and regeneration agency , has a remit to work closely with local authorities to provide more affordable housing and to develop brownfield sites such as Oakington 's barracks and airfield . Together with Gallagher , they submitted an outline planning application for the development of Northstowe to South Cambridgeshire District Council in December 2007 . The new town was to have 9,500 houses , a school , retail facilities , community buildings , and perhaps most importantly , good transport links that included the guided busway to encourage the use of public transport and take the pressure off the local roads and the A14 . We want to get the best use out of the site between now and when Northstowe proper happens Paul Kitson , Homes and Communities Agency The guided busway has yet to open , and the initial plans for Northstowe have not been approved . With an amended application expected in 2011 , residents in the village of Longstanton have expressed concern about about how the area will be used , and kept secure , now that the Home Office has closed the immigration facility . Mick Yarrow is the chairman of Longstanton Parish Council and owns the only shop in the village - a Post Office and general store . He said : \" My business will suffer because we used to deliver papers to the centre and many of the employees used my shop . But I 'm also concerned that some of the local people will now be unemployed . \" Squatters Mr Yarrow also said he was worried about security at the site , and whether travellers or squatters might move into the unused buildings . The HCA 's area manager , Paul Kitson , was quick to allay fears . He said : \" On 12 November when the entire site comes under our control , there are three issues that we want to address . An artist 's impression of part of the proposed town of Northstowe \" First , that we pay heed to our neighbours and make sure that the site is safe and secure . We 'll be maintaining the same level of security as was on site when it was run by the Home Office , in addition to the security we already have on the airfield . \" Secondly , we 'll be looking to reduce our operating costs and there 's the health and safety consideration too , as many of these buildings are old and substantial , and we 'll probably be looking at removing some of them to help reduce costs . \" Lastly , he said that both the HCA and Gallagher were committed to making sure that the local community could make use of the facilities that exist on the site . \" That might involve talking with local parish councils , it might involve using the playing field at the front of the site or part-use of some of the buildings if they 're in the right condition . \" We want to get the best use out of the site between now and when Northstowe proper happens , \" he said . ' Assets ' Both the HCA and Gallagher are adamant that Northstowe will be approved and built , and that development of the first phase can begin as soon as possible . Paul Kitson was keen to point out that many of the buildings already there would be retained . He said : \" One of the key features of the masterplan was to keep the street layout of the barracks . \" He added that buildings including the officers ' mess , administration block and the guard house would \" really contribute to the sense of place that new developments sometimes lack \" and should be retained as a reference to the area 's heritage . By keeping these buildings , when or if , Northstowe is developed , there will already be some large community spaces ready for use , unlike Cambourne , for example , where houses were built first and community facilities followed much later . Mr Kitson said that he was also mindful of the environmental impact of developing the site at Longstanton . The officers ' mess is one of the buildings that developers want to keep \" Brownfield sites like this , when left undeveloped , become very rich in biodiversity and we have a number of owl and bat species , badgers , reptiles and lizards that are a real asset to this area . \" We 'll be paying close attention to the translocation , movement and mitigation measures for those species over the next few months , \" he said . \" Tree retention has always been a big issue throughout the planning for Northstowe . The lovely mature trees down the avenue on the barrack site are also a real asset as it 's very difficult to buy that sort of scene-setting . \" Parts of the airfield are also leased to local farmers , and agricultural tenancy is something we 'd like to increase , \" he said . \" The more people you 've got there , the more secure an area is . \" While he admitted that the rejection of proposals to expand the A14 had been disappointing for Northstowe , Mr Kitson said : \" We 're working with the Highways Agency and the Department of Transport to understand what the constraints are on any development in relation to the A14 . \""},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

CANDU is the Canadian heavy water nuclear reactor . ( H\/T David Walters DUPIC Costs The extra cost of DUPIC has been estimated to be six to ten percent above the once - through cost . This is far below credible estimates for the cost of the fast - reactor fuel cycle , which started at 25 percent above once - through . Moreover , there are many CANDU reactors operating around the world , with excellent in - service records . Their operating costs are well known , and competitive with those of light water reactors . DUPIC Advantages and Technical Issues The DUPIC technique has certain advantages : No materials are separated during the refabrication process . Uranium , plutonium , fission products and minor actinides are kept together in the fuel powder and bound together again in the DUPIC fuel bundles . * A high net destruction rate can be achieved of actinides and plutonium . * Up to 25 % more energy can be realised compared to other PWR used fuel recycling techniques . * And a DUPIC fuel cycle could reduce a country\u00b9s need for used PWR fuel disposal by 70 % while reducing fresh uranium requirements by 30 % . Used nuclear fuel is highly radioactive and generates heat . This high activity means that the DUPIC manufacture process must be carried out remotely behind heavy shielding . While these restrictions make the diversion of fissile materials much more difficult and hence increase security , they also make the manufacture process more complex compared with that for the original PWR fuel , which is barely radioactive before use . Canada , which developed the CANDU reactor , and South Korea , which hosts four CANDU units as well as many PWRs , have initiated a bilateral joint research program to develop DUPIC and the Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute ( KAERI ) has been implementing a comprehensive development program since 1992 to demonstrate the DUPIC fuel cycle concept . KAERI believes that although it is too early to commercialise the DUPIC fuel cycle , the key technologies are in place for a practical demonstration of the technique . Challenges which remain include the development of a technology to produce fuel pellets of the correct density , the development of remote fabrication equipment and the handling of the used PWR fuel . However , KAERI successfully manufactured DUPIC small fuel elements for irradiation tests inside the HANARO research reactor in April 2000 and fabricated full - size DUPIC elements in February 2001 . AECL is also able to manufacture DUPIC fuel elements . Research is also underway on the reactor physics of DUPIC fuel and the impacts on safety systems . A further complication is the loading of highly radioactive DUPIC fuel into the CANDU reactor . Normal fuel handling systems are designed for the fuel to be hot and highly radioactive only after use , but it is thought that the used fuel path from the reactor to cooling pond could be reversed in order to load DUPIC fuel , and studies of South Korea 's Wolsong CANDU units indicate that both the front - and rear-loading techniques could be used with some plant modification . Used fuel from light water reactors ( at normal US burn - up levels ) contains approximately : 95.6 % uranium ( U-232 : 0.1-0.3 % ; U-234 : 0.1-0.3 % ; U-235 : 0.5-1.0 % ; U-236 : 4 - 0.7 % ; balance : U -238 ) 2.9 % stable fission products 0.9 % plutonium 0.3 % caesium & strontium ( fission products ) 0.1 % iodine and technetium ( fission products ) 0.1 % other long - lived fission products 0.1 % minor actinides ( americium , curium , neptunium ) South Korea Nuclear Power South Korea is now moving toward a full 60 % of electricity capacity from Nuclear power ( versus 40 % now ) , which could put them close to 75 % of real generation . They have now 5 1 GW - plus reactors under construction and 3 more planned to start over the next 5 years . These 3 including the last one that was started in the fall of last year , is the APR - 1400 , a 1350 MW ingeniously built , partially Korean designed nuclear power plant based on a Generation III + reactor originally conceived by , but never implement by , Westinghouse on a NRC approved design known as \u201c System 80 + \u201d . The Koreans are also working on advanced reprocessing facilities to recover the 97 % of the energy that sits in spent nuclear fuel facilities . DUPIC Status Report from 2006 6 page DUPIC status report from 2006 The Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute ( KAERI ) established the DUPIC fuel development facility ( DFDF ) in 1999 to process the PWR spent fuel and to fabricate the DUPIC fuel on a laboratory scale . In this facility , about 25 pieces of fuel fabrication equipment are installed . ( Lab scale facility ) 1 ) Decladding machine , OREOX furnace , off - gas treatment system , attrition mill and mixer to produce DUPIC fuel powder from the PWR spent fuel 2 ) Compaction press , high temperature sintering furnace , center - less grinder , pellet cleaner and dryer , pellet stack length adjuster and pellet loader to fabricate DUPIC fuel pellets 3 ) Remote laser welder and welding chamber to fabricate DUPIC fuel elements 4 ) Quality inspection devices to characterize the DUPIC fuel powder , pellets and elements . KAERI fabricated real size DUPIC fuel elements in February 2001 . A comparison of the optical microscopy photos showed that the irradiation behavior of the DUPIC fuel is similar to that of the standard CANDU spent fuel or PWR spent fuel of 40000 MWd \/ tHM . The engineering - scale DUPIC facility will be designed with a capacity of 50 ton \/ yr and a plant lifetime of 40 yrs . The design also considers the expansion of the facility to a commercial - scale plant . The main process building is located in the centre , surrounded by auxiliary buildings such as a utility facility , health physics buildings , etc . The overall process can be categorized into a DUPIC fuel fabrication , a structural part recycling and a radioactive waste treatment . A detailed flow path of the main processes is as follows : \u2013 PWR spent fuel receiving and storage \u2013 Spent fuel disassembly and decladding ( 99 % recovery of the fuel material from the clad ) \u2013 Fuel powder preparation by the OREOX process \u2013 Fuel pellet fabrication with a theoretical density of more than 95 % \u2013 Fuel rod fabrication including a surface decontamination and fissile content measurement . \u2013 Fuel bundle fabrication in the CANFLEX geometry . Though it is yet too early to launch the commercialization of the DUPIC fuel based on the basic DUPIC fuel technologies developed until now , it is also true that the key technologies have been developed for the DUPIC fuel cycle . Therefore it is expected that there should be no technical problems to develop the commercial DUPIC fuel technology once the DUPIC fuel technology and its performance are demonstrated through a practical use of the DUPIC fuel , which will be an extremely important turning point in the history of nuclear power development . By utilizing spent fuel by an internationally - proven proliferation - resistant technology , it is expected that the burden of a spent fuel accumulation will be relieved not only in the domestic nuclear grid but also in the worldwide nuclear power industry . Electrolytic \/ electrometallurgical processing techniques ( ' pyroprocessing ' ) to separate nuclides from a radioactive waste stream have been under development in the US Department of Energy laboratories , notably Argonne , as well as by the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute ( KAERI ) in conjunction with work on DUPIC The KAERI advanced spent fuel conditioning process ( ACP ) involves separating uranium , transuranics including plutonium , and fission products including lanthanides . It utilises a high - temperature lithium - potassium cathode . Development of this process is at the heart of US - South Korean nuclear cooperation , and will be central to the renewal of the bilateral US - South Korean nuclear cooperation agreement in 2014 , so is already receiving considerable attention in negotiations . With US assistance through the International Nuclear Energy Research Initiative ( I-NERI ) program KAERI built the Advanced Spent Fuel Conditioning Process Facility ( ACPF ) at KAERI in 2005 . KAERI hopes the project will be expanded to engineering scale by 2012 , leading to the first stage of a Korea Advanced Pyroprocessing Facility ( KAPF ) starting in 2016 and becoming a commercial - scale demonstration plant in 2025 FURTHER READING Older 6 page report on Korea 's DUPIC plans Canada nuclear yearbook for 2008 . 54 pages Brian Wang is a Futurist Thought Leader and a popular Science blogger with 1 million readers per month .

These methods are to ensure that you are really at the address you claim to be at for the purposes of sending your marketing pitches . In many cases , the consequence of that confirmation is a stream of messages and newsletters that you most likely do n't want .

This service is free and allows you to set up an account where you specify the address the disposable address is to be relayed to and a username ( for example , \u201c nospamtome \u201d ) . For a specific disposable address you pick a keyword ( for example \u201c PhoenixUniversity \u201d ) and the number of messages the disposable account can receive ( say , 10 ; 20 is the maximum ) . These parameters become part of a disposable address such as : phoenixuniversity.10.nospamtome@spamgourmet.com The next 10 messages sent to that address will be routed to your real address after which the disposable address will return bounces .

Andrew Blake-Herbert , Strategic Director of Resources for Slough Borough Council , said : \u201c This approval gives us the go ahead to make Heart of Slough a reality . We 're committed to making Slough a great place to live , work and play . Heart of Slough is critical to that commitment . It will breathe new life into the town and give us another reason why we can be Proud to be Slough . \u201d The Heart of Slough project will be delivered by Slough Borough Council , the Homes and Communities Agency , and Development Securities . It will bring new homes , offices , hotels , retail and community facilities to the centre of Slough . One of the most iconic changes will see the replacement of the existing Brunel bus station with a sleek modern design by Matthew Bedward of Bblur architects . The model for the bus station has already attracted the interest of the Royal Academy , which shortlisted it for the 2009 summer exhibition . Another landmark building will be the Learning Curve , which will be the home for the new central library , adult learning and cultural activities . The impressive glass fronted building has been designed to reflect and complement St Ethelbert 's church , reinforcing the church 's position as an important focal point for the town . The bus station is due for completion in early 2011 , and the Learning Curve will be completed during 2012 . Other parts of the project will take longer . Andrew Blake - Herbert explained : \u201c Only once the Learning Curve is complete and library services are up and running will the existing library be removed to make way for a new complex of shops , hotels and cafes . In the same meeting , the planning committee also approved the detailed plans for a new road layout to replace the existing Brunel roundabout . Incorporating interlinked traffic lights that communicate with each other , the new layout promises to improve traffic flow at this busy junction . The removal of the roundabout will also free up wasted space , providing room for more open public spaces such as a plaza area around the church . \u201c We want to make Slough much easier to use by pedestrians and people who want to use public transport , \u201d said Andrew Blake -Herbert . \u201c So we 're providing open spaces for pedestrians and carefully placing pedestrian crossings to provide a natural and safe route between the bus and the railway stations and the town centre . \u201d The highways work will be funded by the Homes and Communities Agency ( HCA ) , the national housing and regeneration agency for England . David Ashworth , South East Head of Area for the Homes and Communities Agency said : \u201c We are delighted to have secured planning approval for the Heart of Slough project and look forward to working with Slough Borough Council and Development Securities to deliver the scheme . \u201d Development Securities will be providing office accommodation to attract new organisations into the town , building on Slough 's reputation as a location of choice for the European HQs of some of Europe 's most famous names . Simon Hesketh , Development Director at Development Securities said : \u201c The approval of the masterplan for Heart of Slough is the culmination of many years of close collaboration between Slough Borough Council , the HCA and us . We are all immensely proud to have achieved this milestone , and excited that the partnership can now commence the implementation phase . \u201d This timely decision follows the publication of Regeneration and the Recession , an all party Whitehall report released on 30 June , which encourages councils to work more closely with private sector partners and the HCA to ensure regeneration continues during recession . Andrew Blake-Herbert , said : \u201c Slough Borough Council is continuing to invest in the town during this difficult economic period . We 've planned for this for a long time and the project is affordable , deliverable and inspirational . \u201d Last published 14 July 2009 To search the archive , enter your criteria below .

N\u00e5 er hun d\u00f8mt til d\u00f8den for utuktig omgang med menn . Amnesty International g\u00e5r i forb\u00f8nn for henne . - Forf > - < forf > per A. Christiansen < Tragedie . Da hun var \u00e5tte \u00e5r gammel , ble tvunget ut i prostitusjon av sin mor . Senere har familien to ganger solgt henne til eldre menn som har leid henne ut til horekunder . Til sammen har hun f\u00f8dt tre barn , det f\u00f8rste da hun var ni \u00e5r gammel . N\u00e5 er hun d\u00f8mt til d\u00f8den av en iransk domstol . Hennes mentale alder er fortsatt \u00e5tte \u00e5r . Slik beskriver Amnesty International skjebnen til en n\u00e5 19 \u00e5r gammel iransk jente organisasjonen omtaler som Leyla M. Opplysningene bygger p\u00e5 meldinger i iransk presse . D\u00f8dsdommen m\u00e5 godkjennes av Irans h\u00f8yesterett , og Amnesty har satt i gang en aksjon for \u00e5 f\u00e5 den omgjort . D\u00f8dsdommen Leyla M. h\u00f8rer hjemme i industribyen Arak , omkring 30 mil s\u00f8rvest for Teheran . Det var her hun i en alder av 18 \u00e5r ble d\u00f8mt til d\u00f8den for bordellvirksomhet , for seksuell omgang med n\u00e6r familie og for \u00e5 ha f\u00f8dt barn utenfor ekteskap . If\u00f8lge dommen skal hun piskes f\u00f8r henrettelsen finner sted . If\u00f8lge iransk presse har sosialarbeidere flere ganger foretatt en mentalunders \u00f8kelse av Leyla M. Hver gang har de kommet til at hennes mentale alder er \u00e5tte \u00e5r . Disse resultatene skal ikke v\u00e6re fremlagt for domstolen , som \u00e5penbart kun har tatt hensyn til hennes tilst\u00e5else . Hittil i \u00e5r har Iran henrettet tre barn . Dertil d\u00f8de en 14 \u00e5r gammel gutt da han den 12 . november ble straffet med 85 piskeslag for \u00e5 ha spist mat p\u00e5 offentlig sted i fastem\u00e5neden Ramadan . Ved siden av USA er Iran n\u00e5 praktisk talt det eneste land som henretter mennesker for forbrytelser de har beg\u00e5tt f\u00f8r de har fylt 18 \u00e5r . Parallell D\u00f8dsdommen over Leyla M minner p\u00e5 mange m\u00e5ter om saken mot en annen ten\u00e5ring , Atefeh Rajabi ( ogs\u00e5 omtalt som Ateqeh Rajabi ) . Hun var 16 \u00e5r da hun den 15 . august i \u00e5r ble henrettet ved offentlig hengning i byen Neka n\u00e6r Det kaspiske hav . Ogs\u00e5 hun var gjennom nesten hele sitt liv blitt utsatt for vold og tortur , og utnyttet seksuelt b\u00e5de av sin egen familie og av fremmede . Hun ble kjent skyldig i \u00e5 ha hatt gjentatte samleier med ugifte menn , etter at hun f\u00f8rst fem ganger var d\u00f8mt til piskestraffer for de samme forholdene , f\u00f8rste gang da hun var 14 \u00e5r .. Den iransk-norske legen og menneskerettighetsaktivisten Mahmood Amiry -Moghaddam , som arbeider ved Universitetet i Oslo , p\u00e5pekte den gang overfor Aftenposten at den 16 \u00e5r gamle jenta etter alt \u00e5 d\u00f8mme var i psykisk ubalanse , at hun kom fra en fattig og ressurssvak familie og at hun under rettssaken ikke hadde noen form for juridisk bistand . If\u00f8lge andre rapporter la dommeren personlig l\u00f8kken rundt den d\u00f8dsd\u00f8mtes hals f\u00f8r hun ble f\u00f8rt gjennom byen til galgen . En iransk advokat som representerer den henrettedes familie , forbereder n\u00e5 en sak mot dommeren . If\u00f8lge avisen The Independent har advokaten dokumenter som viser at den tiltalte var mentalt syk , slik at hennes tilst\u00e5else ikke kunne brukes i retten . Amnesty fors\u00f8ker n\u00e5 \u00e5 hindre at ogs \u00e5 Leyla M. henrettes , og ber folk sende appeller til iranske myndigheter .

Aired on SpikeTV I had night class \u00e2til 9 pm , so I\u00e2m here for the last hour - and - a- half or so of Impact . Some of the previous results , courtesy of prowrestling .net : - The show started with Mick Foley and Abyss in the ring , and Foley booked him and Abyss against Dr. Stevie and Raven for later on . - Kurt Angle and AJ Styles were interviewed backstage - they tag up later tonight . There was some tension between the two . 1 - Amazing Red beat Scott Steiner by DQ when Steiner used a lead pipe . [ Commercial Break ] - I picked things up with Jeremy Borash backstage with Kevin Nash and Eric Young . He asked Nash about the answers Nash alluded to at Turning Point . Nash said the title isn\u00e2t the former Legends belt , but it\u00e2s Eric Young\u00e2s Global Championship belt . He said he wants to party with Young since EY out - thought him at Turning Point . He said he knew a guy like EY , and he tagged together with him at one point , making a lot of history ( and money ) . Nash proposed teamwork between the two . Young wanted time to think about it . \u00e2 TNA , welcome to our world\u00e2 said Young . Nash promised Foley answers by the end of the night . 2 - THE MOTOR CITY MACHINE GUNS & BEER MONEY vs. THE BRITISH INVASION & KIYOSHI & SHEIK ABDUL BASHIR Earl Hebner warned Eric Young , who was on commentary joined by Kevin Nash , that if he got up out of the chair , the World Elite would be DQ\u00e2ed . The Machine Guns double - teamed Kiyoshi and Shelley got a quick cover . Kiyoshi took over and tagged Bashir . Sabin and Magnus both tagged in at the same time and Sabin was all offense . Flying forearm in the corner , then a springboard clothesline . All three heels interfered to break it up . The faces came in to stave them off . The Machine Guns did some teamwork to take Magnus out of the ring . Double-suplex by Beer Money on Kiyoshi on the ramp . They went after Young and Nash as Rob Terry got in the ring . Magnus held Sabin for him , but Sabin ducked and Terry clotheslined Magnus by accident . No DQ for that , even though the interference backfired ? Shelley ended up pinning Magnus after the Machine Guns finished him off . \u00e2 He can\u00e2t do anything right , \u00e2 exclaimed Young about Terry . WINNERS : The Guns and Beer Money , at 5:19 . Fine match that planted the seeds for a Beer Money vs. EY and Nash feud . [ Commercial Break - mid-break , Tenay and Taz said Foley was backstage looking for Nash . ] - Foley caught up to Nash backstage . Foley had a patch over his left eye . He said everyone knows Nash is Hogan\u00e2s boy . Nash was offended that Foley called him someone\u00e2s \u00e2boy . \u00e2 All he meant , Foley said , was that he knows what Hogan\u00e2s up to . Nash asked why Foley was so paranoid . Nash said he\u00e2s out some money , and if Foley gets him his money back , he\u00e2ll get the answers . And when Hulk comes back , he\u00e2s not coming alone . Foley wanted to know what that meant , but Nash just walked away . - We got a video package on Hogan\u00e2s press conference with Dixie Carter . At a book signing , a fan told Hogan he wasn\u00e2t even going to watch wrestling on Monday nights again . [ Commercial Break ] - Abyss was in Foley\u00e2s office , begging to get his hands on Dr. Stevie and Raven . He noted Foley\u00e2s eye-patch and Foley said at least if he goes blind , it\u00e2ll be easier to apply for a TNA referee\u00e2s job . Foley showed off his latest Tweet \u00e2n Tweak Connection photo . Foley was laughing heartily about his eye damage possibly being permanent , but then he got angry and said that\u00e2s why he\u00e2s going to do what he\u00e2s got to do tonight . Abyss said he\u00e2s spent his life exacting revenge on those who have caused him pain and suffering , but he tried to convince Foley that Mick isn\u00e2t ready to go out there to compete tonight . Foley said the choice is his . Abyss said everyone has choices to make and Foley seemed bitter that Dixie Carter made the choice not to inform him of the Hogan signing . More schizophrenia from Foley . 3 - HAMADA vs. TAYLOR WILDE Crowd seemed to be into Hamada early on . Some chain wrestling by the ladies to start , and Hamada ended that by planting Wilde with a DDT for two . Wilde flipped out of a suplex and got a two after a kick to the head . Savate kick by Hamada and a beauty . Moonsault got two for the Japanese import . Powerbomb reversed into a sunset flip by Wilde for two . Hurricanrana into a pin for two as well . Enziguiri by Hamada . Lots of high impact moves , but hardly any selling . Perfect example , Wilde immediately reversed a Hamada driver . Spin kick by Hamada , then a Hamada Driver for the win . WINNER : Hamada , at 2:49 . Everything was hit solidly and nothing was missed , but the moves lose their impact when there is hardly any selling and they go right to a reversal . - Outside Foley\u00e2s office , Abyss cleared off a desk and moved it in front of Foley\u00e2s office door to block it and keep Foley in . [ Commercial Break - Daffney gave Dr. Stevie and Raven some words of encouragement backstage before they came out to the Impact Zone . ] - A short Hogan interview talked about where he wanted his legacy to end up and pretty much said TNA would be number one in the shortest time ever . He can\u00e2t possibly believe this stuff , can he ? 4 - DR . STEVIE & RAVEN vs. ABYSS & MICK FOLEY Foley didn\u00e2t come out when his music hit , but Abyss managed to blind - side the heels at ringside . Raven turned things around and gave Abyss a Russian leg-sweep into the guardrail . The bell finally rang when all three men were in the ring . The heels cornered Abyss , one choking him with a boot and the other kicking away at him . They seem to be alternating between taking tags and having it as a Triple - Threat rules . Abyss finally stacked the heels up in the corner and splashed them . Raven got clotheslined and Stevie was up for Shock Treatment , and it hit . But Raven attacked before Abyss could make the pin . Raven took something out of his pocket - a lighter . But Abyss kicked him in the face . Slick Johnson saw the lighter on the ground and apparently , that was grounds enough to give Abyss the DQ win . WINNER : Abyss , via DQ , at 2:27 . Raven and Stevie continued the onslaught after the match , with Raven giving him the Evenflow DDT outside the ring . Daffney gave Stevie a cable and Raven choked Abyss with it . That continued as they cut to break . [ Commercial Break ] -\u00e2 Trash Talk\u00e2 with ODB aired . I guess this is a continuation of \u00e2 ODB\u00e2s Angle . \u00e2 Her first guest- Homicide . His gift for her was a bottle of Tequila . He sat in the backseat of a car , but it was on the set and not in a car . And ODB sat in a recliner . ODB asked him about Suicide , or , \u00e2that skull guy\u00e2 as she put it . Homicide said he wanted a title shot from ODB tonight and wants to make things a step up from TV - PG . Then he spit out some Tequila and they started dancing . Just awful . - Lauren interviewed Tomko backstage . He said it seems better than ever in TNA . He said he can\u00e2t wait to show the fans what he should\u00e2ve shown them during his first run . He seemed intent on giving Dixie Carter what she wanted - intensity . Then he walked off as the Beautiful People walked up . Velvet Sky took the mic from Lauren and talked to the camera , saying there was a blond whore backstage bothering wrestlers with stupid questions . She interviewed the rest of the Beautiful People about it , and they were pretending to cry over what they saw . What could the payoff to this \u00e2feud\u00e2 between Lauren and the Beautiful People be ? - AJ Styles sucked up to Hulk Hogan , answering the question , \u00e2what does Hulk Hogan\u00e2s arrival in TNA mean to you ? \u00e2 [ Commercial Break ] 5 - ALISSA FLASH vs. SARITA Shoulder tackle took down Sarita . She came back to bump Flash and there seemed to be a brief pause with neither woman knowing what to do , but Sarita went to the top and splashed Flash . She tried a springboard , but Flash kicked her in the stomach on the way down . Flash kicked away at Sarita and stayed on offense for some time . She kept zipping down a little , then up her leather jacket - thing she was wearing . Belly - to - belly overhead suplex by Sarita and both ladies were down . Springboard dropkick from Sarita for two . Back suplex by Flash though , after several reversals . Sarita rolled through a move by Flash , but only got two . Back heel kick seemed to knock Flash out and gave Sarita the win . WINNER : Sarita , at 3:47 . It\u00e2s always a treat to see Sarita out there . No complaints from me . Traci Brooks attacked Flash on the ramp after the match . - After a few seconds of that , they went backstage where Foley was looking for Dr. Stevie and Raven . They managed to blindside him and attack him . Raven sarcastically asked if Foley was having fun , as they choked him like they did Abyss . Speaking of which , some follow - up on Abyss would be nice . After all , the segment wasn\u00e2t over ( he was still being choked ) when they went to break - how did things end ? Did Abyss leave the Impact Zone on his own power or what ? But there\u00e2s no time for that , we\u00e2ve got to cram as much as we can onto the show ! [ Commercial Break ] 6 - TEAM 3D & RHINO vs. D\u00e2ANGELO DINERO & MATT MORGAN & HERNANDEZ - STREET FIGHT RULES MATCH This is a return match from Turning Point . The faces sprinted to the ring and went right after 3 D and Rhino . Hernandez hit the ropes , but Brother Ray clotheslined him down . I\u00e2m still not sure if I fully buy this 3D heel turn . Hernandez did the Undertaker dive over the top and onto Devon and Rhino . A chair and some garbage cans were brought in the ring . Dinero used the tops of the cans to ring Brother Ray\u00e2s bell , and he subsequently did a Flair flop . I don\u00e2t know if there was a cut or what , but I thought Ray flopped on a garbage can in the ring ( which he moved while he was \u00e2out on his feet\u00e2 ) , but then in the next shot , he was outside the ring fighting with Dinero . Morgan did the back elbows in the corner on Devon , with the garbage can over Devon\u00e2s head . Pin only got two . There\u00e2s a Singapore Cane in the ring too , by the way . Now it was Rhino and Hernandez\u00e2s turn for a segment in the ring . Hernandez visibly called a spot on camera and Rhino went to the middle rope for a suplex , but Hernandez pushed him down then splashed onto him . That only got two . Ray slammed Hernandez in the ring and Devon went for the Whassup drop , but Pope nailed him with some Kendo Stick shots . Chokeslam by Morgan on Bubba . Morgan slammed Devon off the top . Pope put the stick right onto Devon\u00e2s\u00e2\u00a6 . well\u00e2\u00a6stick , then landed an elbow off the top onto the prone Dudley boy . The faces got the tables , but Morgan missed a legdrop on Bubba through one at ringside . Brother Ray walked into the ring at the perfect time and he and Devon did 3D on Dinero . But Hernandez propelled himself over the top onto 3D . Morgan speared Rhino but could only get two . Someone came out of the crowd , shirtless with jeans and a major Mohawk . It was Jesse Neal who , SWERVE , hit Morgan in the head with a chair and put Rhino on top for the win . WINNERS : Team 3 D and Rhino , at 7:25 . The new look certainly fits Neal better . [ Commercial Break - Styles and Angle argued in the locker room . But they have a tag match later ! Can they co-exist ? ] - JB was backstage with Team 3D , Rhino and Jesse Neal . Neal did a comically bad \u00e2angry face\u00e2 to the camera . Rhino yelled and said Neal finally gets it . Brother Ray said this is what happens when you train with Team 3D . Ray said Neal was the future of TNA , not Morgan , Dinero , or Hernandez . Neal said if you want to be hardcore or extreme , you\u00e2ve got to train with the most hardcore and extreme . Devon said they\u00e2d eliminate the likes of Morgan , Hernandez and Dinero from TNA . Lots of yelling , but not a bad promo from Neal . - Tenay and Taz talked on camera and Tenay apologized for them not having an interview set up with Sting as was scheduled , as apparently he no-showed . - Lauren was backstage with Desmond Wolfe and Daniels , as they face Styles and Angle next . Lauren asked if they were on the same page . Wolfe said usually he\u00e2s a loaner , but he has developed a lot of respect for Daniels . He said they\u00e2ve both got something to prove . Wolfe called Angle\u00e2s submission move that he used to beat him with at Turning Point , \u00e2illegal . \u00e2 Daniels seemed to think TNA was against him , and he said he\u00e2d prove tonight that he deserves a one - on - one title shot . [ Commercial Break ] 7 - DANIELS & DESMOND WOLFE vs. KURT ANGLE & A.J. STYLES I love how this has a 20 - minute time limit , even with 11 minutes to go in the show . Daniels and Angle did some mat wrestling to a stalemate in the first minute . Heel kick by Daniels for only one . Angle invited Wolfe into the ring , but Wolfe wasn\u00e2t so quick to agree to that . Instead Styles tagged in , and Daniels quickly tagged out to Wolfe . Dropkick , then a back - breaker on Wolfe . Angle finally got a piece of Wolfe and had the upper-hand \u00e2til Daniels kicked him in the head behind the ref\u00e2s back . The heels worked the left arm of Angle , the one he was having trouble with at Turning Point . Tenay said they might have the four best wrestlers in the world today in this one match . Taz noted Wolfe\u00e2s European style , but didn\u00e2t really explain what that was . Angle made a comeback against Daniels and both men made tags . Styles cleaned house on Wolfe , and gave him a beautiful back - breaker out of a Samoan drop . Pele kick found the mark . Daniels tripped Styles up as he went to the top rope . Wolfe gave Styles the Tower of London for only two . Angle chased Wolfe from the ringside area and Daniels landed the BME for the win . WINNERS : Daniels & Wolfe , at 6:43 . Good main - event tag . Daniels celebrated what the announcers called a statement win as the show went off the air . Greg Parks has been covering Smackdown for PWTorch.com since January of 2007 .

The order was issued by a three - judge bench comprising Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry , Justice Jawwad S. Khwaja and Justice Khilji Arif Hussain hearing a case about alleged corruption in the affairs of National Insurance Company Limited . S.M. Zafar , the counsel for Makhdoom Amin Fahim , said his client was innocent and asked the court to avoid making observations which might amount to directing the investigation . \u201c When you do it who will not follow it , \u201d he asked . \u201c Then let us close the case , \u201d the chief justice remarked . But Mr Zafar said he just wanted justice to be done . Justice Khwaja observed that gone were the days of injustice when there were different laws for the haves and have - nots . \u201c There is no room for sentiments . We are here to uphold the Constitution with open heart . \u201d Director FIA Karachi Moazzam Jah submitted a report on progress in the investigation into purchase of 10 acres of land in Karachi by the NICL at an exorbitant price and transfer of millions of rupees from the account of Zafar Salim , a cousin of land seller Khwaja Akbar Butt , into the joint account of Amin Fahim , his son and wife . He said that a loss of Rs490 million had been caused to the NICL and the entire amount had been recovered and deposited in the NICL account . Commerce Secretary Zafar Mehmood conceded before the court that Ayaz Khan Niazi had been appointed as NICL chairman in violation of rules . No application from Mr Niazi was on record , he added . He said a summary proposing three names , including those of civil servants Naveed Arif and Anisul Hasan Mousvi , had been moved by his ministry and the prime minister approved the name of Ayaz Khan Niazi . He said that an advertisement for the contract post was necessary , but it was not done . The court noted that the appointment of Mr Niazi was not in accordance with the law which required a candidate to have direct experience of insurance business . \u201c Rules are subservient to the statute . This is a public company as people have paid millions of rupees to keep it alive . You are to supervise it in a manner that has been specified by the legislature , \u201d Justice Khwaja observed . The chief justice said the NICL had an annual turnover of Rs6 billion and the case against Ayaz Khan Niazi should have been sent to NAB and the FIA by now . This agitated Mr Niazi 's counsel Tariq Asad who complained that \u201c I am being condemned unheard . \u201d He said an impression was being created that his client was not eligible for the job . \u201c We are just asking questions , \u201d the chief justice said . But the counsel said that the proceedings were one -sided . He said Mr Niazi had worked with leading banks at handsome salaries and stressed that management of funds had direct relevance with the insurance business . Justice Khilji said : \u201c He may be a very good banker but under section 12 of the insurance law , he is required to have direct relevance with the insurance business . \u201d The hearing was adjourned for one week ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}
