The guitarist , singer and songwriter had enjoyed a burst of activity in 1969 , a period during which he played live and in the studio with Blind Faith , John Lennon ( documented on Live Peace in Toronto 1969 ) and Delaney & Bonnie and Friends ( showcased on the duo 's On Tour with Eric Clapton ) . Near the end of that year , he took part in a one - off celebrity concert in London with Lennon , George Harrison and others to benefit UNICEF . In 1970 Clapton played on sessions including Harrison 's All Things Must Pass triple - album . He continued his creative and productive streak with the landmark Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs , crediting the release to Derek and the Dominos . That same year , the group , not including guest guitarist Duane Allman , toured and recorded a live album , In Concert ; that double LP would eventually be released in 1973 . Clapton did surface briefly in the summer of 1971 in New York City to appear as a backing musician for George Harrison 's all - star benefit Concert for Bangladesh . But other than that admittedly high - profile project , Clapton was absent from the music scene for the better part of 1971 and 1972 . Related : Clapton recently made a surprise appearance at a charity gig The primary reason for Clapton 's disappearance was his descent into the throes of heroin addiction . His condition was partly the result of ( or exacerbated by ) his unrequited love for Pattie Boyd Harrison , wife of his friend George . Another friend , Who guitarist Pete Townshend , knew of Clapton 's plight and urged him to return to active musical duty . To that end , Townshend organized a pair of concerts \u2014 a matinee and an evening performance \u2014 to be held January 13 , 1973 , at London 's Rainbow Theatre . Townshend assembled an ad-hoc band to back Clapton for the two shows . Ronnie Wood of Faces ( and later of the Rolling Stones ) provided support on guitar and vocals , as did Townshend , with Clapton playing lead guitar and ( mostly ) singing lead . Two recent associates of Clapton also came to his aid for the Rainbow Concert : singer and multi-instrumentalist Steve Winwood and bassist Ric Grech had only recently concluded their time as band mates with Clapton in Blind Faith . And Winwood brought along some of his Traffic band mates , drummer - vocalist Jim Capaldi and Ghanian percussionist Rebop Kwaku Baah ( the latter is credited on the original Rainbow Concert LP simply as \u201c Rebop \u201d ) . Adding even more percussive foundation to the performances was Jimmy Karstein , late of Delaney & Bonnie and Friends as well as J.J. Cale 's 1972 album , Really . Listen to \u201c Little Wing \u201d from the Rainbow Concert Faces bassist Ronnie Lane did n't participate directly in the concert , but he did provide the facilities of his pioneering 16 - track Mobile Studio , built by American audio engineer ( and eventual producer ) Ron Nevison , to capture the performances on tape . Glyn Johns ' previous production work with the Beatles ( Let it Be sessions ) , the Who ( Who 's Next ) and Faces ( A Nod is As Good as a Wink \u2026 to a Blind Horse ) made him the ideal person to produce the Rainbow Concert . A brief 35 - minute audio document of the concerts was released by RSO Records in September 1973 , but more than two decades later , a remastered release provided a much fuller representation of the two Rainbow concerts , doubling the album 's length and featuring 14 songs that , drawing from both shows , re-created the experience of hearing a full set of music . The set list as showcased on the 1995 remastered edition of Eric Clapton 's Rainbow Concert features songs from Derek & the Dominos , Blind Faith , Cream and Clapton 's self - titled 1970 solo album . The set also includes an early Traffic song , \u201c Pearly Queen \u201d with a lead vocal by Winwood . Some of the tracks on the 1995 reissue are longer than their original vinyl-release counterparts ; others are shorter . But unlike many one - off all - star concerts that would follow in the decades to come , Eric Clapton 's Rainbow Concert is largely free of the aimless jamming that so often characterizes such events . After an announcer introduces the assembled musicians as \u201c Eric Clapton and the Palpitations , \u201d Clapton fires off the memorable riff that opens \u201c Layla . \u201d Backed by the guitar firepower of Townshend and Wood , Clapton is able to deliver an impassioned , tight live reading that the one - guitarist Derek and the Dominos could n't ever pull off live ( it 's worth noting that neither live Dominos album features a performance of \u201c Layla \u201d ) . For the song 's elegiac , piano- led second half ( credited to drummer Jim Gordon but based on a melody from Rita Coolidge ) , Winwood takes center stage . Ronnie Wood does a workmanlike job of re-creating Duane Allman 's memorable slide guitar solo , but his instrument is quieter in the mix than Clapton 's guitar . Listen to \u201c Layla \u201d from the concert Clapton had collaborated with George Harrison to write \u201c Badge , \u201d a song that originally appeared on Cream 's swan song , Goodbye . Though Harrison , who played on the studio version under the alias \u201c L'Angelo Misterioso , \u201d is n't present here , the live version hews quite close to its supremely melodic studio counterpart . Listen to \u201c Badge \u201d from the 1973 Rainbow show Eric Clapton 's solo career would be characterized largely by mellow , laid - back songs ; he 'd earn commercial , if not always critical , success with songs like \u201c Wonderful Tonight \u201d and \u201c Tears in Heaven . \u201d But on his solo debut , he served up a midtempo rocker called \u201c Blues Power . \u201d Opening with the provocative line \u201c Betcha did n't think I knew how to rock 'n ' roll , \u201d the guitarist nicknamed Slowhand proved that , indeed , he did . At the Rainbow Concert he tackles the song with a bit more boogie feel , and an impressive guitar solo , but otherwise follows the studio version , adding an extended vamp at its end . Co-written with keyboardist Bobby Whitlock , Clapton 's \u201c Roll it Over \u201d first appeared on the Layla album . A deceptively straightforward blues , the song features a snaky lead guitar line and a shifting chord sequence that 's musically a cut above the rote blues purveyed by many acts of the era . Clapton and his ad - hoc backing band settle comfortably into the groove of \u201c Roll it Over . \u201d Jimi Hendrix died in September 1970 , and Clapton reportedly took the death of his fellow guitarist rather hard . A cover of \u201c Little Wing \u201d in tribute to Hendrix was a highlight of Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs , and a live reading is featured in the Rainbow Concert . Clapton and the band take the tune at a measured pace , highlighting the pathos and majesty of the composition . The crosstalk of two lead guitars adds a pleasingly \u201c busy \u201d feel to the performance . The relatively undistinguished \u201c Bottle of Red Wine \u201d is a standard if uptempo I - IV - V blues tune that appeared originally on the 1970 Eric Clapton album and as the B-side to the \u201c Blues Power \u201d single . The band has fun with the tune live onstage , and the arrangement does provide plenty of space for Clapton to solo over the top of the familiar chord changes . The Rainbow Concert version of Clapton 's \u201c After Midnight \u201d ( written by J.J. Cale ) is remarkably different from its studio counterpart . The recording on Eric Clapton features a kinetic rhythm section full of shakers and other percussion that move the song along . The live version is technically taken at the same tempo , but the simpler arrangement loses the quality that helped make the song special . It 's worth noting that on his 1979 live album Just One Night , Clapton played the song with a lively arrangement much more faithful to his original studio version . The impassioned slow burn of \u201c Bell Bottom Blues \u201d is among the strongest tracks on Derek and the Dominos ' sole studio album ; it 's a major highlight of Rainbow Concert as well , with the upper-register harmony vocals that characterize its chorus . After a bit of seemingly ad-libbed commentary from Pete Townshend ( a few words about how well rehearsals for the show had gone , and an aside about drummer Jim Capaldi having contracted an STD ) , he leads the band into \u201c Presence of the Lord , \u201d a meditative Blind Faith number with a lovely Steve Winwood lead vocal . Listen to \u201c Why Does Love Got to be So Sad \u201d from the Rainbow Concert Clapton takes the spotlight once again for the soulful \u201c Tell the Truth , \u201d another Clapton co-write that benefits from the involvement of Bobby Whitlock . Interesting chord changes enliven the shuffling , melodic song , and the live band serves up a faithful reading . Though he 's ultimately deep in the mix , well below even Pete Townshend 's rhythm guitar , Ronnie Wood plays some very tasty slide guitar . The live version does go on a bit long , but placed in the middle of the performance , it 's not an unwelcome occurrence . Clapton introduces \u201c Pearly Queen , \u201d the second track on Eric Clapton 's Rainbow Concert to feature a Steve Winwood lead vocal . The performance is a bit loose-limbed , but holds fairly close to the original version as featured on Traffic 's second , self - titled album from 1968 . The first of two blues classic in the Rainbow Concert set list is Big Bill Broonzy 's \u201c Key to the Highway . \u201d Clapton had first recorded it in the form of an impromptu jam during the sessions for Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs . Even in edited form , that studio version ran in excess of nine minutes . For the Rainbow Concert , or at least in the version featured on the 1995 remastered release , Clapton and band wrap up the tune in less than six minutes . Again a bit low in the mix , Ronnie Wood turns in a superb slide guitar solo , one that effectively upstages Clapton 's more conventional solo that follows it . One of Clapton 's first and most effective forays outside the blues idiom was his 1970 single \u201c Let it Rain . \u201d With a signature riff that spotlights the musical dialogue between lead guitar and bass , the song is one of the brightest spots in Clapton 's solo catalog . The Rainbow Concert band seems quite comfortable with the song 's simple , straightforward structure , and makes the most of it . Winwood , in particular , digs into the song and plays some deeply textured organ runs throughout . The song - proper is over in less than three minutes ; from that point forward \u201c Let it Rain \u201d transforms into a free - for - all jam in the style of Derek and the Dominos ( or the \u201c Apple Jam \u201d disc included in George Harrison 's All Things Must Pass ) . A full two minutes is taken over by a drum \u201c solo \u201d ( featuring the band 's three percussionists ) ; following that , the jam section returns for a final minute . Clapton takes an opportunity to thank Townshend for putting the event together ( \u201c because I would n't have done it if it had n't have been for him , \u201d he admits ) , and then the assembled musicians close the set with \u201c Crossroads , \u201d the Robert Johnson blues classic that had been a centerpiece of Clapton 's live sets with Cream . With the ad - hoc band , Clapton takes the tune at a much less frenetic pace , and there 's a sense that the band , or at least Clapton , is getting tired by this point . But all involved do their best to deliver a spirited reading of the song , which stumbles to an end in under four minutes . It 's widely believed that Pete Townshend 's successful efforts to bring Eric Clapton out of his self - imposed musical exile would mark a turning point of sorts . Soon after the pair of shows at the London venue , the guitarist put his heroin addiction behind him , and by April of the following year he was back in Miami , Florida 's Criteria Studios , where he had cut Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs , recording his acclaimed 1974 album 461 Ocean Boulevard . Clapton has many concerts scheduled . Tickets are available here and here ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

But the ways people communicate are always moving on . Just one year ago , I decided to launch an app for smartphones and tablets called Doorstep EU .

This kind of very rapid dissemination of information is something that 's only become possible in recent years through mobile devices , but it was something I was keen to try as a way of reducing the perceived distance between Brussels and Yorkshire ( not to mention providing an antidote to some of the more skewed claims in our national press ! ) . I had no idea , when I launched Doorstep EU on iOS and Android , quite how successful it would be . Although it 's entirely focused on British EU issues , the app now has thousands of active users across many different countries , from Australia to Zimbabwe . And with many more people taking an interest in European affairs , the user base has steadily grown month by month , now including a large number of journalists , politicians and academics , as well as the people I 'm keenest of all to reach \u2014 the residents of my own constituency . Twelve months on , I 've continued to develop the app with new content ( I recently added detailed statistics about the impact of the EU on each UK region ) and new features ( you can now share content directly via email and social media ) .

It extends for approximately 50 km , from a point west of Mar\u012bv\u0101n ( 46\u00b0 0 ' east longitude , 35\u00b0 30 ' north latitude ) south - eastwards to the confluence of the two branches of the river S\u012brv\u0101n ( 46\u00b0 20 ' east longitude , 35\u00b0 10 ' north latitude ) . The K\u016bh-e Owr\u0101m\u0101n range has several peaks of over 2,000 m , the highest being K\u016bh-e Ta\u1e35t , 2,985 m. It is continued south of the S\u012brv\u0101n by the K\u016bh-e \u0160\u0101h\u014d , which rises to 3,223 m . Parallel to these , east of the S\u012brv\u0101n , is the K\u016bh-e S\u0101l\u0101n , 2,597 m . The chief products of the area are various orchard fruits , walnuts , gall - apples ( for tanning ) , and terebinth mastic . The territory has four divisions : Owr\u0101m\u0101n-e Loh\u014dn , southwest of the main range ; main village , Nows\u016bd : Owr\u0101m\u0101n-e Ta\u1e35t , north of K\u016bh-e Ta\u1e35t ; main village , \u0160ahr ( \u0160\u0101r ) -e Owr\u0101m\u0101n : Dezl\u012b , further north : Raz\u0101b ( Raz\u0101w ) , around the K\u016bh-e S\u0101l\u0101n . The population of the valley numbers perhaps 10,000 persons . They are distinguished from the Kurds , who surround them on all sides , to some extent by their traditional dress , but especially by their language ( see Avromani ) , which is an archaic dialect of the G\u014dr\u0101ni group . They pay allegiance to branches of the Bagz\u0101da family , which traces its descent back through at least three centuries in the first instance , and ultimately to legendary kings of Iran . The chieftains often use the title S\u0101n , i.e. , sultan , dating from Safavid times . The main divisions are the \u1e24ama- Sa\u02bf\u012bd - S\u0101n\u012b family in Loh\u014dn , the \u1e24asan - S\u0101n\u012b in Ta\u1e35t , the Bahr\u0101m - Bag\u012b in Dezl\u012b , and the Mo\u1e63\u1e6daf\u0101 - S\u0101n\u012b in Raz\u0101b . At the beginning of this century all branches of the Bagz\u0101da family succeeded in extending their sway over a number of non- Avromani villages adjoining their homelands . The Loh\u014dni branch , in particular , acquired B\u012b\u0101ra and Taw\u0113la , both the seats of Naq\u00e6band\u012b shaikhs , among other villages in Iraq , and P\u0101va , to the south of the S\u012brv\u0101n . ( The men of P\u0101va , like their neighbors of \u1e24aj\u012bj in Loh\u014dn proper , are known as wandering peddlers , who formerly traveled the length and breadth of the Caliphate . ) With the increase of the power of central government in Iran and Iraq after the First World War , however , their depredations ceased and several chieftains were dispossessed and exiled .

The Keystone State is home to many more Amish besides those in Lancaster, however.\nWith 53 total settlements, Pennsylvania leads the nation in number of Amish communities (see Amish Studies site).\nAmish communities in Pennsylvania\n- Lancaster County-the Lancaster community is the oldest and best-known of all Amish settlements\n- Big Valley-this central PA settlement is home to three distinct Amish groups\n- New Wilmington-this large settlement in western Pennsylvania is a quite conservative Amish affiliation\n- Indiana County\/Smicksburg-3,000 Amish live in Indiana County in west-central PA\n- Somerset County-the Somerset County group is small, but is the second-oldest Amish community in North America and unlike most others\n- Other Pennsylvania settlements-Pennsylvania is scattered with Amish settlements, some comprising a half-dozen or more congregations, some just a handful of households\nLancaster County\nLancaster County is home to the oldest (founded circa 1760) and largest Amish community in the world, with 179 church districts as of 2010 (see Amish Studies website for more on Amish populations; Lancaster vs. Holmes County, OH size ranking also explained here). The Lancaster community includes over a dozen congregations located in neighboring Chester County.\nLancaster County Amish drive grey-topped buggies. Nearly all Lancaster church districts are considered to be of the same affiliation. There is some variety of practice and technology among districts, with more conservative Amish generally living in the southern half of the settlement. Lancaster Amish are considered to be among the more progressive when it comes to technology allowed.\nFarming remains important to Lancaster Amish, though population pressures have limited agricultural opportunities. Some Amish have begun small-scale produce operations, suited to labor-intensive agriculture on small plots of land.\nBusiness has been another way Amish have made a living in the face of high land costs. Small business is very important in the Lancaster Amish economy, with an estimated 2000 Amish-owned companies. These include manufacturers, builders, quilt makers, furniture shops, market stands, and a variety of others (read more on PA Amish furniture).\nLancaster Amish have also formed numerous daughter settlements in states such as Wisconsin, Indiana, New York, and Maryland.\nLancaster County is by far the most heavily-visited Plain community, and has developed a thriving tourist industry. Some Amish participate in tourism, either operating businesses selling product to tourists, or in some cases catering directly to tour groups. Tourism is controversial among Amish, with some seeing it as detrimental to the community, and others considering its positive side in the economic support it provides.\nLancaster County became known to the world after the tragic schoolhouse shootings of October 2006, in which five Amish girls died, and five were wounded, at the hands of a disturbed gunman. The Amish response of forgiveness became a headline story around the world which inspired many.\nOld Order Mennonites in Lancaster County\nLancaster County is also home to a large population of Old Order Mennonites, who populate the northern end of the county, near Ephrata and its environs. Old Order Mennonites are distinguished from the Amish here by their black-topped buggies and bicycles (local Amish primarily use push-scooters instead).\nAlso know as \u201cTeam\u201d Mennonites, this group has maintained a stronger connection to farming than the Amish, and rely more heavily on tractors as well to manage and work the land. Old Order Mennonites and Amish cooperate on education and operate joint schools, attended by children of both groups.\nOld Order Mennonites also distinguish themselves in the style of plain dress worn, and by the allowance of public electricity and telephones in the home.\nBig Valley\nPennsylvania is home to the well-known settlement at Kishacoquillas Valley, also known as \u201cBig Valley\u201d (Mifflin County). Big Valley is exactly that\u2014a 30 mile-long by 5-mile wide valley, which is home to three distinct groups of Amish\u2014the so-called Byler, Renno, and Nebraska groups. These groups are most easily distinguished by the coloration of their carriages\u2014yellow (Byler), black (Renno), and white (Nebraska).\nThe Nebraska Amish are among the most conservative in Pennsylvania and in Amish society as a whole. There are various theories as to the reason for the unusual color patterns of the carriages here. Big Valley is distinct in its diverse Amish population.\nBig Valley is the third oldest of all Amish settlements (founded around 1791) and is home to around 30 districts spread across its three main affiliations.\nBelleville in the center of the community is home to a well-known auction building, where Amish and their neighbors trade livestock, share meals, and chew the fat. Big Valley remains largely off the tourist trail due to its fairly remote location.\nNew Wilmington\nThe small college town of New Wilmington, north of Pittsburgh, is at the center of a quite conservative settlement of Amish. The New Wilmington group is the 4th largest in the state, with approximately 3,000 Amish in 18 congregations as of 2010 (see Amish Studies).\nThe New Wilmington Amish have origins in the Big Valley settlement, specifically with Big Valley\u2019s Byler group.\nThe New Wilmington Amish directory describes members of the community often traveling between New Wilmington and Big Valley on foot\u2014a distance of 250 miles lasting 5 or 6 days. \u201cByler\u201d is by far the most common last name in the New Wilmington community.\nTravelers in the New Wilmington settlement will likely notice two distinct colors\u2014the unusual burnt-orange hue of the buggies, and the preponderance of blue\u2014nearly all Amish doors are painted a sky blue, and local Amish stick to wearing shades of blue and purple.\nNew Wilmington is the only surviving Pennsylvania community founded in the 19th century (1847).\nIndiana County\/Smicksburg\nThe area of Smicksburg in Indiana County is home to another settlement of Amish of a similar size to New Wilmington (18 church districts), though it was founded over a century later, in 1962. Amish here drive Midwestern-style black buggies.\nSomerset County\nAnother distinct Pennsylvania Amish settlement can be found at Somerset County in the south-central part of the state on the Maryland border.\nSomerset is unusual among Pennsylvania settlements and in fact among nearly all Amish communities in that it is home to one of the only groups of Amish who hold Sunday service at meetinghouses, rather than practicing home worship.\nFounded around 1772, Somerset County is the 2nd-oldest Amish community in North America. Despite its nearly 240-year history, this settlement remains tiny compared to Lancaster County, with a mere 5 church districts.\nOther PA Amish settlements\nPennsylvania is also home to a large number of smaller, off-the-beaten path Amish settlements.\nThe Lebanon County (1941, 6 church districts) and Dauphin County (1978, 8 districts) communities are two Lancaster daughter settlements located in neighboring counties to Lancaster.\nThe sizeable Juniata County Amish settlement (1950, 7 districts) has roots in the Big Valley community, a spin-off Renno Amish community. The Sinking Valley setllement also consists of settlers from the Big Valley settlement, making up a single church district in an isolated valley a dozen or so miles west of the home community.\nCrawford County is remarkable for being the county containing the greatest number of individual Amish communities, with a total of 7 as of 2008 (see Amish Settlements Across America: 2008). Significant settlements in this county include the community at Atlantic (1924, 6 districts), Spartansburg (1966, 9 districts), and Conneautville (1969, 3 districts).\nIn Clearfield County, a stone\u2019s throw from the town of Punxsutawney (of Groundhog Day fame), one finds a good-sized Amish settlement of 8 congregations. The only PA Swartzentruber Amish community is found in Cambria County.\nDozens more Amish communities, many just one or two congregations in size, can be found throughout Pennsylvania.\nPennsylvania: An Amish heartland\nPennsylvania is home to a wide variety of Amish settlements, ranging from the very conservative to the more progressive. Lancaster is clearly the state\u2019s most prominent community and will continue to be so, despite having faced skyrocketing land prices and urban encroachment in the latter half of the 20th century.\nThough there has been significant out-migration in recent years, Amish continue to form new settlements in Pennsylvania, with a number being founded in the past decade.\nPennsylvania and Ohio have long been considered the foremost states when it comes to the Amish. The two states have nearly the same amount of settlements and total Amish population. Additionally, the Lancaster settlement is nearly identical in size to the large Holmes County, Ohio Amish settlement.\nOhio is home to a larger number of individual congregations, however. Pennsylvania congregations tend to be larger on average. Despite their similarities in size, in the popular imagination, Pennsylvania remains the state most readily associated with the Amish, and Lancaster the best-known and most heavily-visited community.\nFor further information, see:\nThe Riddle of Amish Culture, Donald B.

Finkenzeller , W. Ziehr and E. B\u00fchrer ( Stuttgart , 1989 ) ascribed to Tartakower a remark quoted as Eine Drohung ist st\u00e4rker als eine Ausf\u00fchrung . In the English - language edition ( London , 1990 ) that came out lumberingly as A threat is more effective than the actual implementation , whereas the usual rendering is The threat is stronger than the execution . Moreover , Nimzowitsch , rather than Tartakower , is customarily named as the coiner of the phrase , with everything tied into the famous smoking threat anecdote . On page 191 of the July 1953 CHESS M. Lipton pointed out two contradictory versions of the story of Nimzowitsch complaining that his opponent was threatening to smoke . On pages 31 - 32 of Chess for Fun & Chess for Blood ( Philadelphia , 1942 ) Edward Lasker asserted that the incident , involving a cigar , had occurred in an offhand game between Nimzowitsch and Emanuel Lasker in Berlin ( although there was still , according to Edward Laskers account , an umpire to whom Nimzowitsch could protest ) . On page 128 of The Worlds Great Chess Games ( New York , 1951 ) Reuben Fine stated that the scene had been New York , 1927 , and that Nimzowitsch complained to the tournament director , Mar\u00f3czy , when Vidmar absent - mindedly took out his cigarette case . New York , 1927 was also given as the venue by Irving Chernev ( This is the way I heard it back in 1927 , when it occurred ) on pages 15 - 16 of The Bright Side of Chess ( Philadelphia , 1948 ) . Nimzowitsch , we are told , complained to the tournament committee that Vidmar looked as if he wanted to smoke a cigar , but Chernev mentioned no remark about the threat being stronger than the execution . It is not possible to say when the story first appeared in print . After Alfred Brinckmann had related it in Deutsche Schachbl\u00e4tter in 1932 , the BCM ( page 307 of the July 1932 issue ) accorded it 16 lines , stating that Nimzowitschs objection to tobacco smoke was well known but that A. Brinckmann tells what is to us a new story in this connection . According to the Brinckmann version ( New York , 1927 , Vidmar , cigars ) , the Nimzowitsch punchline to the unnamed tournament director was No , but he is threatening to smoke , and as an old player you must know that the threat is stronger than the execution . On page 158 of the May 1954 BCM D.J. Morgan stated regarding the Nimzowitsch story : The original version in the Evening Standard was contributed by its then chess editor , H. Meek , and we have our friend Mr Meeks authority for saying that he received the story by word of mouth from Mar\u00f3czy , the controller of the tournament in question ( New York , 1927 ) . None of this explains why Tartakowers name has been seen or , indeed , when the epigram first evolved . All we can say for now is that in 1932 Tartakower contributed a two - part article on the subject of threats to Les Cahiers de lEchiquier Fran\u00e7ais and that in the second part ( issue 28 , page 373 ) he wrote : Pour conclure , invitons le lecteur \u00e0 r\u00e9fl\u00e9chir sur les consid\u00e9rations suivantes : 1 . Puisque la menace est plus forte que lex\u00e9cution , il nest pas paradoxal de pr\u00e9tendre quil est plus fort de ne pas user de la menace . Quon appelle cette strat\u00e9gie louvoiement , jeu positionnel ou strat\u00e9gie dattente , cest une fa\u00e7on de jouer qui est tr\u00e8s pratiqu\u00e9e dans les grands tournois et qui donne souvent de bons r\u00e9sultats , car il peut en r\u00e9sulter chez ladversaire une moindre vigilance . Elle peut , en outre , lui faire perdre patience et le pousser \u00e0 s\u00e9lancer dans une attaque pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e . How far back is it possible to trace the threat \/ execution remark , in the writings of Tartakower , Nimzowitsch or anybody else ? And did Mar\u00f3czy ever pen an account of any such Nimzowitsch incident at New York , 1927 ? ( 3197 ) Peter Anderberg ( Harmstorf , Germany ) notes that the above-mentioned feature by Alfred Brinckmann was published on page 50 of the 15 February 1932 issue of Deutsche Schachbl\u00e4tter : From Per Skjoldager ( Fredericia , Denmark ) : The only example I can find of Nimzowitsch using the phrase about the threat being stronger than the execution is on page 137 of the 9\/1933 issue of the Danish magazine Skakbladet , where he annotated his game against I.E.W. Gemz\u00f8e ( who was Black ) from that years Politiken training tournament in Copenhagen : Black played 20 Qe7 , and Nimzowitsch wrote : This retreat by the strongly - posted queen is an excellent move . The pawn at e5 is now heading for its sad fate . It should be noted that Black has continually operated with the threat of Qxa2 without executing it ( the modern doctrine , which says that the threat is stronger than the execution ) . For reference , his original Danish text reads : Dette tilbagetog af den st\u00e6rkt posterede dronning er et fortrinligt tr\u00e6k : Be5 g\u00e5r nu sin triste sk\u00e6bne i m\u00f8de . L\u00e6g m\u00e6rke til , at sort bestandig har opereret med truslen Dxa2 uden dog at udf\u00f8re den ( den moderne l\u00e6rdom , der siger , at truslen er st\u00e6rkere end udf\u00f8relsen ) . ( 3200 ) Despite Nimzowitschs well - known dislike of tobacco , page 87 of Visiting Mrs Nabokov by Martin Amis ( London , 1993 ) affirmed that Nimzowitsch used to smoke an especially noxious cigar . We have now found a much older and more extensive version of the alleged Nimzowitsch observation discussed in C.N.s 3197 and 3200 . From pages xiv-xv of Chess Openings by James Mason ( London , 1897 ) : A threat or menace of exchange , or of occupation of some important point , is often far more effective than its actual execution . For example , in the Ruy L\u00f3pez impending BxKt causes the defender much uneasiness . He is , to some extent , obliged to confound the possible with the probable ; while yet at the same time in serious doubt as to what may really happen . Consequently , when you are attacking a piece or pawn that will keep ; when you cannot be prevented from occupying some point of vantage , from which your adversary may be anxious to dislodge you ; when you can check now or later , with at least equal effect ; in these and all such circumstances be cautious . Do not play a good move too soon . For when you do play it , the worst of it becomes known to your antagonist , who , then free from all doubt or apprehension as to its future happening , is enabled to order his attack or defence accordingly . Therefore reserve it reasonably , thus stretching him on the rack of expectation , while you calmly proceed in development , or otherwise advance the general interests of your position . ( 3257 ) In Visiting Mrs Nabokov the article by Martin Amis , on pages 83 - 93 , was entitled Chess : Kasparov v. Karpov . It originally appeared under the title The Masters and the Mafia on pages of 17 - 18 of the Observer Review , 27 July 1986 . Relating the Nimzowitsch anti-smoking anecdote on pages 104 - 105 of their book Chess Panorama ( Radnor , 1975 ) , W. Lombardy and D. Daniels presented the punch - line as follows : I know , Nimzowitsch replied , but he threatens to smoke , and you know as well as I that in chess the threat is often stronger than the execution . ( This was one of the basic principles elaborated in Nimzowitschs brilliant work My System . ) In fact , the only instance found so far of Nimzowitsch putting forward this principle was in a 1933 magazine article ( see C.N. 3200 ) . C.N. 3257 referred to an 1897 book by James Mason which contained the concept ( A threat or menace of exchange , or of occupation of some important point , is often far more effective than its actual execution ) , but now Peter Anderberg ( Harmstorf , Germany ) points out to us that according to Georg Marco ( on page 111 of the March - April 1908 Wiener Schachzeitung ) the principle had long been followed by instinct but was first formulated by Karl Eisenbach ( 1836 - 1894 ) . This claim came at the end of the annotated game Lasker v Napier , Cambridge Springs , 1904 : Lasker folgte dabei dem l\u00e4ngst instinktiv befolgten , aber erst von Karl Eisenbach formulirten Prinzip : Die Drohung ist st\u00e4rker als die Ausf\u00fchrung . A footnote described Eisenbach as one of the deepest chess thinkers : Sekret\u00e4r der Wiener Schachgesellschaft , einer der gr\u00fcndlichsten Schachdenker , 1894 . ( 3360 ) In a list of maxims and advice on page 229 of A Breviary of Chess ( London , 1937 ) Tartakower included A threat is more powerful than its execution , and attributed it to Tarrasch . ( 4328 ) On page 49 Tartakower wrote : Bear in mind that very frequently the threat is more powerful than its execution . From Bernd Graefrath ( M\u00fclheim \/ Ruhr , Germany ) : [ C.N. 3360 above ] gives a quotation from page 111 of the March - April 1908 Wiener Schachzeitung which claimed that [ Karl Eisenbach ] had formulated the principle about the threat being stronger than the execution . I would add that the point was made again on page 151 of the May- June 1908 issue : Wichtiger als die vorgef\u00fchrten Details ist aber die Tatsache , da\u00df auch hier das Eisenbachsche Prinzip sich bew\u00e4hrt : Die Drohung ist oft st\u00e4rker als die Ausf\u00fchrung . ( 4366 ) Now we note that in CHESS , 30 September 1963 ( page 400 , but in fact page 12 ) Salo Flohr brought in a different name : I remember an incident involving Grandmaster Nimzowitsch . He couldnt bear tobacco smoke , and in one tournament he set as a condition that his opponent should not smoke . His rivals agreed . When Bogoljubow put a full box of cigars on the table before sitting down to play against him , he hurried to the chief umpire in great excitement . The umpire checked up and said , But Bogoljubow isnt smoking . I know he isnt , Nimzowitsch fumed , but he threatens to do so , and the threat in chess is more powerful than the execution . Flohr was not necessarily claiming to have been an eye-witness , but it may be recalled that the incident is usually placed at New York , 1927 , where neither Bogoljubow nor Lasker participated . ( 4496 ) From Joost van Winsen ( Silvolde , the Netherlands ) : The story was also told by Gerard Oskam on page 41 of Schaakmat , February 1951 . He wrote that Aron Nimzowitsch set the condition that there should be no smoking by his opponents , who included H. Weenink ( 1892 - 1931 ) . Oskam stated that the incident occurred before the game between Nimzowitsch and Tartakower , and he reproduced dialogue allegedly exchanged between the two masters . There are , though , problems with Oskams story . He said that it happened in Li\u00e8ge in 1923 , but no such tournament took place . Nimzowitsch , Tartakower and Weenink did participate in Li\u00e8ge , 1930 , but Oskam stated that it took Nimzowitsch 35 minutes to make his first move , 1 e4 ; at Li\u00e8ge , 1930 Nimzowitsch was Black against Tartakower , in a Caro - Kann Defence which was drawn after 20 moves . In fact , Oskams article indicated that Tartakower was not a smoker , which is corroborated by Kmoch and Reinfelds list quoted on page 235 of A Chess Omnibus . Vidmar discussed his own cigar- smoking habits ( including a story involving Tartakower at London , 1922 ) on page 114 of his memoirs Goldene Schachzeiten ( Berlin , 1961 ) . The smoking anecdote was also related by G. Koltanowski on pages 441-442 of CHESS , 14 August 1936 . He called it an old but very good story which had occurred years ago in a double round tournament and he spread out the action , involving Nimzowitsch and Vidmar ( plus pipe ) , over the two rounds in which they faced each other . Nimzowitsch was stated to have complained to Mar\u00f3czy , the tournament director . That suggests New York , 1927 , except that it was not a double round tournament . As so often , Koltanowski purported to present the actual words spoken by the protagonists , but when he related the story again on page 13 of his 1968 book TV Chess , the actual words were altogether different . ( 4505 ) On page 97 of Ca\u00efssas Weltreich by Max Euwe and Bob Spaak ( Berlin -Frohnau , 1956 ) the would - be smoker was Bogoljubow : ( 5601 ) Regarding the anecdote about an opponent who threatened to smoke , the longest version known to us is on pages 4 - 5 of The Pleasures of Learning Chess by Fairfield W. Hoban ( New York , 1974 ) . Forty lines of text , with abundant direct speech , are squeezed out of the alleged episode . After Laskers cigar has been slowly and carefully unwrapped and Nimzowitsch has exploded , leaping to his feet and shouting for the tournament director , Lasker says , What seems to be the trouble , Aron ? In reply , Nimzowitsch howls , You know very well what the trouble is and accuses Lasker of trying to interfere with my thinking and to ruin my game and I wont have it ! The tournament director , Mar\u00f3czy , is given hardly any dialogue , stilted or otherwise , and the apogee is a final rant by Nimzowitsch : But that isnt the point ! That isnt the point ! , shrieked the now-hysterical master . Everyone knows that Dr Lasker has written that the threat is much stronger than the execution ! ( 6677 ) Another version , from page 134 of How to Play Winning Chess by Fred Reinfeld ( New York , 1962 ) : On one occasion during an important tournament Dr Vidmar playfully placed his cigar case , full of cigars , on the playing table . Though Vidmar showed no sign of wanting to smoke , Nimzowitsch was greatly agitated . Finally , unable to control himself any longer , he ran off to the tournament director with his complaint . Trying to soothe him , the tournament director pointed out that Vidmar was not actually smoking . Yes , thats true , Nimzowitsch answered , but he might . And you know that in chess , the threat is stronger than the fulfillment . From page 369 of Aron Nimzowitsch On the Road to Chess Mastery , 1886-1924 by Per Skjoldager and J\u00f8rn Erik Nielsen ( Jefferson , 2012 ) : The anecdotes have , of course , left the impression that Nimzowitsch disliked smoking very much . But the drawing of Nimzowitsch from the tournament in Copenhagen 1923 , however , discloses Nimzowitsch to be a smoker . A letter from his younger brother Benno to Professor Becker , written in 1935 , confirms , though with a chronological vagueness , that Aron was a diligent smoker when he was young . The letter also said that he had to give it up because of health problems . Like many other ex-smokers , Nimzowitsch then developed a strong dislike for tobacco smoke . The sketch in question is shown below , courtesy of Mr Skjoldager : ( 7832 ) The space - filling potential of the smoking - threat anecdote involving Nimzowitsch and a variable supporting cast ( Lasker , Vidmar , Tartakower , Bogoljubow , Mar\u00f3czy and Lederer ) is a godsend for a certain type of ahistorical chess author . He may even decide to write a playlet : Source : page 86 of Chess Beginner to Expert by Larry Evans ( Wellesley Hills , 1967 ) . ( 8249 ) From a note on page 201 of 500 Master Games of Chess by S. Tartakower and J. du Mont ( London , 1952 ) : ... illustrating the principle that the threat is stronger than its execution ... See too Chess : Jacqueline and Gregor Piatigorsky . In all the citations of the phrase the threat is stronger than the execution , whether or not connected to the smoking anecdote , a name not seen so far is Capablanca . However , we now add a once version on page 200 of a book by W. Ritson Morry and W. Melville Mitchell , which , as mentioned in C.N. 8818 , was published in the 1960s and 1970s under a range of titles ( Chess : A Way to Learn ; Chess The Elements and the Play ; Tackle Chess This Way ; Tackle Chess ; Chess Theory and Practice ) : Dr Vidmar once promised to refrain from smoking in a game with Nimzowitsch , but in mid-session the latter approached the controller very agitatedly saying You remember Vidmar promised not to smoke ? Yes , replied the controller . But he isnt . Ah , came the reply , but he looks as if he wants to , and you know that Capablanca said a threat is stronger than its execution . ( 8818 ) Mike Salter ( Sydney , Australia ) notes that another version of the alleged Nimzowitsch anti-smoking incident was related by Carl Ahues in an article , Aus dem reichen Schatz meiner Erinnerungen , on pages 120 - 121 of the 8\/1954 issue of Schach ( 2. Aprilheft 1954 ) . From page 120 : Hier m\u00f6chte ich noch eine Anekdote einf\u00fcgen , die sich im New -Yorker Turnier ereignet haben soll . Nimzowitsch hatte Dr. Vidmar gebeten , w\u00e4hrend ihrer Partie nicht zu rauchen . Letzterer hatte sich damit einverstanden erkl\u00e4rt , aber mit der Einschr\u00e4nkung , da\u00df er nur dann eine Zigarre nehmen w\u00fcrde , wenn er in eine sehr schlechte Stellung geraten sollte . Das Treffen verlief nikotinfrei , aber Dr. Vidmar gewann ! Der ver\u00e4rgerte Nimzowitsch beschwerte sich darauf beim Turnierleiter Mar\u00f3czy \u00fcber das verdammte Rauchen . Aber Ihr Gegner hat doch gar nicht geraucht , war die erstaunte Antwort . Nicht geraucht ? Viel schlimmer als das ! Er hat mich mit Rauchen bedroht . Er hatte seine Zigarre neben das Brett gelegt , so da\u00df ich mir sagte : Machst du jetzt einen starken Zug , nimmt er eine Zigarre . Wie kann ich dabei gewinnen ! Da\u00df die Drohung st\u00e4rker ist als die Ausf\u00fchrung , sollten Sie als Schachspieler ja wohl wissen . Armer Nimzowitsch ! Wie manche seiner Meisterkollegen war er auch sehr abergl\u00e4ubisch . Wenn ich eine Partie verliere , ziehe ich mir sofort einen anderen Anzug an , sagte er einmal zu mir . \u00dcbrigens kann ich mich pers\u00f6nlich \u00fcber ihn kaum beklagen ; f\u00fcr mich war er immer ein angenehmer Kamerad . ( 9913 ) C.N. 3197 ( see above ) quoted a remark by Tartakower on page 373 of issue 28 of Les Cahiers de l Echiquier Fran\u00e7ais ( 1932 ) : 1 . Puisque la menace est plus forte que lex\u00e9cution , il nest pas paradoxal de pr\u00e9tendre quil est plus fort de ne pas user de la menace . Quon appelle cette strat\u00e9gie louvoiement , jeu positionnel ou strat\u00e9gie dattente , cest une fa\u00e7on de jouer qui est tr\u00e8s pratiqu\u00e9e dans les grands tournois et qui donne souvent de bons r\u00e9sultats , car il peut en r\u00e9sulter chez ladversaire une moindre vigilance . Elle peut , en outre , lui faire perdre patience et le pousser \u00e0 s\u00e9lancer dans une attaque pr\u00e9matur\u00e9e . Christian S\u00e1nchez ( Rosario , Argentina ) notes that the article had previously appeared on pages 132 - 134 of El Ajedrez Americano , May 1931 , with this slightly different text on page 134 : From page 65 of Il lessico degli scacchi by Yuri Garrett ( Brescia , 2012 ) : Any assumption that the footnote is the result of original research by Mr Garrett will be dispelled by scrutiny of our feature article A Nimzowitsch Story . He can , though , take responsibility for Adolf ( instead of Alfred ) Brinckmann , as well as for Jaques ( instead of Jacques ) Mieses . Mieses reminiscences about Nimzowitsch did not assert that the smoking incident occurred at Bled , 1931 , and the footnote in Il lessico degli scacchi provides another example of the perils of blind copying . The reference Hannak 1975 : 10 concerns a 1970s Italian translation of Nimzowitschs Mein System which contained , on pages 5 - 33 , an introductory essay by J. Hannak entitled Vita di un pessimista . From page 10 of that book , Il mio sistema : It is indeed indicated that Mieses article in the Schach - Taschen - Jahrbuch 1953 stated that the smoking incident occurred in a game between Nimzowitsch and Vidmar at Bled , 1931 , but Hannaks original German text , Lebenslauf eines Pessimisten in Mein System ( Berlin - Frohnau , 1958 ) , shows that the mention of Bled , 1931 was not by Mieses but was an editorial addition by Hannak himself . From page 13 : Below , courtesy of the Cleveland Public Library , is the relevant passage from Mieses article , Erinnerungen an Nimzowitsch , on page 43 of Schach - Taschen - Jahrbuch 1953 : The heading on page 37 : Nor , naturally enough , was there any mention of Bled , 1931 in an earlier , very similar , article by Mieses , Recollections of A. Nimzowitsch , on pages 241 - 244 of the August 1947 BCM . From page 244 : The question now is why Hannak specified that the smoking incident occurred during one of the Nimzowitsch v Vidmar games ( two short draws ) at Bled , 1931 .

There 's something about a beef patty topped with mayo , mustard , onions , lettuce , tomatoes , pickles and \u2014 of course \u2014 a hefty ladle of meat sauce that Winnipeggers ca n't seem to resist . But tracing the origins of the sandwich \u2014 which can be found in various iterations in many Winnipeg restaurants \u2014 is a tall order . \" A lot of guys worked for me and they stole the recipe , \" says Winnipeg 's Gus Scouras , who \u2014 along with his late brothers , George and John Scouras \u2014 is behind some of Winnipeg 's most legendary burger joints . \" Which is good . I wish them all the luck . They 're doing well . \" Scouras told CBC News that the basic recipe for the Fat Boy \u2014 if not the name \u2014 came from his restaurants . The story begins in Greece , where Scouras , now 83 , grew up . The Second World War , and the civil war that followed , ravaged the country 's economy when he was young . \" It was not a very nice place to be , \" Scouras said . In 1950 , 14 - year - old Scouras left Greece with his older brother , George . They arrived in Thunder Bay , Ont. , where their uncle owned the Coney Island Restaurant . Gus landed a job in the kitchen and learned to make the meat sauce his uncle slathered on hotdogs and spaghetti . A couple of years later , the brothers left Thunder Bay in search of better work in Winnipeg . But things were n't easy there either . From the prep line to the DEW Line In Winnipeg , Gus worked odd jobs like shining shoes and scrubbing dishes , from which he only earned about $ 14 a week . \" It was kind of rough , \" Scouras said . But he caught a break in 1955 , when he landed a gig working on King William Island ( now a part of Nunavut ) on the DEW , or Distant Early Warning , Line \u2014 a series of radar stations running from Alaska to Greenland , designed to detect a Soviet invasion from the north . It paid well , and after working for about a year , he had earned enough to move back to Winnipeg and open a small but mighty burger restaurant on Main Street and Broadway , which he called Junior 's . His brother George came on board to help him run the restaurant . \" We thought I was the junior of the two of us , so we just chose the name Junior 's , \" he said . That was where Gus and George got the idea to serve up a burger slathered with chili sauce . They called it the Lotta Burger , as in \" that 's a lotta burger . \" It was an instant success , and a year later , they opened another spot on Portage . This time , they named it after George . \" We called it the Big Boy because my brother was the big guy , the fat guy , \" he said . In keeping with the theme , the Big Boy called its version of the Lotta Burger \" the Big Boy Burger . \" The Big Boy restaurant became a regular haunt for hungry youngsters , and plastered patrons looking to grab a snack after the bar . As Gus and George became more established , their younger brother , John Scouras , moved from Greece and joined the business . Good boys make Fat Boys While Gus takes full credit for being the first Winnipegger to unite the burger patty with its sloppy soul mate , he admits that neither he nor his brothers coined the term \" Fat Boy . \" Scouras said some of his former employees at the Big Boy \u2014 many of them Greek immigrants themselves \u2014 went on to start their own burger joints , and took the patty - meat sauce combo with them , giving it new names in the process . Big Boy customers were known to casually call the restaurant 's burger \" the Fat Boy , \" and Scouras suspects Big Boy alumni who went on to other eateries wanted people to know the meaty marriage was on their menu \u2014 but did n't want to steal the Big Boy name . He said he did n't know for sure who first labelled it the Fat Boy , but offered a guess \u2014 Mike Lambos , who bought the Dairi- Wip Drive - In on Marion Street in 1959 , after working at the Big Boy . \" He 's a good boy . I wish him very well , \" Scouras said . As it turns out , his hunch was right . Lambos , 78 , still owns the Dairi-Wip and works there three days a week . \" I was the first one , \" Lambos told CBC News . \" After I left and started my own , that 's when I called it Fat Boy . \" And the name stuck . As Greek immigrants like Mrs. Mike 's owner Steve Mikos came to Winnipeg looking for something better , the Fat Boy recipe was a tried and true way to get ahead . Mikos bought Mrs. Mike's , on Tache Avenue , in 1969 , which has since joined the ranks of Winnipeg 's legendary burger joints . By the time he opened , leaving the Fat Boy off the menu was n't an option . \" It seemed like everybody in the city had it , \" Mikos said . The fat boy formula Gus Scouras also opened the famous RedTop drive - in on St. Mary 's Road with partners in 1960 , and it stayed in the family until it sold earlier this year . He 's retired now and has outlived his two brothers , but the community that grew from their restaurants remains . John Scouras 's son , Demitris Scouras , grew up helping sling Lotta Burgers at the RedTop , and saw what happened when other Greek families came to town and started serving up their own Fat Boys . \" They all copied the same formula , \" Demitris said . \" It was basically put up four walls , put up a few tables and use every inch of the restaurant . \u2026 They figured as long as they cooked good food , they would never go hungry . \" And it worked . As more burger joints popped up , they would all look out for each other , as long as they did n't open right next door . Eventually , Demitris 's father , John Scouras , started a Greek camp for kids , and would go around to restaurants like Dairi-Wip , asking them all to chip in for meals . One would supply the chicken , the other buns , and so on . At the time , Demitris just enjoyed the food , but now , looking back , he sees that his dad and uncles were building much more than a business . \" It was being part of a community , \" Demitris said . \" That 's the biggest lesson I learned growing up in an iconic restaurant in the city of Winnipeg . \""},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

The historical practice of abandoning spacecraft and upper stages at the end of mission life has resulted in 5,500 tons of space debris in low earth orbit ( See , for example , Vol. 9 , Issue 3 of NASA 's Orbital Debris Quarterly ) . The uncontrolled growth of the space debris population has to be avoided in order to enable safe operations in space for the future . Space system operators need to take measures now and in future to conserve a space debris environment with tolerable risk levels , particularly in Low Earth Orbit ( LEO ) altitude regions . As an example , the Chinese anti-satellite weapons test in 2007 destroyed the ailing Fengyun -1 C weather satellite , creating over 2,300 pieces of debris . Also , in February of 2009 a collision between Russia 's Cosmos 2251 and a commercial Iridium satellite created a cloud of hundreds of pieces of debris . If a number of other explosions and \/ or collisions occur at altitudes which are outside the denser layers of the atmosphere , and hence not subject to rapid deorbiting by air drag , the debris sources can outnumber the sinks , and an increasing spatial density could start the on - set of a cascading effect during which the particles would engage in chain reactions until they are ground to a limiting size . Altitudes with a critical particle concentration are already suspected to exist near 800 , 1000 and 1500 km . Deorbit Sail is a small satellite mission that will launch and deploy a 4 - by-4 - metre , four - quadrant sail to demonstrate deorbiting . The spacecraft will be based on a 3 unit ( 3U ) CubeSat Standard structure , with dimensions close to 10 by 10 by 34 cm . Deorbit Sail will be a satellite you could easily lift , but with power , communications , attitude control and data handling components in addition to its densely packed sail and deployment system . The sail will be able to change the satellite 's orbit through drag and solar radiation pressure . Figure 1 . Labelled diagram of Deorbitsail concept . Deorbiting simply means bringing the satellite back down to Earth . After the useful life of a satellite , it poses a risk to operational satellites in the same orbit . A deorbiting system moves the satellite out of crowded orbits , either to an area of space that is n't heavily populated or back down to Earth . Deorbitsail will return to Earth and burn up in the atmosphere . Goals The European Code of Conduct for Space Debris Mitigation requires that satellites in the LEO protected region ( < 2000 km ) are disposed of by destructive re-entry in the atmosphere within 25 years from their end of life . The DeorbitSail project aims to demonstrate that deorbiting can be achieved with a deployable sail , and to provide a proven design for the deployment system that can be applied to systems on future spacecraft . Figure 2 . Space debris at LEO ( left ) and Geosynchronous orbit ( right ) . Figure 3 . CubeSat ( left ) Solar panel ( middle ) and sail deployment ( right ) . Figure 4 . Sail deployment over time . The highest - level objectives of the DeorbitSail Project are to : - Provide research in the field of deorbiting - Provide a demonstrated and verified design for deorbiting of satellites and debris - Provide effective and efficient in - space propulsion technologies based on solar sails In addition we would like to achieve the following secondary objectives : - Demonstrate avoidance manoeuvre by controlling sail attitude - Perform sail ground imaging exercise . This will also involve a sail attitude manoeuvre . The research objectives of this project will be fulfilled by the production of a satellite that can perform the following tasks : - Fully deploy a 4 m by 4 m sail from a 3 U sized package - Deorbit from an altitude of 600 km in less than 180 days - Provide photographic , orbit trajectory and attitude data confirmation functions The deorbiting shall be accomplished with a design that provides the following functions : - Three - axis control of the s\/c sufficient to maintain pointing relative to velocity vector - Deployable solar panels to sufficiently power all subsystems - Imaging capability to photograph the deployed sail - Space to ground communications capability Advantages Deorbit Sail will use drag to lower its orbit and demonstrate a system that can be used for solar sailing at altitudes where drag forces are very low . The drag produced by the thin atmosphere in low earth orbit has a lot in common with the force of solar radiation pressure . Both can be captured best by maximizing the area of the spacecraft . Both produce very low levels of force . Most importantly , both are inexhaustible sources of force , requiring no propellant from the spacecraft . Drag force can be used even when no spacecraft systems are working , and solar radiation pressure demands only an operating attitude control system . Because performance for both types of decelleration is governed by spacecraft frontal area , one design can do a good job at catching atmospheric drag at low altitudes ( below about 600 km ) and exploiting solar radiation pressure at high altitudes .

Local businessman Mike Hall is investing to bring a new Southern Professional Hockey League team to the Ford Center . The announcement comes less than three weeks after the ECHL 's Ice Men franchise said it was leaving Evansville for Owensboro , Kentucky . Hall , a self - proclaimed hockey \" superfan \" and IceMen season ticket holder , said he wanted to be part of the solution to keeping hockey in Evansville . The 45 - year- old with a background in mechanical engineering said he 's owned several businesses . After seeing the IceMen in 2012 , he fell in love with the game . Hall decided he wanted to keep hockey alive in Evansville , after the IceMen 's announced departure . He spoke to officials from different professional leagues , and said he considered the SPHL the best fit . Hall 's new SPHL team does not yet have a name , mascot or logo . He plans to hold a public contest to determine the name of the new team . He expects to reveal details of that plan in the coming months . CANVASS EXTRA : Meet SPHL owner Mike Hall The IceMen 's departure came after months of contract negotiations broke down between IceMen owner Ron Geary and the city officials over leasing the Ford Center . The five - year lease offered to the new team has the same terms as the one rejected in January by the IceMen , officials said . Details were not available , but Winnecke said the terms benefit both the city and the team . Evansville Redevelopment Commission President Randy Alsman expects the commission to discuss and vote on the lease at either of its next two meetings . While discussions have taken place over the last few weeks , the lease was officially offered Monday . The SPHL has nine active franchises for the current season . Unlike the ECHL , teams in the SPHL do not have affiliations with National Hockey League teams . The 12-year - old league is based near Charlotte . SPHL teams are in Peoria , Illinois ; Fayetteville , North Carolina ; Pensacola , Florida ; Southaven , Mississippi , a suburb of Memphis ; Huntsville , Alabama ; Knoxville , Tennessee ; Lafayette , Louisiana ; Columbus , Georgia ; and Macon , Georgia . A 10th franchise , in Roanoke , Virginia , is to join the league next season . Evansville will bump that up to 11 teams . The IceMen play 36 games a year at the Ford Center . SPHL teams have 28 home games a season . Its season begins Oct. 21 . In an email to the Courier & Press Monday morning , Ice Men Chief Operating Officer Jim Riggs noted areas with multiple hockey teams . \" Recent history of ( minor league ) hockey shows when there are two pro teams in same market all it does is split existing fan base , \" Riggs wrote in the email . \" Our goal , obviously , is to retain as much of our Evansville base as we can while growing the base in Kentucky . \" The IceMen 's new home rink at the SportsCenter in Owensboro is 40 driving miles away from the Ford Center . Winnecke said he 's confident the area can support two professional hockey teams . \" We think that professional hockey is very sustainable here . We think that Mike has come up with a business plan that will work here . And it 's certainly going to be incumbent upon he and the team he builds in the coming weeks and months to promote the team and get the fans in the stands , \" he said . League President Jim Combs said no other SPHL team is as close to another professional team as the new Evansville team will be to the IceMen . Combs said he is n't worried about hockey fans being split between the two cities because they 're unique markets . \" Our main priority is this community , this Ford Center and that owner there , \" he said pointing to Hall . \" We want to make this the best for Evansville and we want to make it successful here . \" Announcements about who will coach and play on the team wo n't likely come until after the end of all the professional hockey league seasons .

After New Line Cinema 's unfettered success with The Lord of the Rings trilogy a few years ago , the Hollywood powerhouse must have been feeling bullish on the prospect of turning other multivolume fantasy literature into lavishly produced , big -budget movies . Next on the docket is the first entry in Philip Pullman 's celebrated His Dark Materials series , titled The Golden Compass , which is due to hit theaters in December . Famed developer Shiny Entertainment is hard at work on an accompanying video game to be released by Sega . At the publisher 's press event this morning , we saw some brief work - in- progress footage of both the game and the movie . We also got a few details on the production of the game , which is due to hit shelves a little before the movie itself . The book , movie , and game all follow the journey of Lyra , a young girl in an alternate , fantastical universe who must travel to the desolate north to rescue her best friend . She 'll be joined by Pan --a shape - shifting and friendly daemon that we saw become a cat , a butterfly , a mouse , and several other animals during the movie footage -- and Iorek , a massive bearlike creature that appears to serve as the brawn of the outfit . You 'll get to play as all three characters throughout the game 's 11 action levels , and two of those levels will be set in environments that do n't appear in the movie at all . ( The designers plumbed the original novel for the inspiration of these exclusive levels . ) You 'll encounter characters in the game based on those of the film , including the icily lovely villainess played by Nicole Kidman and a matronly witch played by Eva Green . Nascent James Bond Daniel Craig will also appear in the movie and game , though Sega and New Line are giving such sparse details about the project right now that we do n't know a lot about any of these characters just yet . Nor did we get any real information about what the gameplay will be like , though we did see a few brief clips of what looked like standard platforming in some nice - looking fantasy environments . In fact , New Line is holding back information on The Golden Compass in preparation for an unveiling of several minutes of the finished film at the Cannes Film Festival in just a couple of weeks . Afterward , there ought to be quite a bit more in terms of media and information released on both the movie and the game . We do know that the artists and designers at Shiny are working closely with the people making the movie , using facial scans of the principal actors and photographs of the costumes , props , and set designs to create a game as aesthetically cohesive as the movie on which it 's based . Because we barely glimpsed the actual game itself , it 's hard to say exactly how The Golden Compass is shaping up , but New Line appears to be giving the film due attention : It said the studio will ready a massive marketing push for the latter part of the year . We should get to see the game by that time and will bring you firmer impressions of its gameplay as soon as we can . GameSpot may get a commission from retail offers .

The new facility at RAF Waddington acts as a central hub which connects existing RAF simulators around the country , allowing multiple simulators to work together in daily repeatable exercises . The work has been undertaken by Henry Brothers Midlands at a cost of about \u00a3 8 - million . The project team faced a number of challenges including working around RAF training periods and carefully timing noisy work to reduce disruption . RAF personnel were training only three metres away from parts of the work so the team built a temporary wall and adapted their construction techniques and hours of work to make sure they did not interrupt training . A great relationship with the Air Battlespace Training Centre was vital to make sure they could continue training to maximum effect . Like everyone , the team also had to deal with the impact of COVID - 19 . Work halted in March for four weeks while steps were taken to ensure the project could continue safely . It also understandably caused a delay in delivery of materials needed for the project but a proactive attitude and close working relationships between DIO , Henry Brothers Midlands , the RAF and Boeing Defence UK helped to reduce the impact . DIO 's Project Manager , Dan Wilmott , said : I 'm really pleased with how everyone pulled together not just to deal with the many challenges presented by construction in the age of COVID - 19 , but also throughout the rest of the project . The end result is a tremendous facility which will be of great benefit to the team at RAF Waddington and RAF aircrew community across the country . Air Commodore David Bradshaw , Senior Responsible Owner for the Gladiator programme , said : The completion of this infrastructure project is the first stage of a larger programme of the Royal Air Force 's future synthetic training capability . This new capability , known as Gladiator , will provide a step -change in the ability of our front-line Forces to train together in operationally realistic situations to meet an ever-increasing adversary threat . The successful completion of this project is a shining example of collaboration between the Royal Air Force as an end user , DIO as the delivery agent and Henry Brothers Midlands as the construction partner to deliver a facility to meet the future requirements of collective synthetic training . Wing Commodore David Williams , Officer Commanding the Air Battlespace Training Centre , said : My team and I have been working closely with the programme and DIO teams throughout the design and construction process to ensure our requirements were fully understood and met . I have been really impressed by the collaborative approach everyone involved has taken to work as one team to deliver this new facility .

At the beginning of his address , the Holy Father recalled , in the first place , the sacred nature of the internal forum , the intimate sphere of the relationship between God and the faithful , which is not always understood and correctly protected , even within the ecclesial community itself : \u201c And I would like to add \u2014 beyond the text \u2014 a word on the term \u201c internal forum \u201d . This is not a trivial expression : it is stated seriously . The internal forum is an internal forum , and it cannot go \u201c outside \u201d . And I say this because I have noticed that some groups in the Church , representatives , superiors \u2014 let us put it this way \u2014 blend the two things and take from the internal forum to make decisions in the external one , and vice versa . Please , this is a sin ! It is a sin against the dignity of the person who trusts the priest , and who expresses his or own situation to ask for forgiveness , and then this is used to organize matters for a group or a movement , perhaps \u2014 I do n't know , I am improvising \u2014 perhaps even a new congregation , I do n't know . But the internal forum is an internal forum . And it is a sacred thing . I wanted to say this because I am concerned about this . \u201d The Pope then went on to reiterate the absolute inviolability of the sacramental seal , an indispensable guarantee of the sacrament of reconciliation : \u201c Reconciliation itself is a benefit that the wisdom of the Church has always safeguarded with all her moral and legal might , with the sacramental seal . Although it is not always understood by the modern mentality , it is indispensable for the sanctity of the sacrament and for the freedom of conscience of the penitent , who must be certain , at any time , that the sacramental conversation will remain within the secrecy of the confessional , between one 's conscience that opens to grace , and God , with the necessary mediation of the priest . The sacramental seal is indispensable and no human power has jurisdiction over it , nor can lay any claim to it . \u201d The Apostolic Penitentiary , which for eight centuries has been the Apostolic Tribunal responsible for matters concerning the internal forum , knows well the inestimable value of the sacramental secret , of the reserve , and of the inviolability of the conscience . In writing the Note that is now presented , he wished to place himself at the service of Peter , the Church and all men of good will , reaffirming their importance and promoting a better understanding of such concepts that currently seem to be widely misunderstood or even , in some cases , opposed . The document begins with the observation that in today 's highly mediated society , technological development and the implementation of the media do not correspond , in general , to a similar commitment to the search for truth , but rather to the morbid desire of circulating news , true or false , amplified or diminished according to interests . Today everything is displayed , everything must be known . \u201c By invoking , in fact , the judgment of public opinion as the final court , information of all kinds , belonging also to the most private and reserved spheres , which inevitably ( ... ) induce , or at least favour reckless judgments , unlawfully and irreparably damage the good reputation of others \u201d . This generalized attitude is also reflected on the Church , whose legal order is expected , at times , to conform to that of the States in which it lives in the name of a supposed correctness and transparency . In this context , the Apostolic Penitentiary considered it urgent to recall , in the first place , the absolute inviolability of the sacramental seal , which is based on divine law and does not admit any exception . The priest confessor , acting in persona Christi capitis , knows the sins of the penitent \u201c not as a man , but as God \u201d , according to a well - known expression of Saint Thomas Aquinas . For this reason , he is called to defend the secret of the content of the Confession not only through \u201c loyalty \u201d to the penitent , but , moreover , out of respect for the sanctity of the sacrament . In this sense , it is essential to insist on the incomparability of the seal of confession to the professional secrecy proper to certain professional groups ( doctors , pharmacists , lawyers , etc. ) in order to prevent secular laws from applying to the seal , which is inviolable , the exceptions legitimately applied to professional secrecy . The secrecy of confession is not an obligation imposed from the outside , but rather an intrinsic requirement of the sacrament and , as such , can not be dissolved even by the penitent . The penitent does not speak to the confessor as a man , but to God , so to stake a claim to what rightfully belongs to God would be a sacrilege . It concerns the defence of the sacrament itself , instituted by Christ to be a safe harbour of salvation for sinners . If trust in the seal were to be defrauded , the faithful would be discouraged to access the sacrament of Reconciliation , which would obviously lead to serious damage to souls . On the other hand , it is precisely this concern for the salus animarum that moves the Church to establish the most severe penalties for those who violate the seal ( see canon 1388 CIC 728 , \u00a7 1 , No. 1 and can. 1456 CCEO ) . Secondly , the Note considers the juridical - moral scope of those acts of the internal forum that take place outside the sacrament of Penance . The classic example is that of spiritual direction . Also in these cases , canon law guarantees a special reserve for spiritual conversation , which involves the most intimate and personal sphere of the faithful in order to listen and discern the will of God . Thus , for example , on the occasion of admission to the sacred Order , it is forbidden to ask the opinion not only of the confessor but also of the spiritual director of the candidate , to avoid any possible abuse of power . Finally , the last point of the Note deals with the other \u201c types \u201d of secrecy that fall outside the scope of the internal forum . In this sense , the principle of the natural right to keep secrecy is reaffirmed , \u201c save in exceptional cases where keeping the secret is bound to cause very grave harm to the one who confided it , to the one who received it or to a third party , and where the very grave harm can be avoided only by divulging the truth \u201d ( CCC , No. 2491 ) . More generally , when communicating or concealing the truth , the Note proposes as a general criterion that of \u201c conforming one 's life to the precept of brotherly love , with an eye toward good and security , respect for private life and the common good \u201d . It should be noted that the text of the Note cannot and does not seek to be any way a justification or a form of tolerance towards the execrable cases of abuse perpetrated by members of the clergy . No compromise is acceptable when it comes to promoting the protection of minors and vulnerable people , and of preventing and combating all forms of abuse , in the spirit of what Pope Francis has constantly reiterated and has recently regulated with the Motu Proprio Vox estis lux mundi ( 7 May 2019 ) . By publishing a Note on the importance of the internal forum and the inviolability of the sacramental seal , the Penitentiary has the absolute conviction that \u201c the defence of the sacramental seal and the sanctity of confession can never constitute a form of connivance with evil ; on the contrary , it represents the only true antidote against the evil that threatens man and the whole world , are the real possibility of surrendering to the love of God , of allowing himself to be transformed and transformed by this love , learning to correspond to it concretely with his own life \u201d .

The main excerpt of the interview are below ( but you 'll miss out on the voice acting ! ) So tell about yourself , I understand you 're a voice actor ? Voice actor , yeah . I 've been acting since I was a little kid , started in stage then went to film and television and VO ( Voice Over ) was the last aspect of it . [ VO 's ] been something I 've done , probably at this point the longest , so let 's hope I keep doing it for another ... 50 years ? Now how did you get from acting to VO ? For me , it was something that came along as an audition from an agent . I went in and , they did n't hate it ( my audition ) , and it went on from there . It was something I did n't even think about until it came across my table . I know acting and VO is different - how do you find it different , which do you actually prefer ? They all have their different modes of thought . With stage , you get to have a script that you work on for six weeks and you develop a character and you hone it through the live performance . Film is more of a director 's medium ; it really is n't ( in my opinion ) about the actor . You 're just bringing the director 's vision to life . That 's it . So basically you have to do all your own homework and hone it when you get in front of the director , but really they 're worrying about lighting , sound and camera angles . With VO , the script is in front of us and it 's very improv based , I feel like . It 's balancing all that and trying to give a good performance . Most people know you as a Star Trek fan and were in a fan created series with Vic Mignogna . Is there any other show , book or game you 'd like to adapt and act in ? There were talks of a couple of other things afterwards that we just have n't had time to develop . If there were another series to create in terms of fandom , I 'd love to do anything from the comic book world , a Batman or Superman ... any of those . The kid in me loves those aspects of things - Star Wars , the motion picture era of Star Trek , there are so many things to do . It sounds like you like the unknown , like science fiction and that kind of area of new things . I 've always kind of been a sci-fi guy , and to be a part of Star Trek was a lot of fun . What do you like better : directing or acting ? Oh , acting ! I like directing as well , but with directing , it works a different part of the brain . You 're more of a sculptor with directing . It 's just a different feel - you 're sitting at a different part of the car . I like them both , but acting , yeah . What is your go - to voice when you 're warming up before voice acting ? My method of warming up is just using the vocal chords and waking them up through just use . I stick with that , because a lot of the auditions and jobs that I would do fall within a certain range of my voice . So I know where the range of my voice needs to be for the day , so I can really hone in on what type of vocal prep I need to do . What would some characters say about your experience at Otakon , like Kekero from Sgt Frog and Watanuki from XXXholic ? Kero would probably say ... [ voice acting at 6:25 ] and then Watanuki would just be running around and freaking out about how many ghosts he 's seeing and how they wo n't leave him alone . If you could have any three people - dead or alive , real or fiction - to help celebrate your birthday , who would it be and why ? Man ... ( in thought ) Well ... I 'd love Dave Matthews to be there because that was the last concert I saw and I really like his musicianship . I 'd love Al Pacino to be there because he was an inspiration for me growing up - EARLY Al Pacino , not this business he 's been doing the past ten years . And then I 'd want Batman there , so that I could possibly let him know like \" Hey , listen . If you need a sidekick , I 'm available and willing to give up everything in my life to make that happen \" and just kind of state my case . That would make for an exciting birthday , I think . Is there anything you 'd like to add that I have n't asked you ? Keep an eye on my social media for things on Twitter and Instagram . I 'll always have updates about things going on there .

He had been admitted to prison on July 13, 2002, after being sentenced to life imprisonment by the special court.\nHe had moved an appeal against the sentence at the Kerala High Court and secured bail. While he was out on bail, the High Court acquitted 35 other accused and reduced Dharmarajan\u2019s sentence to five years.\nThe High Court, while rejecting the accusation of rape, convicted Dharmarajan under section 366 A (for inducing a girl aged below 18 years to have illicit intercourse with another person) and 372 (for selling minors for purpose of prostitution). Though he was supposed to surrender before the police after his sentence was revised, he did not turn up. The warrant issued in his name expired in 2010, police sources said. It is learnt that the Superintendent of Police, Kottayam, has been asked to re-issue the warrant against him.\nDharmarajan had been missing when the trial of the case started at the special court and charge sheet was filed against 39 persons out of total 42 accused then. One had died by then and another could not be identified. Dharmarajan stayed low for nearly 60 days before he was tracked to a granite quarry in Karnataka and brought to face trial.\nLawrence unsure if Nayanar was lenient\nCPI (M) leader M.M. Lawrence on Monday said he was unsure whether former Chief Minister E.K. Nayanar had been lenient to P.J. Kurien in connection with the Suryanelli case.\nTalking to media persons, the veteran trade union leader said, \u201cI don\u2019t know whether Nayanar showed generosity to Mr. Kurien in the case. As Nayanar is not alive, there is no way to crosscheck it.\u201d\nResponding to a question on why no evidence had come out against Mr. Kurien during V.S. Achuthanandan\u2019s tenure as Chief Minister, Mr. Lawrence said the question should be put to Mr. Achuthanandan, who is now the Leader of Opposition.\nDharmarajan went missing after being released on bail in October 2002."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":true}

Montreal games aim to boost gay sport movement Updated Fri. Jul. 28 2006 11:14 PM ET CTV.ca News Staff Sport has broken down barriers of race , religion and culture , and it 's that spirit organizers of the 1st World Outgames in Montreal hope will transcend people 's attitudes and strengthen the gay sport movement . \" The issue is that homophobia is still a major issue in sport -- it 's not something that 's talked about a lot , \" Canadian Olympian Mark Tewksbury , the event 's co-president , told CTV 's Canada AM on Friday . \" So the point of this event is to bridge the gap between the gay sport movement and the traditional sport movement . \" About 250,000 people are expected to flock to Montreal this weekend for the event that is the largest event of its kind in the world and historic for the gay and lesbian community . Some 16,000 participants from more than 120 countries will take part in 35 events , running until Aug. 5 . The three - day International Conference on LGBT ( lesbian , gay , bisexual , transgender ) Human Rights began Wednesday to kick off the Outgames . More than 2,000 delegates from around the world were expected to attend the 200 workshops , led by human rights leaders and scholars . Tewksbury , who is openly gay , has spent the last five years helping co-ordinate the Outgames , adding \" it 's a little surreal it 's actually happening . \" \" It 's hard to put into words what is happening right here in Montreal .... It 's more like an Olympic Games has hit this city , \" he said . Having Quebec 's sporting federations back the event has helped make the games possible , Tewksbury said . \" It 's really helped us , I think , change some attitudes with a lot of different officials and take a big step forward towards eradicating homophobia . \" Tennis champion Martina Navratilova and Canadian singer k.d. lang will among those taking part in Saturday night 's opening ceremonies . Participants in the competitions do n't have to be professional athletes , they just have to register and pay the entry fee . And the event is open to people of all sexual orientation . The culture program will bring participants together for six distinct musical , dance and social activities . Tewksbury said while there may be some protestors , he is confident the games will go smoothly . \" I was at Square Viger last night and there were more young parents with strollers and kids walking around meeting people than there were gay people , \" he said . \" So I think we 're really accepted by the broader Montreal community . \" The slogan of the Outgames is \" social change through sport . \" Video Related Stories Web Links User Tools About CTV | Careers | CTV Announcements | Advertise on TV | CTV Media | Advertise on Web Archive Sales | Tapes and Transcripts | Privacy Policy | Terms and Conditions | Contact Us | Site Map \u00a9 2006 CTV Inc.

The route to Thiruvilwamala lies along pristine Kerala rural landscape . There are wide expanse of paddy fields , houses with tiled roofs , and several tea shops . Nearing the destination , typical village paths come into view . Time seems to stand still right up to Vilwadrinatha Temple . The temple , the ' eighteen - and - a- half hills , ' and the Bharathapuzha River provide divinity to Thiruvilwamala . The cave of atonement The Bhoothamala hill stretches East - West beside the Bharathapuzha . Thiruvilawamala comprises the area around this hill along with the nearby Vilwamala and Moorikunnu . The Punarjani cave is located at boundary of the Bhoothamala and Vilwamala hills . It is believed Sage Parasurama reached here to atone for his sin of massacring Kshatriyas . Since Parasurama 's time , Punarjani is a symbol of freeing oneself of all sins . The ritual crawling through the cave takes place on the full moon Ekadesi day in the Malayalam month of Vrischikam . It coincides with Guruvayur Ekadesi . To reach the Punarjani devotees have to travel 2 km from Thiruvilwamala along Palakkad road where they find a peepul tree with a platform built around it . The ritual starts from this spot . According to manager of Vilwadrinatha temple Sunil Kartha , \u201c The Gods created Punarjani following the request of Parasurama to give salvation to the souls . \u201d \u201c The cave is a 30 - minute walk through the forest from the temple . A stream flowing down the hill is called Ganapathy Theertham . Water flows around the year in this stream and devotees wash their feet here before proceeding to Papanasini Theertham , another stream . It is believed that this stream has the presence of the waters of the Ganges . Iron hand rails have been fixed here for the benefit of devotees who take a bath and walk a short distance to the mouth of the cave , \u201d says Kartha . A person can easily enter the cave as the mouth has the height of an average man . However , the space gradually shrinks and one may have to bend to proceed . A little further the devotees taking part in the ritual will have to sit and move . A little more further one can only crawl by lying flat down in the cave . It is dark inside and each devotee has to find his way forward by touching the feet of the person in front of him . The only streak of light comes from the mouth of the cave at the other end . This light guides the devotees , who crawl towards it . The spot where the devotees start crawling is the halfway mark of the cave . From there till the end is the most difficult part . The path to the end of the cave is barely wide enough for a person to squeeze through . This section is known as the ' Boon of Punarjani ' . It takes about 45 minutes to crawl through the cave , says Kartha . At 3.30 am on the auspicious day , the priest accompanied by his aides and ritual music heads to the Punarjani . After the rituals at the mouth , the priest drops a gooseberry into the cave . The sight of the gooseberry emerging from the other end of the cave is amazing , says Kartha . People are allowed near Punarjani only on the day of the ritual . The forest department is in charge of the place and imposes severe restrictions on the remaining days . Giripradakshinam Thiruvilawamala is located in Thalappally taluk in Thrissur district . The three ponds on the three sides of the temples are known as Ramanchira , Bhagavathychira and Vaikkattychira . In olden times , devotees used to conduct circumambulation of the hills near Thiruvilawamala . This ritual is known as Giripradakshinam . The 16 - km walk around Bhoothamala , Vilwamala and Moorikunnu took a devotee through the rustic parts of Thiruvilawamala and touching the Nila River . It is believed that Adisankara had conducted Giripradakshinam . Surprises in store Legend has it that Narada was the first pilgrim to reach Thiruvilawamala . Narada said that there is a cave under the temple and it has a golden - coloured bael ( vilwam or bhel ) tree . The temple which has Maha Vishnu and Lakshmana as deities began to be seen as a place with surprises . The 30 days in the Malayalam month of Karkidakam are ideal for offering prayers . The temple is situated on top of a rock . Another surprise is the presence of a peepal ( sacred fig ) tree on the rock . This peepal is known as ' Guruvayurappan aal ' . According to legend , the famous Sree Krishna temple at Guruvayur can be reached if one travels exactly to the west from this tree . An Ayyappa temple is situated below the steps on the southern side of the main shrine . Another amazing event at the temple at Thiruvilawamala is that sunlight falls directly on the idols during the Malayalam months of Kanni and Meenam . The sight of rays of rising sun falling on the idol on the eastern side is astounding . During sunset , the idol on the western side glitters like gold . The wooden architecture of temple is striking . Wooden sculptures representing the penance of Naranarayana and a wooden chain are the attractions on the path around the shrines . There is a platform where lamps are lit near the path . There are two shrines facing east and west . The east - facing idol was installed by Parasurama , says the local myth . The Hanuman shrine at Thiruvilawamala is also among the most popular attractions . It is on the eastern side . Devotees offer garlands of betel leaves , crushed rice and garlands with the name of Rama written on them to the deity . Maidens offering prayers to Hanuman will soon enter matrimony , says legend . Such beliefs make the pilgrimage to Thiruvilawamala unique . Each and every devotee realises that all his or her experiences in life are only memories now .

In a rare Saturday hearing , Reeker sat for more than eight hours of questions from lawmakers running the impeachment inquiry into President Trump . Reeker appeared under a subpoena issued by House lawmakers , despite being ordered not to cooperate by Trump . Reeker , a career foreign service officer , was named the acting assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of European and Eurasian affairs in March , a few months before Yovanovitch became a political target and was removed from her post . Just before her ouster , however , Reeker wanted to draft a strongly - worded statement from State Department officials to strike back at the attacks she was enduring in conservative media and by allies of Trump . But that letter was scotched by David Hale , the No. 3 official in the State Department , according to the person familiar with Reeker 's testimony . Yovanovitch was seen by Trump allies as an obstacle to conducting a back - channel foreign policy with Ukraine , including the freezing of nearly $ 400 million in military aid until Ukraine agreed to investigate Trump 's political rival Joe Biden and his son . Trump has denied any wrongdoing and has called the impeachment inquiry a scam . Reeker testified he was aware of a plan to freeze the military aid to Ukraine , but he did not know why it was being held up , having no direct knowledge of the alleged quid - pro-quo scheme , the person close to Reeker said . Ukrainian policy was mostly overseen by Kurt Volker , Trump 's envoy for Ukraine , and Gordon Sondland , the U.S. ambassador to the European Union . Reeker , who had an extensive travel schedule and is the top State Department official for more than 50 countries , was not intimately involved with Ukraine at the time of the controversial call that sparked the impeachment inquiry , the individual with knowledge of Reeker 's testimony said . Reeker , who joined the State Department in 1992 , is celebrated by colleagues as an apolitical professional whose reputation is admired . \" He 's regarded as a straight - arrow professional , not a showboat , \" Dan Fried , a former diplomat who retired in the beginning of the Trump administration , told NPR in an interview . \" I've known him for a long time , and I have no idea what his politics are . He 's completely non-partisan . \" As has been the case with most of the witnesses in the impeachment inquiry , Democrats and Republicans had vastly different takeaways . Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts said Reeker 's questioning lasted much longer than anticipated because it was \" a much richer reservoir of information than we originally expected , \" but he would not elaborate . Meanwhile , Republican Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina said Reeker 's weekend deposition did nothing to advance the probe . \" Is there an impeachable offense here ? Was there some quid pro quo ? And now you have another high - ranking State Department official who did n't provide any support for that allegation , \" Meadows said . Backers of the impeachment inquiry say there are already plenty of witnesses whose testimony creates a sturdy foundation for impeachable offenses . On Tuesday , Ambassador Bill Taylor delivered explosive testimony to lawmakers in which he described a back - channel foreign policy with Ukraine , being led by Trump 's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani , where there was allegedly an attempt to tie military assistance to the country to Ukrainian authorities opening an investigation of the Bidens . Like other State Department officials who have delivered testimony as part of the impeachment inquiry , Reeker was summoned after the House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed him following an attempt by the White House to block his appearance . A whistleblower complaint , centered on a July 25 call Trump conducted with the president of Ukraine , set in motion the impeachment inquiry being pursued by three House committees . The White House released a partial transcript of the call , where Trump expressly asked the Ukrainian president to look into his Democratic rival , Joe Biden , and his son , Hunter , who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company . Trump also reminded Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that the U.S. sends military funds to the country . White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney admitted to there being an apparent quid pro quo in a whirlwind press briefing this month , telling reporters that political influence in foreign policy is not unusual . \" Get over it , \" said Mulvaney , who later tried to mop up the comments , which Democrats said were damaging . Fried , the former longtime diplomat , said he watched independent institutions and civil servants be sabotaged in communist countries over his career including Yugoslavia in the late - 1980s , but \" to see it in my own country is horrific , \" he said . \" I commend those like Reeker standing up against it . It shows their fidelity to their oath of office . \" Clarification Oct. 27 , 2019 An earlier version of the story and an earlier headline referred to Marie Yovanovitch as the former Ukrainian ambassador . She is actually the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Nobody knows exactly why , but one hypothesis is saturation : With charters having achieved market share of over 20 percent in more than three dozen cities , perhaps school supply is starting to meet parental demand , making new charters less necessary and harder to launch . If so , perhaps it 's time to look for new frontiers , especially if we want more children to enjoy the benefits of high - quality charters . One option is to start more charter schools in affluent communities , which we surely support . But we could n't help but wonder : Are we overlooking neighborhoods in America that are already home to plenty of poor kids , and contain the population density necessary to make school choice work , but lack charter school options ? Especially communities in the inner-ring suburbs of flourishing cities , which increasingly are becoming magnets for poor and working - class families priced out of gentrifying areas ? That 's the question that this report and its accompanying website address . The study , led by Miami University ( of Ohio ) Assistant Professor Andrew Saultz , analyzes the distribution of charter elementary schools across the country to provide parents , policymakers , and educators with information about which high and medium poverty communities do not have access to charter schools today . Saultz and his team defined \u201c charter school deserts \u201d as areas of three or more contiguous census tracts with moderate or high poverty and no charter elementary schools . They find that thirty - nine of forty - two charter states have at least one desert each \u2014 and the average number of deserts per state is a worrying 10.8 ( see Table 1 ) . Make no mistake : That 's a lot of deserts \u2014 and it 's particularly surprising in states that are home to lots of charter schools . We draw two key takeaways from these findings . First , the charter sector needs to move beyond city boundaries . We urge charter management organizations , other school operators , and philanthropies and organizations that boost , assist , and encourage charters , to widen their gaze and consider opening schools in places that have n't yet been on their radar but whose residents deserve more options . Second , we must address the policy and practical barriers in some states that keep charter schools from locating where they are needed . In short , if disadvantaged families are increasing in number outside the city , so should the number of philanthropists willing to support them there . We also need elected and appointed officials to adopt more supportive charter school policies , including those that allow these innovative public schools of choice to locate anywhere in the state .

( WHAS11 ) \u2013 Kentucky Kingdom announces the upcoming addition of Storm Chaser , its fifth roller coaster and second new coaster since the theme park reopened 14 months ago . Kentucky Kingdom is recognized within the amusement industry for its diverse mix of thrilling coasters , which include Thunder Run , the classic wooden coaster ranked among the top \" woodies \" in the world ; T3 , its newly revamped and reopened suspended looping coaster ; Lightning Run , a one - of - a- kind hyper coaster introduced in 2014 and rated among the top 25 steel coasters in the world by Amusement Today ; and the Roller Skater , a whimsically themed family coaster and a favorite with all ages . With the objective of offering its guests something truly unique , the park commissioned Rocky Mountain Construction to design and build its fifth and newest coaster . According to John Mulcahy , the park 's Director of Marketing and Communication , \" Rocky Mountain Construction ( RMC ) is on the leading edge of coaster design and engineering , admired by both coaster enthusiasts and industry professionals . \" Mulcahy went on to say , \" What makes Storm Chaser so special is that it will have RMC 's unique and patented iBox track , which will rest on wood , creating the \" feel \" of a wooden coaster , but will be supported by a steel superstructure . This yields a ride that 's smooth as glass , yet also very fast and intense . The iBox track also allows for the addition of exciting elements not normally associated with traditional wooden coasters . \" Some might refer to Storm Chaser as a hybrid coaster , but it 's actually an entirely new category of coaster . There are only five other parks in the world to have a coaster with the revolutionary i Box track and they are the marquee attractions at some of the largest parks in the world , including Six Flags Magic Mountain ( Valencia , California ) , Six Flags Fiesta Texas ( San Antonio , Texas ) , and Six Flags New England ( Agawam , Massachusetts ) . \" These other iBox coasters have gotten rave reviews and we 're very proud to be joining their ranks , \" remarked Mulcahy . Storm Chaser will give our guests a coaster experience like no other in the region . \" Mulcahy continued , \" Storm Chaser , standing 100 feet tall at its highest point , will be the first coaster in America to feature a barrel roll drop from a 10 - story lift hill , not to mention a near- perpendicular 78 - degree angle of descent . But that 's just the beginning . That first roll is followed by a stall dive , a tip - out corner , airtime hills , a twisted airtime drop , and even a corkscrew , features that simply ca n't be offered on traditional wooden coasters . \" Mulcahy confirmed that Storm Chaser will replace the coaster formerly known as Twisted Twins . Work on this project has already begun and Storm Chaser will be ready for its first riders when the park opens in the spring of 2016 . Ed Hart , President and CEO of Kentucky Kingdom , noted , \" Since we 're all about creating exceptional thrills at Kentucky Kingdom , Storm Chaser fits the bill . Storm Chaser would normally cost as much as $ 15 million all - in , but we 're saving money by using some of the existing superstructure from Twisted Twins . However , because of the new configuration , taller lift hill , and many other innovative features , we are essentially redesigning and building a new coaster . \" Hart went on to ask , \" When 's the last time you dropped ten stories while doing a barrel roll ? \" Fred Grubb , co-founder and \" chief innovator \" of RMC , added , \" We are thrilled to have been selected for this project and to help introduce our special brand of coaster design to Kentucky . Storm Chaser will be one of the most exciting coasters we 've ever built ! \" The American Coaster Enthusiasts ( ACE ) appears to agree . With anticipation for Storm Chaser building , ACE has selected Kentucky Kingdom to be among the four major regional theme parks to host its national convention next July . Kentucky Kingdom and Hurricane Bay is open daily through August 11th , the weekend of August 15th and 16th . Kentucky Kingdom ( only ) operates as part of the Kentucky State Fair August 20 through 30 ( see website for alternate operating hour and ticketing ) . Kentucky Kingdom and Hurricane Bay then reopen for Labor Day weekend and select weekends during the month of September ( check park schedule via kentuckykingdom.com ) ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Data Content : Since GNIS staff has been unable to maintain Domestic administrative names for quite some time ( since October 1 , 2014 ) , these records will be archived from GNIS database and will longer be available through the GNIS search application . The following feature classes will be archived : Airport , Bridge , Building , Cemetery , Church , Dam , Forest , Harbor , Hospital , Mine , Oilfield , Park , Post Office , Reserve , School , Tower , Trail , Tunnel , and Well . Natural features , populated places , canals , and reservoirs remain under the purview of the Board on Geographic Names and the Civil , Census , and Military features will also be maintained via an agreement between the Census Bureau and USGS . These remaining feature types will continue to be maintained and distributed through the GNIS search application and the bi-monthly distribution files . The administrative names data will be archived into separate files that can be downloaded from ScienceBase . We will no longer update the file once records are archived . All the information pertaining to the records will be available for download in the same format we use for the other text files . We will create a main names file , in the same format as the National file and an AllNames file ( includes official and variant names ) . Some administrative names are managed by other data themes of The National Map and are available for download from The National Map at ( https:\/\/apps.nationalmap.gov\/viewer Click Data Download ) . For all new proposals , please use the pdf proposal form . If you have questions , please send them to BGNEXEC@usgs.gov . About GNIS : The Geographic Names Information System ( GNIS ) is the Federal and national standard for geographic nomenclature . The U.S. Geological Survey 's National Geospatial Program developed the GNIS in support of the U.S. Board on Geographic Names as the official repository of domestic geographic names data , the official vehicle for geographic names use by all departments of the Federal Government , and the source for applying geographic names to Federal electronic and printed products . The GNIS contains information about physical geographic features of many types in the United States , associated areas , and Antarctica , current and historical , but not including roads and highways or cultural features . The database holds the Federally recognized name of each feature and defines the feature location by state , county , USGS topographic map , and geographic coordinates . Other attributes include names or spellings other than the official name , feature designations , feature classification , historical and descriptive information . The GNIS Feature ID , Official Feature Name , and Official Feature Location are American National Standards Institute standards as specified in ANSI INCITS 446-2008 ( Identifying Attributes for Named Physical and Cultural Geographic Features ( Except Roads and Highways ) of the United States , Its Territories , Outlying Areas , and Freely Associated Areas , and the Waters of the Same to the Limit of the Twelve - Mile Statutory Zone ) . The standard is available at the ANSI Web Store ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

It stretched for 3.4 km ( nearly 3 miles ) from modern - day Blackfriars in the west to the Tower of London in the east . After AD350 , at least 22 semi-circular towers were added to the eastern section of the city wall to provide platforms for catapult machines ( ballistae ) , the bases of several of which have survived . Enlarge the plan of London showing the passage of the wall - the red markers show sections that still survive . The walls were built of ragstone , quarried in the Maidstone district of Kent , and brought up the Thames by boat . On the external face of the structure , at ground level , a chamfered plinth 2.7 m thick was laid , made of huge blocks of brown sandstone . On the internal face , on a level with the external plinth , three courses of flat clay tiles were laid , with an offset of almost 8 cm between the top and middle tile . More than a million squared blocks of ragstone were laid in regular courses like bricks . On both faces of the wall , squared blocks of ragstone were laid in regular courses , while the core consisted of ragstone rubble , around which lime mortar was poured . Regular bonding - courses of two or three layers of tile were laid across to reinforce the wall . The original height is not certain , but it survived in recent times to a height of 4.4 m ( 14.5 feet ) , and was probably at least 6 m ( 20 feet ) high when built . Main gates set in the wall were Aldgate ( the road to Colchester ) , Bishopsgate ( Ermine Street to York ) , Newgate ( the road to Silchester ) and Ludgate ( the road to the south - west ) . There were also two lesser gates from the pre-existing fort , one later known as Cripplegate and the other , the west gate of the fort \u2013 they were not main thoroughfares . In the late - Roman period Aldersgate was added , perhaps to replace the west gate of the fort . The names of the gates are medieval and the Roman gates had successors that continued in use until they were demolished in the 17th and 18th centuries for road widening schemes . The six main medieval gates were Aldgate , Bishopsgate , Cripplegate , Aldersgate , Newgate and Ludgate . But William FitzStephen writing in the 1170s said there were seven and he specified these were along the landward wall . It is not certain what he meant by this . There were also smaller postern gates , for pedestrians , like the one by Tower Hill . However , these are not usually included in any count of the number of gates . One of these posterns was at Moorgate which was pulled down in 1415 and a new larger gate built , so that in most counts after that , Moorgate became the seventh gate .

Now , as with most videogames based on an existing license , it 's common to anticipate there will be something amiss , and with Rocketmen that worry is once again proven valid . As already mentioned , Rocketmen goes with the classical top down shooter gameplay and does throw in a few additions , but unfortunately there are far too many problems to make this one worth the download . The game 's sci-fi story , which is n't going to win any Nebula awards , begins with a possible treaty being forged between the Legion of Terra and Mars and the Alliance of Free Planets , comprised of Venus , Mercury and Earth . The former organization being the Axis of Evil , of course , turns the deal sour and kidnaps the leader of the alliance . What follows is a romp across various planets and space stations in order to settle the conflict and restore order . As with any shooter , the plot is not the main draw , so let 's get to the gameplay ! You begin by customizing your own character , and then it 's onto the action which features fairly simple controls . The left stick moves the character and holding the right stick in any direction fires weapons ranging from lasers to shotguns . The left trigger can also be used for other weapons , such as rockets or deploying turrets . Rocketmen does attempt to add some additional depth to the shooter mechanic by allowing the player to gain experience points . This enables shopping sprees after each level in to increase the effectiveness of certain weapons , buy armor and tweak other attributes such as speed and toughness . While it 's nice to see these RPG elements , keep in mind that this is an arcade game , so it 's not quite long enough to garner a lot of character development , and for the most part , we did n't see the gameplay affected by these attributes all that much . So nothing wrong so far right ? Well despite having a decent core mechanic , Rocketmen is rife with annoying gameplay problems . For starters , the camera pretty much has a will of its own . When it wants to move on to the next area , so must you . To make things even worse , it 's impossible to backtrack to other areas to collect any items you may need . It really feels like the game is holding your hand at times . With blinking arrows telling you which path you can take next , this all makes for an agonizingly linear experience . The actual shooting mechanics of the game are n't all that bad , and things can get pretty hectic when throngs of enemies are tossed at you . While there are a variety of guns to wield , each only lasts for a paltry 15 seconds , making those upgrades that can be purchased seem even more pointless . Also , in a game that is centered on shooting at stuff , the spawning weapon feels pretty weak , so make sure to increase your character 's damage skill first . Another annoying mechanic are the \u201c puzzles \u201d encountered , such as opening doors or disarming mines that merely consist of mashing the A button . The fact that I even have to press A multiple times instead of a more complex exercise just feels like lazy design and a waste of effort on the player 's thumbs . Oddly enough , the game seems to make fun of itself for these instances of mashing the A button , as the main character is bewildered that all he must do to disarm the mines is simply mash the action button . Even if these mines did happen to take you out , which they wo n't , fear not , as death is not the kind of penalty one would expect it to be in Rocketmen . Instead of having to go back to a previous checkpoint , the player simply respawns after a few seconds with some experience points taken away . As I said earlier , the experience system does not factor in much , so there is no real fear of death to be found in the game , which really robs it of any intensity . Luckily Rocketmen does allow for cooperative multiplayer for up to four players , either online or local , so gamers can progress through the campaign together . Taking on Martian minions is more fun with a few other friends , and the frame rate stays smooth no matter how much chaos is happening on screen . Overall , the graphics in Rocketmen are a bit of a mixed bag . The cut scenes consist of comic book like stills of 3D models , with very little movement that look like some sort of flash animation project a student made and did poorly on . Gameplay on the other hand is a bit better , with decent cell shaded graphics , a smooth frame rate , and nice bright explosions . The sound effects that occur during the game are all pretty regular and will sound familiar to shooter fans , but the voice acting falls completely flat . The actors have a tone in their voice that sounds like they 're just looking at the clock in the recording studio anxiously waiting to go home , and the attempts at humor are very poor , except when the game burns itself . With ten single player levels and cooperative play , Rocketmen presents a decent package , but one that was very poorly assembled . There is n't anything inherently wrong with its use of the shooter formula , but there are too many frustrating problems with its gameplay that keep it from being enjoyable . Being tugged around by the camera like a dog on a leash is no fun , and the experience system just feels poorly applied . Its slight saving grace is the presence of four player cooperative gameplay , but unless you 're planning on splitting the price with three other friends , kindly pass on Rocketmen ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

The ammunition utilized a three - shaft transfer unit that moved the rounds into the gun rotor from the feed system .

The cannon also had a linkless ammunition feed system , and any spent ammunition or unused cartridges were sent back to the storage drum . A firing burst rate of eight seconds was possible when the gun was operating at full rate , or four seconds at half rate . The barrel life of the gun was a minimum of 20,000 rounds .

The past decade has seen an explosion of interest in the application of scientific techniques to investigations of crime .

Scope and coverage : \" Forensic Science \" approaches its subject from multiple directions . One of the primary approaches is from the points of view of forensic investigators . In addition to its core essays on subspecialties and allied fields , the set has essays on specific types of investigations , such as arson , homicide , and computer crime ; both general and specific investigative techniques , such as autopsies , ballistics , chromatography , crime scene photography , fingerprint analysis , and polygraph analysis ; specialized equipment , such as bomb and nuclear detection devices ; and types of evidence , such as fire debris , fibers and filaments , glass , and blood residue and stains . A second broad approach taken by \" Forensic Science \" is its coverage of the role of forensic science in the American legal system . The set includes brief articles on some of the most important federal legislation applying to controlled substances , such as the Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914 , and the Anabolic Steroid Act of 1990 . A third broad approach taken by \" Forensic Science \" - and one that should have a wide appeal to many readers - is its extensive coverage of specific historical subjects . These range from overviews of ancient criminal cases and mysteries and ancient science in law and courtrooms to examinations of such high - profile modern cases as the O.J. Simpson murder trial , the Unabomber case , and famous Hollywood forensic cases . The set also includes essays on such subjects as the Lindberg baby kidnapping case and the exhumations of Presidents Zachary Taylor and Abraham Lincoln . Organization and format : The articles in \" Forensic Science \" contain helpful top matter that defines the topics and summarizes their relevance to forensic science and the Further Reading notes . The alphabetical arrangement makes topics easy to find . Additional finding aids include category and subject indexes and cross-references to related topics at the end of each essay . The appendixes include a biographical directory of key figures in the history of the field , a glossary , a directory of television shows in which forensic sciences figure prominently , and a time line of major events ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

In April 2013 , Kasonkomona was arrested after he appeared on a MuviTV programme where he spoke about the need to recognise the rights of vulnerable groups such as LGBT persons and sex workers in order to comprehensively address the HIV pandemic . Kasonkomona was charged under section 178 ( g ) of the Penal Code with the idle and disorderly offence of soliciting in a public place for immoral purposes . This offence dates back to the English Vagrancy Act of 1898 and had never before been used to curb the right to freedom of expression . Kasonkomona 's trial started in October 2013 . On 25 February 2014 , after the close of the prosecution 's case , Magistrate Ng'ambi ruled that the prosecution had not made out a prima facie case against the accused and acquitted Kasonkomona . The State appealed this ruling . In its submissions on appeal , the State argued that it was justifiable to limit the right to freedom of expression where persons expressed their views on the rights of LGBT persons . Justice Mulongoti confirmed the 2014 ruling that the State did not present sufficient evidence on all the elements of the offence . \u201c The judgment of the High Court is important because it confirms that it is not unlawful to lobby for law and policy reform and for the protection of the rights of marginalised groups , \u201d says Anneke Meerkotter , from SALC . \u201c It in unacceptable that the State doggedly pursued criminal prosecution of a human rights activist when they never had any evidential basis for such persecution . The outcome of this case is a victory for freedom of expression in Zambia . \u201d \u201c The judgment is a great relief . This matter took more than two years to pass through the courts , and has had a chilling effect on freedom of speech in Zambia . With the judgment , we can finally move forward and work towards firmly establishing Zambia as a country in which democratic values such as freedom of expression and the tolerance of diverse opinions can thrive , \u201d says Paul Kasonkomona .

His aim was to create an effective hangboard finger strength training program that could be safely used all year round , both off - season and during the season , while not leading to overtraining or injury . The main idea behind Steve Bechtel 's 3 - 6-9 Ladders program is to reduce the loads to the necessary minimum and progress the volume , leading to increased time under tension ( TUT ) [ 1 ] . According to Steve , the program does not require any specialized hangboards , leads to less fatigue and reduced injury risk , and is sustainable over long periods of time . While the initial strength increase may not be as spectacular as in the case of the MaxHangs protocols , the gains will be more persistent , as they will originate from the development of more efficient neurological pathways , rather than from improvements in energy - system efficiency , as it is the case with high - intensity training [ 2 ] . Steve Bechtel 's 3 - 6-9 Ladders protocol details - Choose 3 \u2013 4 different grip positions . - Try to include full crimp , half crimp , and open hand grip positions . - For each grip position determine the load that will allow you to hang for a maximum of 12 seconds . - For each chosen grip position perform the following sequence 3 \u2013 5 times : - Hang 3 seconds , rest 10 \u2013 60 seconds ; - Hang 6 seconds , rest 10 \u2013 60 seconds , or more ; - Hang 9 seconds . That 's one set . - Rest as needed between sets , typically 3 \u2013 5 minutes . - In week 4 of the training cycle add a 12 - second hang to each set .

Increasing the load too early will lead to a plateau . Bechtel 's Ladders hangboard finger strength routine results and discussion The main idea behind Steve Bechtel 's 3 - 6-9 Ladders hangboard finger strength training protocol is to effectively improve finger strength , without running the risk of injury or overtraining , while still being able to climb outdoors regularly . To achieve this goal , the program relies on progressing volume rather than load . To support his strategy , Steve refers to a research paper from 1983 , where it was shown that seven daily 1 - minute actions at 30 % of max resulted in around a 30 % gain in strength in just six weeks , indicating that low loads can successfully be applied to strength training [ 3 ] . This approach was met with some skepticism amongst experienced climbers because the study Steve refers to was done on untrained men doing isometric squats . Furthermore , it was argued that the low loads in the Ladders hangboard finger strength training program would be insufficient to trigger strength gains in the case of experienced athletes [ 4 ] . Indeed , the most critical issue with the current state of literature is that the majority of studies were carried out on untrained subjects , while it is well established that trained individuals respond differently than those who lack training experience [ 5 ] [ 6 ] . It is currently generally accepted that loads of at least 65 % 1 RM ( one-repetition maximum ) are required to trigger hypertrophy , and even higher loads are needed to maximize strength by fully recruiting higher threshold motor units [ 7 ] [ 8 ] . However , in a recent study , it was shown that recruitment of the full spectrum of motor units could be achieved with low- load training , provided that repetitions are carried out to muscular failure . The authors claim that although neural factors play an essential role in maximal strength development , and high-intensity training protocols are superior in this regard , achieving strength gains does not require regular training at high intensity . Instead , it is sufficient to introduce periods of exercise at high intensity during a low-intensity training program [ 9 ] . On the other hand , there is also evidence suggesting that recruitment is incomplete during low- load training \u2013 at least at the far right of the strength -endurance continuum [ 10 ] . In a very interesting article , the effect of low-load ( approximately 30 \u2013 50 % 1RM ) versus high - load ( approximately 70 \u2013 80 % 1RM ) resistance training ( RT ) on muscular adaptations in well - trained subjects was investigated . The results showed that while there were no significant differences in muscle thickness increase between the groups , maximal strength gains were significantly higher for the group that trained with high loads . These findings contradict the generally accepted hypertrophy training guidelines , where it is suggested that loads of at least 65 % of 1 RM are necessary to stimulate muscle growth in well - trained individuals [ 5 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] . The impact of training volume on muscular adaptations in trained men was recently investigated in [ 11 ] . The subjects were divided into low-volume , moderate - volume , and high - volume training groups , which performed one , three , and five sets per exercise per training session , respectively . Each set consisted of 8 \u2013 12 repetitions , which is considered moderate intensity , equal to roughly 50 \u2013 80 % of 1 RM [ 12 ] [ 13 ] . It turned out that changes in muscle strength and muscle endurance were similar regardless of the training volume . On the other hand , higher volumes of training lead to more significant increases in markers of muscle hypertrophy . These findings suggest that there is a certain threshold of volume that can be used in a training program , over which further increases in volume are not advantageous , and might only delay recovery from exercise . Thus a lower training volume routine can be just as effective as a higher training volume routine while being significantly more time - efficient [ 11 ] . The approximate intensity of the 3 - 6-9 Ladders hangboard finger strength training protocol 12 - second maximum hang in relation to MVC - 7 is roughly 88 \u2013 95 % , depending on the model . For comparison , the intensity of the 7 - second hangs used in Eric H\u00f6rst 's \u201c 7 - 53 \u201d protocol is around 92 \u2013 97 % of MVC - 7 and the intensity of the MaxHangs protocol can vary between 85 \u2013 103 % of MVC - 7 , which is determined by the chosen hang time and margin [ 16 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] . This shows that the loads used in the Ladders program are in fact not light at all and are definitely sufficient to trigger the neural adaptations necessary for maximum strength gains . If we consider the exercise volume , the TUT for the Steve Bechtel 's Ladders protocol can vary between 162 \u2013 360 seconds . Typically in the first week of a 4 - week training cycle , it 's only 162 seconds for three grip positions and three sets per position , but in the following weeks it goes up , to reach 360 seconds in the 4th week , because of the 12 - second hangs added to each set . As far as other protocols are concerned , the TUT for the \u201c 7 - 53 \u201d protocol is between 42 \u2013 105 seconds [ 25 ] , and the TUT for the MaxHangs protocol is between 10 \u2013 75 seconds [ 26 ] . Now it becomes clear that the exercise volume for the Ladders protocol is significantly higher than for the other strength protocols , and can be even compared with the TUT for the standard 7\/3 Hangboard Repeaters , which is between 126 \u2013 882 seconds ( typically 504 seconds ) [ 27 ] . This leads us to the conclusion that the Ladders are likely to trigger both neural and structural adaptations ( hypertrophy ) . But can Steve Bechtel 's Ladders hangboard finger strength training method be considered safer than other hangboard finger strength training protocols ? For one thing , 12 - second hangs till failure are certainly less risky than 5 - second hangs with a 1 - second margin , but that 's only an extreme version of the MaxHangs protocol [ 28 ] . On the other side of the spectrum , 15 - second MaxHangs with a 5 - second margin will be less dangerous than the Ladders . With that in mind , it does not seem that the Ladders should , in general , be any safer . One can argue that the 3 - second and 6 - second hangs can be considered a warm - up and muscle recruitment phase before the more strenuous 9 - second and 12 - second hangs , which makes it less likely to get injured , but that 's about the only advantage . In fact , Steve Maish questioned the efficiency of the Ladders program , claiming that the initial 3 - second hangs are useful only for their warm - up aspect and that it would be better to do three 7 - second hangs and increase the weight gradually [ 29 ] . Still , the 3 - 6-9 Ladders hangboard finger strength training protocol is proven effective \u2013 after all , Steve Bechtel would n't be using it if it were n't . Strength gains of 13 % after a 4 - week cycle and a total of 23 % after a full 8 - week program were reported by r\/climbharder users . It was even declared that it is possible to work your way to the loads used with the MaxHangs by following the Ladders protocol over just a few months , with much less finger pain and a lower risk of injury [ 4 ] . Experienced boulderers claim that they noticed benefits from following the protocol , without it getting in the way of their climbing outside [ 30 ] . Weekend warriors can apply it Monday through Thursday and still perform well on the rock . However , if you feel that climbing and hangboarding at the same time is too fatiguing , try doing two 4 - week cycles , and then take a month 's rest [ 1 ] . Steve Bechtel 's Ladders hangboard finger strength protocol conclusions In view of recent research results , Steve Bechtel 's 3 - 6-9 Ladders hangboard finger strength training protocol does not seem to be the most time - efficient approach to pure maximum strength training [ 11 ] . For comparison , the \u201c 7 - 53 \u201d protocol by Eric H\u00f6rst uses only slightly higher loads , but appears to provide much \u201c more bang for your buck \u201d . The same goes for the MaxHangs protocol , which can be made both easy , or very strenuous on the fingers , depending on the hang times and the chosen margins . However , since Steve Bechtel 's Ladders are characterized by a significantly higher TUT compared with other hangboard finger strength training protocols , they likely promote both neural adaptations and muscle hypertrophy , which may admittedly lead to slower , but more steady gains .

I never wore no fucking anti-gay t-shirt to an MTV press conference . It 's not true . I wore that shirt once in my life . I came off stage in Irvine Meadows in California after PANTERA had opened up for us . When we finished , I was totally hot and sweaty . The guys from L.A. GUNS were all backstage , so I said , ' Gimme a fucking shirt to put on . ' Gerri Miller from Metal Edge magazine is there asking for a picture of all of us , so I just pick up this hideous fuckin ' shirt that some fan had thrown up onto stage and put it on . We all knew it was the worst shirt of all time . It was n't some campaign that I went on . \" Metal Hammer : How did the media react ? Sebastian : \" Kurt Loder from MTV , who 's gay ( and I do n't think I 'm outing him ) got hold of the picture and put in on MTV as a news piece with all the other guys cut out : ' In the land of homophobia , if Axl Rose owns the restaurant and PUBLIC ENEMY are the diners , we have a new bus boy . ' It was like I was the anti-Christ . Then Revolver magazine in the States said , ' The most appaling moments in rock : even though Axl Rose got more press , generally Sebastian Bach behaved worse .

Rachel [ Bolan , bassist ] had a side - project with the road crew \u2014 the pyrotechs and stuff \u2014 called PRUNELLA SCALES , and he said he could n't do the KISS show because he had a gig with his side - project .

The research material is skeletal human remains from Kedaton Temple and Upas Well which consists of five individuals . These human remains are located in the residential complex of the kingdom of Majapahit ( ca. 1300 - 1500 ) , thus it can be assumed that they are associated with Indonesian classical period . The applied method of research is observation and comparison . Based on the observation of teeth , all individuals underwent dental modification . The male had the \u201c T \u201d pattern and the females had the \u201c diamond \u201d pattern . Comparison with other types of dental modifications in Indonesia shows that the pattern of dental modification among human remains from Kedaton Temple and Upas Well is different from the other modification patterns in Indonesia . If we relate the location of the grave and the location of the temple where are in the royal family residential area , hence it can be concluded that these human remains belonged to the high social status .

It makes our world dynamic and ever-changing . But should itfactor into our search for life elsewhere in the universe ? Tilman Spohn believes so . As director of the German Space Research Centre Institute of Planetary Research , and chairman of ESA ?s scientific advisory committee , hestudies worlds beyond our Earth . When looking into the relationship between habitabilityand plate tectonics , some fascinating possibilities emerged . Knowing where to look Itis thought that the best places to search for life in the universe are onplanets situated in ? habitable zones ? around other stars . These are orbitalpaths where the temperature is suitable for liquid water ; not so close to thestar that it boils away , and not so far that it freezes . Spohn believes thatthis view may be outdated . He elaborates , ? you could have habitats outsidethose , for instance in the oceans beneath ice covers on the Galileansatellites , likeEuropa . But not every icy satellite would be habitable . Take Ganymede , where the ocean is trapped between two layers of ice . You are missing a freshsupply of nutrition and energy .? Soplanets and moons that lie beyond habitable zones could host life , so long asthe habitat , such as an ocean , is not isolated . It needs access to the keyingredients of life , including hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , phosphorous andsulphur . These elements support the basic chemistry of life as we know it , and the material , Spohn argues , must be regularly replenished . Nature ?s method ofachieving this on the Earth appears to be plate tectonics . Plate tectonics - essential for life ? Itis an idea growing in popularity among planetary scientists . Says Spohn , ? platetectonics replenishes the nutrition that primitive life could live on . Imaginea top surface that is depleted of the nutrition needed for bacterial life . Itneeds to be replenished , and plate tectonics is a method of achieving this .? Spohn found that the further he delved into the issue , the moreimportant plate tectonics seemed to be for life . For example , it is believedthat life developed by moving from the ocean to the kind of strong and stablerock formations that are the result of tectonic action . Plate tectonics is alsoinvolved in the generation of a magnetic field by convection of Earth ? spartially molten core . This magnetic field protects life on Earth by deflecting the solar wind . ? Not only would an unimpeded solar wind erode our planet ? satmosphere , but it also carries highly energetic particles that could damage DNA . Anotherfactor is the recyclingof carbon , which is needed to stabilize the temperature here on Earth . Spohn explains , ? plate tectonics is known to recycle carbon that is washed outof the atmosphere and digested by bacteria in the soil into the interior of theplanet from where it can be outcast through volcanic activity . Now , if you havea planet without plate tectonics , you may have parts of this cycle , but it isbroken because you do not have the recycling link .? Ithas also been speculated that the lack of tectonic action on Venus contributedto its runaway greenhouse effect , which resulted in the immense temperatures ithas today . Allthis evidence adds up to paint a convincing picture of many lifeforms onlysurviving on worlds where plate tectonics are active . For astrobiologists , there is another interesting element to this story . Many within the planetaryscience community believe that to have plate tectonics , the near-surface rockmust be weakened . The molecule most effective at doing this is H2O -- water . So worlds with plate tectonics are likely to have water as well , which means they feature two ingredients theoretically necessary for life . Raising hopes Thispresents an exciting option : searching for plate tectonics on distant worlds asa sign of life . Spohn agrees that this is a possibility , but remainslevel - headed . ? It ?s an interesting idea , but is just speculation at themoment , ? he explains . ? As a biosignatureit would be very difficult to detect , especially with current technology ?. Theproblem is how challenging it is to spot plate tectonics from orbit even on ourown Earth . The jig-saw puzzle shape of continents along with the presence ofmountain belts provides indirect evidence . Mid-oceanic ridges are more convincing , but these are covered with water and not visible from space . To see featureson an extrasolar planet would require a probe in orbit , and this is far beyondour technological ability . Even if we were able to achieve this , the evidencewould still be indirect . Currently there is no conclusive way of remotelydetermining tectonic action on a planet . Soperhaps using these markers as an indication of life on other worlds is a steptoo far , but as our technology becomes ever more complex it could become apossibility in the future . Imagine detecting an Earth-sized planet with anatmosphere , water , organic materials , and plate tectonics . It wouldunquestionably raise hopes for finding life in the universe . - New Video - Return to Jupiter : The Europa Jupiter System Mission - Did Tectonics Get an Early Start ? - Some Planets are Better for Life"},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Use Next and Previous buttons to navigate A treatment for common sports injuries that involves shooting the patient 's own blood directly into the wound is gaining popularity among professional and recreational athletes , but doctors say that while the therapy is promising , it 's hardly a miracle cure . Sports medicine doctors expect a renewed rush of interest in the treatment after Tiger Woods said last week that he 's used platelet - rich plasma therapy , sometimes referred to as \" blood spinning , \" to help recover from injuries to his left knee and right Achilles tendon . The treatment was introduced about 20 years ago to speed up recovery from some types of surgery , usually dental or facial reconstruction procedures . Doctors started using it about 10 years ago as an alternative to surgery or drugs to treat stubborn sports injuries that were n't responding to physical therapy and other traditional treatments . \" One of the reasons it 's taken off is because patients and doctors have been dissatisfied with the other treatments , \" said Dr. Allan Mishra , a Stanford University orthopedist who was one of the first doctors in the United States to use and study the blood - spinning treatment . \" In all honesty , I was skeptical myself the first time I used it , because it seems so simple , \" Mishra said . \" But when you look back , you think , why did n't we try this before ? \" How it 's done Platelet -rich plasma ( PRP ) therapy involves taking about an ounce of the patient 's blood and spinning it in a centrifuge for about 30 minutes to separate the platelets from the rest of the cells . The concentrated platelet mixture is then injected back into the injured area . The treatment usually is n't covered by insurance and can cost about $ 500 . It 's most often used to treat overuse injuries or tears in tendons around the knee and other joints . Athletes are the target audience so far because they suffer most of these injuries , and for many of them , getting back to their sports as quickly and safely as possible is a priority . The idea behind PRP is that platelets are the body 's natural healing tool . Most people know that platelets are blood clotters - they help you stop bleeding when you 've cut yourself . But platelets also contain growth hormones that help tissues heal and regenerate . Usually when people are injured , platelets naturally activate in the wounded area and work their magic . But in some injuries , platelets may need a little boost - perhaps because there 's decreased blood flow to the wounded area , or the injury is in a trouble spot that is hurt repeatedly . Sometimes , the older a body gets , the less efficient it is at delivering platelets to an injury . The appeal of PRP therapy , doctors say , is that it 's entirely natural . Even if the treatment does n't work , the patient has n't risked anything other than some pain from the injection ( and a few hundred dollars ) . \" You 're just taking your own healing factors and concentrating them . There is n't a downside to it , \" said Dr. Jerrald Goldman , a sports physician with Webster Orthopedics who has been using PRP in the East Bay for about a year . \" The worst that can happen is it does n't work . \" Inconclusive results Studies of PRP treatment have been inconclusive , with the most rigorous scientific research showing not much difference between blood - spinning treatments and traditional therapy . A double - blind study in the Netherlands that gave some patients PRP treatment and others a saline solution found no significant difference in the pain level from their injuries after two years . But Mishra said he 's seen enough positive results in his own studies that he 's compelled to keep using the treatment and wants to see more research . He said doctors need to look at the specifics of PRP - how much is effective , over what time period , and for which types of injuries . Dr. Brian Feeley , a sports orthopedist at UCSF , said he thinks the therapy could be a good solution for certain types of injuries , especially for people who have already tried other treatments without satisfactory results . So far , though , he said he has n't seen a remarkable improvement from PRP therapy for most patients . \" We get pretty good results from what we do normally , \" Feeley said . \" People who have failed everything else may be the ones who benefit from these treatments . \" A patient 's story Devon Farrell , 21 , could be one of those types of patients . She first started experiencing knee pain from patellar tendinitis while she was a high school volleyball player in Lafayette . She continued playing at the University of Connecticut , but by her junior year the pain was starting to sideline her in games , and she sometimes hurt just sitting or climbing stairs . When she returned to Lafayette over the winter holidays a year ago , doctors told her she probably would never play volleyball again . That was when Goldman suggested she try platelet - rich plasma therapy . Farrell figured she had nothing to lose . A year later , she still has some pain , but she 's playing volleyball again - she 's planning to tour with a team in Europe after she graduates . Farrell said she worked hard with two physical therapists after getting the blood - spinning treatment , and she does n't know how much of her recovery is due to the injection or the months of therapy . \" I would call it a success for me , even though there 's still some pain . Without the physical therapy , I do n't think it would have worked as well , \" Farrell said . \" I 'm glad I did it . It was a weird thought , injecting my own blood into me . But I figured it was the only way I could keep playing . \""},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

The actor is doing something for the author 's words ; he is making the play work ; and so is the spectator as he responds to the art of the actor , the producer and the playwright . It is a unique relationship , and the play in performance must be judged by ' theatrical ' standards as well as literary ones . Styan begins with the elements of a dramatic text and the way they are built together . For every aspect - words , movement , tempo - and for larger considerations , such as verse-drama , convention , ' character ' , and audience - participation , Styan provides close analyses of excerpts from plays by Shakespeare , Ibsen , Chekhov , Wilde , Shaw , Strindberg , Pirandello , Synge , Anouilh , Sartre , Eliot and others .

as crimes to the men of old time those actions which the Scripture has not condemned but should rather seek in them types of things to come an example of this in the incest committed by Lot 1 32 That one God was the author of both testaments is confirmed by the authority of a presbyter who had been taught by the apostles 4 33 Whosoever confesses that one God is the author of both testaments and diligently reads the Scriptures in company with the presbyters of the church is a true spiritual disciple and he will rightly understand and interpret all that the prophets have declared respecting Christ and the liberty of the new testament 6 34 Proof against the Marcionites that the prophets referred in all their predictions to our Christ 18 35 A refutation of those who allege that the prophets uttered some predictions under the inspiration of the Highest others from the Demiurge Disagreements of the Valentinians among themselves with regard to these same predictions 22 36 The prophets were sent from one and the same Father from whom the Son was sent 26 37 Men are possessed of free will and endowed with the faculty of making a choice It is not true therefore that some are by nature good and others bad 36 38 Why man was not made perfect from the beginning 42 39 Man is endowed with the faculty of distinguishing good and evil so that without compulsion he has the power by his own will and choice to perform God 's commandments by doing which he avoids the evils prepared for the rebellious 45 40 One and the same God the Father inflicts punishment on the reprobate and bestows rewards on the elect 48 41 Those persons who do not believe in God but who are disobedient are angels and sons of the devil not indeed by nature but by imitation Close of this book and scope of the succeeding one 60 Book V PREFACE 54 1 Christ alone is able to teach divine things and to redeem us He the same took flesh of the Virgin Mary not merely in appearance but actually by the operation of the Holy Spirit in order to renovate us Strictures on the conceits of Valentinus and Ebion 55 2 When Christ visited us in His grace He did not come to what did not belong to Him also by shedding His true blood for us and exhibiting to us His true flesh in the Eucharist He conferred upon our flesh the capacity of salvation 58 3 The power and glory of God shine forth in the weakness of human flesh as He will render our body a participator of the resurrection and of immortality although He has formed it from the dust of the earth He will also bestow upon it the enjoyment of immortality just as He grants it this short life in common with the soul 61 4 Those persons are deceived who feign another God the Father besides the Creator of the world for he must have been feeble and useless or else malignant and full of envy if he be either unable or unwilling to extend eternal life to our bodies 64 5 The prolonged life of the ancients the translation of Elijah and of Enoch in their own bodies as well as the preservation of Jonah of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego in the midst of extreme peril are clear demonstrations that God can raise up our bodies to life eternal 65 6 God will bestow salvation upon the whole nature of man consisting of body and soul in close union since the Word took it upon Him and adorned it with the gifts of the Holy Spirit of whom our bodies are and are termed the temples 67 7 Inasmuch as Christ did rise in our flesh it follows that we shall be also raised in the same since the resurrection promised to us should not be referred to spirits naturally immortal but to bodies in themselves mortal 70 8 The gifts of the Holy Spirit which we receive prepare us for incorruption render us spiritual and separate us from carnal men These two classes are signified by the clean and unclean animals in the legal dispensation 72 9 Showing how that passage of the apostle which the hereties pervert should be understood viz Flesh and blood shall not possess the kingdom of God 75 10 By a comparison drawn from the wild olive tree whose quality but not whose nature is changed by grafting he proves more important things he points out also that man without the Spirit is not capable of bringing forth fruit or of inheriting the kingdom of God 78 11 Treats upon the actions of carnal and of spiritual persons also that the spiritual cleansing is not to be referred to the substance of our bodies but to the manner of our former life 80 12 Of the difference between life and death of the breath of life and the vivifying Spirit also how it is that the substance of flesh revives which once was dead 82 13 In the dead who were raised by Christ we possess the highest proof of the resurrection and our hearts are shown to be capable of life eternal because they can now receive the Spirit of God 87 14 Unless the flesh were to be saved the Word would not have taken upon Him flesh of the same substance as ours from this it would follow that neither should we have been reconciled by Him 91 15 Proofs of the resurrection from Isaiah and Ezekiel the same God who created us will also raise us up 94 16 Since our bodies return to the earth it follows that they have their substance from it also by the advent of the Word the image of God in us appeared in a clearer light 98 17 There is but one Lord and one God the Father and Creator of all things who has loved us in Christ given us commandments and remitted our sins whose Son and Word Christ proved Himself to be when He forgave our sins 100 18 God the Father and His Word have formed all created things which they use by their own power and wisdom not out of defect or ignorance The Son of God who received all power from the Father would otherwise never have taken flesh upon Him 108 19 A comparison is instituted between the disobedient and sinning Eve and the Virgin Mary her patroness Various and discordant heresies are mentioned 106 20 Those pastors are to be heard to whom the apostles committed the churches possessing one and the same doctrine of salvation the hereties on the other hand are to be avoided We must think soberly with regard to the mysteries of the faith 108 21 Christ is the Head of all things already mentioned It was fitting that He should be sent by the Father the Creator of all things to assume human nature and should be tempted by Satan that He might fulfil the promises and carry off a glorious and perfect victory 110 22 The true Lord and the one God is declared by the law and manifested by Christ His Son in the gospel whom alone we should adore and from Him we must look for all good things not from Satan 114 23 The devil is well practised in falsehood by which Adam having been led astray sinned on the sixth day of the creation in which day also he has been renewed by Christ 116 24 Of the constant falsehood of the devil and of the powers and governments of the world which we ought to obey inasmuch as they are appointed of God not of the devil 119 25 The fraud pride and tyrannical kingdom of Antichrist as described by Daniel and Paul 121 26 John and Daniel have predicted the dissolution and desolation of the Iloinan Empire which shall precede the end of the world and the eternal kingdom of Christ The Gnosties are refuted those tools of Satan who invent another Father different from the Creator 125 27 The future judgment by Christ Communion with and separation from the Divine Being The eternal punishment of unbelievers 128 28 The distinction to be made between the righteous and the wicked The future apostasy in the tune of Antichrist and the end of the world 130 29 All things have been created for the service of man The deceits wickedness and apostate power of Antichrist This was prefigured at the deluge as afterwards by the persecution of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego 133 30 Although certain as to the number of the name of Antichrist yet we should come to no rash conclusions as to the name itself because this number is capable of being fitted to many names Reasons for this point being reserved by the Holy Spirit Antichrist 's reign and death 135 31 The preservation of our bodies is confirmed by the resurrection and ascension of Christ the souls of the saints during the intermediate period are in a state of expectation of that time when they shall receive their perfect and consummated glory 139 32 In that flesh in which the saints have suffered so many afflictions they shall receive the fruits of their labours especially since all creation waits for this and God promises it to Abraham and his seed 33 Further proofs of the same proposition drawn from the promises made by Christ when He declared that He would drink of the fruit of the vine with His disciples in His Father 's kingdom while at the same time He promised to reward them an hundred fold and to make them partake of banquets The blessing pronounced by Jacob had pointed out this already as Papias and the elders have interpreted it 143 34 He fortifies his opinions with regard to the temporal and earthly kingdom of the saints after their resurrection by the various testimonies of Isaiah Ezekiel Jeremiah and Daniel also by the parable of the servants watching to whom the Lord promised that He would minister 147 35 He contends that these testimonies already alleged cannot be understood allegorically of celestial blessings but that they shall have their fulfilment after the coming of Antichrist and the resurrection in the terrestrial Jerusalem To the former prophecies he subjoins others drawn from Isaiah Jeremiah and the Apocalypse of John 151 36 Men shall be actually raised the world shall not be annihilated but there shall be various mansions for the saints according to the rank allotted to each individual All things shall be subject to God the Father and so shall He be all in all 155 FRAGMENTS FROM THE LOST WRITINGS OF IRENAEUS 158 INDEX OF TEXTS 189 INDEX OF PRINCIPAL SUBJECTS

Though recognized worldwide as a popular music icon , the all - to - recent time when the guitar was looked down upon as a second - class citizen in the world of \u201c serious \u201d music is finally past , and it can now be found in the scores of the most important composers . The guitar 's rightful place in chamber music , orchestral music , or as a solo instrument is now without question , whether in the classic acoustic form or the more recent electric version . While the guitar has stood in the vanguard of musical experimentation , its many new techniques and notations remain a mystery for many composers and players . In The Contemporary Guitar , musician and scholar , John Schneider explains each class of technique and illustrates them with examples . Moreover , because the guitar is easily refretted , it has also become a leading instrument in the exploration of the relatively new musical language of microtonality . In this revised and enlarged edition from the original work of three decades ago , Schneider adds a broad - ranging , entirely new chapter on the instruments , notation and repertoire with insights into the interpretation of historical works through the application of accurate contemporary tunings and temperaments . The guitar 's unique timbre \u2014its tone color \u2014 is one of the most versatile among modern instruments , both acoustic and electric . Most players who intuitively explore the subtleties of tone color will find outlined in The Contemporary Guitar the specific principles of physics that determine these subtleties which , once mastered , permit guitarists to control more completely the expressive palette of their instrument . Designated the Rational Method of Tone Production by its author , Schneider defines in great detail the timbral characteristics of acoustic and electric instruments from theoretical , physical , and musical viewpoints . Players in search of new repertoire will find an historical survey of the literature , an exhaustive list of new music , and a multitude of techniques for bringing such music to life .

For more quality articles about all things PC gaming , you can subscribe now in the UK and the US . I 'm talking to Sean Murray , one of Hello Games ' four co-founders , at our E3 PC Gaming Show in LA 's Belasco Theater . He 's just announced that No Man 's Sky is coming to PC at the same time as PS4 . We always had an inkling his game of procedurally generated space exploration was coming to our platform \u2014 the team letting us see it at gamescom last year was a big clue \u2014 but now it 's confirmed . I ca n't think of a better match . It 's a space game with clear shades of Elite , mixed with elements of the survival games that have become such a phenomenon on Steam . It 's so us . \u201c I think it 's really exciting , \u201d Murray says . \u201c Any programmer , any developer , grew up with PCs and PC games so it 's really nice to do that . If you 're doing a gigantic sandboxy space sim game , then it seems like PC should be part of that . \u201d For Hello Games , this year 's E3 was about showing people that No Man 's Sky is a real thing , and not just a pocketful of cheese dreams . Throughout last year it seemed like each trailer was a demo of the tech that enables players to explore the game 's 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 procedurally generated planets , but not the game itself . Each planet that popped up in the videos looked colourful and pleasant , and came with its own local species . We could discover and name these planets , we were told . The grandeur and extraordinary backdrop were there \u2013 what was missing was the reason to actually play . Hello Games is now being very specific about that . \u201c [ At E3 ] we tried to show space combat , combat on the ground , sandbox elements , resource gathering . You can play as a trader , a fighter , an explorer , or kind of a mixture of all three . It 's a sandbox game \u2014 there are no missions , no quests . In some ways it 's very much in the genre of game that has become very popular on PC , particularly in Early Access . \u201d I ask if he means survival games , such as DayZ . \u201c Yeah , but more than that , kind of sandboxy games , like Terraria , Stranded Deep , Salt , so many now ... The Forest . It 's generally in that genre . There 's more of a focus for us on being a huge world , so you 're not under such constant pressure , and you are able to explore , and survive for a little bit longer , but you are vulnerable and you are under threat in that world . \u201d I 'm certainly getting shades of Elite : Dangerous from Murray 's description of how the economy works in relation to progression . You wo n't be able to go everywhere and do everything at the start : it 'll take money and better ships , so do n't expect to make your ten - year journey across the universe within ten minutes of booting up . There are various ways to earn money , and discovering new places and naming exotic species is part of that . \u201c In terms of exploring , you need to have an upgraded suit to be able to survive in toxic environments and various different types of liquid . You need an upgraded ship so that you can have a bigger hyperdrive and travel to more far-flung places . For all of these things you need money \u2014 and you can earn that money as an explorer by exploring . So there 's a core loop there . It may not be a loop that you 've had in a game before , because really , most games have never been about exploration before \u2014 previously it 's always been , ' I need to find a puzzle piece . The designer has placed a puzzle piece somewhere for me , I have to find that ' , and it does ''t feel like real exploration . \u201d You are n't just exploring for the sake of having Space Feels , then , but following an Elite-like progression curve of getting better vehicles , equipment and so on . Exploring is n't the only way to make money \u2014 you can mine the destructible worlds and trade , too . \u201c You fly to a planet and you discover that planet , yes , there 's a nice buzz that you can go to a beacon and name that planet , but the real reason you do it as a player is you get money for doing it . If you discover new creatures , you get money for doing that . And if you get more money you can buy and improve your weapon , which is really called a multitool . The multitool is used for mining and combat , but it 's also used for scanning . Scanning defines how wide a range you can scan into to discover new creatures , and how many different types of discovery you can actually make . So there 's a loop there where you 're earning money to be able to explore more . But then as you go between planets , you find that they are hostile at times , so even as an explorer you ca n't just be passive or ambient . \u201d The progression systems sound as simple as any you 'd find in a survival game \u2014 dying in space costs you your spaceship , while dying on a planet just costs you your resources and recent discoveries . These systems being so familiar make No Man 's Sky seem very real to me , now , which is quite a shift from last year , where it looked very cool but seemed so ethereal . \u201c I think that 's a way we 've misled people , in that ... our trailers are often nicely flowing , and you walk around and people go , 'oh , it 's a walking simulator , '\u201d Murray says with a smile . \u201c And that 's nice , some people are really happy with that , and that is a lovely part of the game that is pretty and beautiful to go and explore . If our game was a dystopia , then I do n't think I 'd want to explore it nearly as much . As so many sci-fi games are dystopias , it 's not appealing to explore a universe full of wastelands . \u201d NO MAN'S SPY I ask Murray how Hello gets feedback from players and watching them play . I do n't want to say they spy on their playtesters , as such , but I ca n't think of another way of describing their process . \u201c Internally , even with Joe Danger and everything we 've done , we tend to get people in and really scrutinise and watch them playing . We actually have a room that 's got glass on the outside . People can sit in and play , and we can watch them from where we sit , basically . We do n't interact with them , we just watch them play . We do n't want their feedback or anything . We just watch how they get on with the game . And we do that reasonably regularly . \u201d Hello is n't into the idea of community feedback \u2014 there are secrets to this game that are worth protecting . This process makes more sense . And from their research , they 've learned that even when they have an entire universe to explore , players are really attracted to the idea of menial tasks . \u201c One thing that amazes me about how people play is trading . You can trade between space stations , between space stations and freighters , you can trade between freighters and freighters , or freighters and trading posts , and you can fly down to planets and mine some resources yourself and then sell those . So that 's trading . Trading in our game is closest thing you can have to a real - life job , right ? It is , for me , on paper , quite boring . It 's how a lot of people play . It amazes me . And you almost ca n't explain it . They 're earning money , units in our game , to be able to buy bigger ships , to be able to trade more , to be able to make more money , to be able to buy bigger ships to protect themselves , to be able to carry more expensive cargos . \u201d The way Murray describes it sounds a lot like the way I play Elite \u2014 but that 's a simulator and this is n't . If someone 's willing to just be a trader , it 's a sign that No Man 's Sky really does feel like a sandbox game . WORLD OF DIFFERENCE I think the long - term challenge Hello Games face is making sure that the hundredth world players discover has the power to amaze in the same way as the preceding ninety - nine . It 's not an unattainable feat . Finding an oddly - coloured planet in Elite feels special if you 've never seen it before \u2014 imagine how impressive it could be to have that as a repeatable experience with entire worlds , every time you push through the atmosphere and a mysterious new landscape appears . Exploration in games should always be about surprise and No Man 's Sky is being created to facilitate that . \u201c I watch players get lost , \u201d Murray tells me . \u201c And that 's not something that happens so much in games . People turn to me and go , ' I ca n't find my ship . Where did I leave it ? ' You can scan , and you can find a little marker for where your ship is , but people are often amazed . ' I got totally turned around and I did n't realise that was there ' , and about an hour or two into the game , you 'll find people playing it in a different way . They 'll actually put their ship somewhere where they can remember where it was . And they 'll keep track of there being some trees to the left , how they went down a mountain to their right . What we 're used to in games is something like Far Cry where you have pathways everywhere . They 're pre-built in and the designer has thought about you being able to see landmarks from where you are , and they 've playtested it \u2014 and [ our worlds ] do n't have that . They feel much more like real places . \u201d"},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Third party litigation funding ( TPLF ) allows hedge funds and other financiers to invest in lawsuits in exchange for a percentage of any settlement or judgment . TPLF is a global multibillion - dollar secretive industry operating in countries like Australia , throughout Europe , particularly in the UK and the Netherlands , and in the U.S. The industry has faced worldwide criticism from legal reform advocates , scholars , courts , policymakers , and legislators for its lack of transparency and potential ethical risks of turning control of litigation to an outsider . Check out ILR 's Faces of Lawsuit Abuse 's video on third party litigation funding for more information . Here 's a breakdown of how the industry operates around the world . Third Party Litigation Funding in Australia Third party litigation funding , which was invented in Australia more than two decades ago , drove an explosion of class action litigation in the country until the federal government introduced regulations to limit some of the fraud and abuses this industry generated . Currently , third party litigation funders are making an average return on investment per annum of 400 % . It has also been reported that Australia 's third party litigation funders have a 96- 98 % success rate and are making returns 10 x the global average for hedge funds . In September 2021 , Attorney General Michaelia Cash and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced a draft law regulating third party litigation funding in class actions . The proposed legislation would restrict the fees for class action lawyers and funders to a maximum of 30 % of any total payout , give courts the power to approve and adjust funding agreements , and require funders to be licensed . The proposal would also require each plaintiff to consent to participate in the class action and to the funder 's terms , creating an opt- in system for funded class actions . The bill successfully passed the Australian House of Representatives last year . To learn more about third party litigation funding in Australia , check out this episode of ILR 's podcast , Cause for Action . Third Party Litigation Funding in the EU Third party litigation funding is a multibillion - euro industry but is almost entirely unregulated in Europe . Right now , the European Parliament is considering several safeguards to ensure consumers have access to justice and pull the third party litigation funding industry out of the shadows . These measures are popular with EU consumers . For example , a 2021 survey found that 83 % of EU consumers want third party litigation funding safeguards . To learn more about the 2021 EU consumer third party litigation funding survey , check out this episode of Cause for Action . Third Party Litigation Funding in the Netherlands The Netherlands has become a magnet jurisdiction for third party litigation funding . In 2020 , the Dutch government opened the door to opt -out class actions for damages in all fields of law . This broadening of the collective action system provided more opportunities for third party litigation funders to back large groups of claimants with potentially huge payouts . As a result , at least 27 litigation funders are active on Dutch soil . This number will likely grow once the Dutch government implements the EU directive on collective actions , allowing cross -border collective actions to be brought in Dutch courts . Third Party Litigation Funding in the UK The UK third party litigation funding market is worth an estimated 2 billion pounds , with the presence of at least 60 litigation funding firms in the UK . A recent study by British law firm RPC reported a 100 % increase in the UK litigation funding market in three years . Ernst & Young also released a study in 2021 predicting increased litigation and reliance on litigation funding in the UK . With such an overabundance of capital , third party litigation funders are kick-starting their claims and highly publicizing to attract claimants . The UK is an attractive market for third party litigation funding due to the availability of opt-out collective action mechanisms and no government oversight of the litigation funding industry . Third Party Litigation Funding in the U.S. For years , ILR has called for disclosure in the third party litigation funding industry . Now policymakers and courts are paying attention to the problems with the industry . In March of 2021 , Sens . Chuck Grassley , John Cornyn , Thom Tillis , Ben Sasse , and Rep. Darrell Issa introduced the Litigation Funding Transparency Act ( LFTA ) . The bill would require plaintiffs ' lawyers to disclose third party litigation funding agreements in federal class action lawsuits and multi-district litigation . In 2021 , the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey adopted an amendment to its local rules to require the disclosure of litigation funding in any case pending in the District of New Jersey and a brief description of the funder 's financial interest in the case , among other things . The rule can be found HERE . The Federal Rules Advisory Committee for the U.S. Courts is considering amending the federal rules to require disclosure of third party litigation funding in all civil cases . Recent ILR research Selling More Lawsuits , Buying More Trouble : Third Party Litigation Funding A Decade Later examines how exactly this explosive growth has happened , how the industry is fueling abusive litigation , how the few third party litigation funding agreements that have been made public reveal serious ethical issues with the practice , and how lawmakers and policymakers can approach third party litigation funding reform . What can be done to reign in third party litigation funding industry in the U.S.? - Third party litigation funding agreements must be disclosed to all parties in litigation to minimize conflicts of interest and ensure plaintiffs retain control of their case - Fee-sharing agreements between lawyers and non-lawyers should be banned ( as several bar associations have already done ) to preserve the independent professional judgment of attorneys - Third party litigation funding should not be permitted in the class action context because funding creates a potential obstacle to class counsel and named plaintiffs satisfying their fiduciary duties to the class"},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

It is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network . X11 connections , arbitrary TCP ports and UNIX - domain sockets can also be forwarded over the secure channel . ssh connects and logs into the specified destination , which may be specified as either [ user@ ] hostname or a URI of the form ssh:\/\/[user@]hostname [ : port ] . The user must prove their identity to the remote machine using one of several methods ( see below ) . If a command is specified , it will be executed on the remote host instead of a login shell . A complete command line may be specified as command , or it may have additional arguments . If supplied , the arguments will be appended to the command , separated by spaces , before it is sent to the server to be executed . The options are as follows : - 4 sshto use IPv4 addresses only . -6 sshto use IPv6 addresses only . -A Agent forwarding should be enabled with caution . Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host ( for the agent 's UNIX - domain socket ) can access the local agent through the forwarded connection . An attacker cannot obtain key material from the agent , however they can perform operations on the keys that enable them to authenticate using the identities loaded into the agent .

Only the superuser can forward privileged ports . By default , the local port is bound in accordance with the Gateway Ports setting . However , an explicit bind_address may be used to bind the connection to a specific address . The bind_address of \u201c localhost \u201d indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only , while an empty address or '* ' indicates that the port should be available from all interfaces . - Elog_file - eescape_char ~' ) . The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a line . The escape character followed by a dot ( ' .' ) closes the connection ; followed by control -Z suspends the connection ; and followed by itself sends the escape character once . Setting the character to \u201c none \u201d disables any escapes and makes the session fully transparent . - Fconfigfile -f sshto go to background just before command execution . This is useful if sshis going to ask for passwords or passphrases , but the user wants it in the background . This implies -n. The recommended way to start X11 programs at a remote site is with something like ssh -f host xterm . If the ExitOnForward Failure configuration option is set to \u201c yes \u201d , then a client started with -f will wait for all remote port forwards to be successfully established before placing itself in the background .

Multiple jump hops may be specified separated by comma characters . This is a shortcut to specify a ProxyJumpconfiguration directive . Note that configuration directives supplied on the command - line generally apply to the destination host and not any specified jump hosts .

A common trick is to use this to run X11 programs on a remote machine .

Whenever a connection is made to this port or Unix socket , the connection is forwarded over the secure channel , and a connection is made from the local machine to either an explicit destination specified by host port hostport , or local_socket , or , if no explicit destination was specified , ssh will act as a SOCKS 4\/5 proxy and forward connections to the destinations requested by the remote SOCKS client . Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file . Privileged ports can be forwarded only when logging in as root on the remote machine . IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square brackets . By default , TCP listening sockets on the server will be bound to the loopback interface only . This may be overridden by specifying a bind_address . An empty bind_address , or the address ' Gateway Ports option is enabled ( see sshd_config ( 5 ) ) . * ' , indicates that the remote socket should listen on all interfaces . Specifying a remote bind_address will only succeed if the server 's If the port argument is ' 0 ' , the listen port will be dynamically allocated on the server and reported to the client at run time .

If the Tunnel directive is unset , it will be set to the default tunnel mode , which is \u201c point - to -point \u201d . If a different Tunnel forwarding mode it desired , then it should be specified before -w. - X X11 forwarding should be enabled with caution . Users with the ability to bypass file permissions on the remote host ( for the user 's X authorization database ) can access the local X11 display through the forwarded connection . An attacker may then be able to perform activities such as keystroke monitoring . For this reason , X11 forwarding is subjected to X11 SECURITY extension restrictions by default . Refer to the ssh - Y option and the Forward X11 Trusted directive in ssh_config ( 5 ) for more information . -x - Y -y ssh may additionally obtain configuration data from a per-user configuration file and a system - wide configuration file . The file format and configuration options are described in ssh_config ( 5 ) . The OpenSSH SSH client supports SSH protocol 2 . The methods available for authentication are : GSSAPI - based authentication , host - based authentication , public key authentication , keyboard - interactive authentication , and password authentication . Authentication methods are tried in the order specified above , though Preferred Authentications can be used to change the default order . Host - based authentication works as follows : If the machine the user logs in from is listed in \/ etc \/ hosts . equiv or \/ etc \/ shosts . equiv on the remote machine , the user is non - root and the user names are the same on both sides , or if the files ~\/. rhosts or ~\/. shosts exist in the user 's home directory on the remote machine and contain a line containing the name of the client machine and the name of the user on that machine , the user is considered for login . Additionally , the server must be able to verify the client 's host key ( see the description of \/ etc \/ ssh \/ ssh_known_hosts and ~\/.ssh\/ known_hosts , below ) for login to be permitted . This authentication method closes security holes due to IP spoofing , DNS spoofing , and routing spoofing . [ Note to the administrator : \/ etc\/hosts.equiv , ~\/. rhosts , and the rlogin \/ rsh protocol in general , are inherently insecure and should be disabled if security is desired . ] Public key authentication works as follows : The scheme is based on public-key cryptography , using cryptosystems where encryption and decryption are done using separate keys , and it is unfeasible to derive the decryption key from the encryption key . The idea is that each user creates a public \/ private key pair for authentication purposes . The server knows the public key , and only the user knows the private key . ssh implements public key authentication protocol automatically , using one of the DSA , ECDSA , Ed25519 or RSA algorithms . The HISTORY section of ssl ( 8 ) contains a brief discussion of the DSA and RSA algorithms . The file ~\/.ssh\/authorized_keys lists the public keys that are permitted for logging in . When the user logs in , the ssh program tells the server which key pair it would like to use for authentication . The client proves that it has access to the private key and the server checks that the corresponding public key is authorized to accept the account . The server may inform the client of errors that prevented public key authentication from succeeding after authentication completes using a different method . These may be viewed by increasing the LogLevel to DEBUG or higher ( e.g. by using the - v flag ) . The user creates their key pair by running ssh-keygen ( 1 ) . This stores the private key in ~\/.ssh\/id_dsa ( DSA ) , ~\/.ssh\/id_ecdsa ( ECDSA ) , ~\/.ssh\/id_ecdsa_sk ( authenticator - hosted ECDSA ) , ~\/.ssh\/id_ed25519 ( Ed25519 ) , ~\/.ssh\/id_ed25519_sk ( authenticator - hosted Ed25519 ) , or ~\/.ssh\/id_rsa ( RSA ) and stores the public key in ~\/.ssh\/id_dsa.pub ( DSA ) , ~\/.ssh\/id_ecdsa.pub ( ECDSA ) , ~\/.ssh\/id_ecdsa_sk.pub ( authenticator-hosted ECDSA ) , ~\/.ssh\/id_ed25519.pub ( Ed25519 ) , ~\/.ssh\/id_ed25519_sk.pub ( authenticator - hosted Ed25519 ) , or ~\/.ssh\/id_rsa.pub ( RSA ) in the user 's home directory . The user should then copy the public key to ~\/.ssh\/authorized_keys in their home directory on the remote machine . The authorized_keys file corresponds to the conventional ~\/. rhosts file , and has one key per line , though the lines can be very long . After this , the user can log in without giving the password . A variation on public key authentication is available in the form of certificate authentication : instead of a set of public \/ private keys , signed certificates are used . This has the advantage that a single trusted certification authority can be used in place of many public \/ private keys . See the CERTIFICATES section of ssh-keygen ( 1 ) for more information . The most convenient way to use public key or certificate authentication may be with an authentication agent . See ssh-agent ( 1 ) and ( optionally ) the AddKeys ToAgent directive in ssh_config ( 5 ) for more information . Keyboard - interactive authentication works as follows : The server sends an arbitrary \" challenge \" text and prompts for a response , possibly multiple times . Examples of keyboard - interactive authentication include BSD Authentication ( see login.conf ( 5 ) ) and PAM ( some non - OpenBSD systems ) . Finally , if other authentication methods fail , ssh prompts the user for a password . The password is sent to the remote host for checking ; however , since all communications are encrypted , the password cannot be seen by someone listening on the network . ssh automatically maintains and checks a database containing identification for all hosts it has ever been used with . Host keys are stored in ~\/.ssh\/known_hosts in the user 's home directory . Additionally , the file \/ etc \/ ssh \/ ssh_known_hosts is automatically checked for known hosts . Any new hosts are automatically added to the user 's file . If a host 's identification ever changes , ssh warns about this and disables password authentication to prevent server spoofing or man-in - the - middle attacks , which could otherwise be used to circumvent the encryption . The StrictHostKey Checking option can be used to control logins to machines whose host key is not known or has changed . When the user 's identity has been accepted by the server , the server either executes the given command in a non-interactive session or , if no command has been specified , logs into the machine and gives the user a normal shell as an interactive session . All communication with the remote command or shell will be automatically encrypted . If an interactive session is requested , ssh by default will only request a pseudo-terminal ( pty ) for interactive sessions when the client has one . The flags - T and -t can be used to override this behaviour . If a pseudo-terminal has been allocated , the user may use the escape characters noted below . If no pseudo-terminal has been allocated , the session is transparent and can be used to reliably transfer binary data . On most systems , setting the escape character to \u201c none \u201d will also make the session transparent even if a tty is used . The session terminates when the command or shell on the remote machine exits and all X11 and TCP connections have been closed . When a pseudo-terminal has been requested , ssh supports a number of functions through the use of an escape character . A single tilde character can be sent as EscapeChar configuration directive or on the command line by the -e option . ~~ or by following the tilde by a character other than those described below . The escape character must always follow a newline to be interpreted as special . The escape character can be changed in configuration files using the The supported escapes ( assuming the default ' ~ ' ) are : ~. ~^ Z ssh . ~# ~& sshat logout when waiting for forwarded connection \/ X11 sessions to terminate . ~? ~ B ~ C - L , - Rand - Doptions ( see above ) . It also allows the cancellation of existing port-forwardings with - KL[ bind_address : ] port for local , - KR [ bind_address : ] port for remote and -KD [ bind_address : ] port for dynamic port-forwardings . ! command allows the user to execute a local command if the PermitLocal Commandoption is enabled in ssh_config ( 5 ) . Basic help is available , using the - hoption . ~ R ~ V LogLevel ) when errors are being written to stderr . ~v LogLevel ) when errors are being written to stderr . Forwarding of arbitrary TCP connections over a secure channel can be specified either on the command line or in a configuration file . One possible application of TCP forwarding is a secure connection to a mail server ; another is going through firewalls . In the example below , we look at encrypting communication for an IRC client , even though the IRC server it connects to does not directly support encrypted communication . This works as follows : the user connects to the remote host using ssh , specifying the ports to be used to forward the connection . After that it is possible to start the program locally , and ssh will encrypt and forward the connection to the remote server . The following example tunnels an IRC session from the client to an IRC server at \u201c server.example.com \u201d , joining channel \u201c #users \u201d , nickname \u201c pinky \u201d , using the standard IRC port , 6667 : $ ssh -f -L 6667:localhost :6667 server.example.com sleep 10 $ irc -c ' #users ' pinky IRC\/127.0.0.1 The -f option backgrounds ssh and the remote command \u201c sleep 10 \u201d is specified to allow an amount of time ( 10 seconds , in the example ) to start the program which is going to use the tunnel . If no connections are made within the time specified , ssh will exit . If the Forward X11 variable is set to \u201c yes \u201d ( or see the description of the - X , -x , and - Y options above ) and the user is using X11 ( the DISPLAY environment variable is set ) , the connection to the X11 display is automatically forwarded to the remote side in such a way that any X11 programs started from the shell ( or command ) will go through the encrypted channel , and the connection to the real X server will be made from the local machine . The user should not manually set DISPLAY . Forwarding of X11 connections can be configured on the command line or in configuration files . The DISPLAY value set by ssh will point to the server machine , but with a display number greater than zero . This is normal , and happens because ssh creates a \u201c proxy \u201d X server on the server machine for forwarding the connections over the encrypted channel . ssh will also automatically set up Xauthority data on the server machine . For this purpose , it will generate a random authorization cookie , store it in Xauthority on the server , and verify that any forwarded connections carry this cookie and replace it by the real cookie when the connection is opened . The real authentication cookie is never sent to the server machine ( and no cookies are sent in the plain ) . If the Forward Agent variable is set to \u201c yes \u201d ( or see the description of the - A and - a options above ) and the user is using an authentication agent , the connection to the agent is automatically forwarded to the remote side . When connecting to a server for the first time , a fingerprint of the server 's public key is presented to the user ( unless the option StrictHost Key Checking has been disabled ) . Fingerprints can be determined using ssh-keygen ( 1 ) : $ ssh-keygen -l -f \/ etc \/ ssh\/ ssh_host_rsa_key If the fingerprint is already known , it can be matched and the key can be accepted or rejected . If only legacy ( MD5 ) fingerprints for the server are available , the ssh-keygen ( 1 ) - E option may be used to downgrade the fingerprint algorithm to match . Because of the difficulty of comparing host keys just by looking at fingerprint strings , there is also support to compare host keys visually , using random art . By setting the VisualHost Key option to \u201c yes \u201d , a small ASCII graphic gets displayed on every login to a server , no matter if the session itself is interactive or not . By learning the pattern a known server produces , a user can easily find out that the host key has changed when a completely different pattern is displayed . Because these patterns are not unambiguous however , a pattern that looks similar to the pattern remembered only gives a good probability that the host key is the same , not guaranteed proof . To get a listing of the fingerprints along with their random art for all known hosts , the following command line can be used : $ ssh-keygen - lv -f ~\/.ssh\/known_hosts If the fingerprint is unknown , an alternative method of verification is available : SSH fingerprints verified by DNS . An additional resource record ( RR ) , SSHFP , is added to a zonefile and the connecting client is able to match the fingerprint with that of the key presented . In this example , we are connecting a client to a server , \u201c host.example.com \u201d . The SSHFP resource records should first be added to the zonefile for host.example.com : $ ssh-keygen -r host.example.com . The output lines will have to be added to the zonefile . To check that the zone is answering fingerprint queries : $ dig -t SSHFP host.example.com Finally the client connects : $ ssh -o \" VerifyHostKeyDNS ask \" host.example.com [...] Matching host key fingerprint found in DNS . Are you sure you want to continue connecting ( yes \/ no ) ? See the VerifyHostKeyDNS option in ssh_config ( 5 ) for more information . ssh contains support for Virtual Private Network ( VPN ) tunnelling using the tun ( 4 ) network pseudo-device , allowing two networks to be joined securely . The sshd_config ( 5 ) configuration option PermitTunnel controls whether the server supports this , and at what level ( layer 2 or 3 traffic ) . The following example would connect client network 10.0.50.0\/24 with remote network 10.0.99.0\/24 using a point- to - point connection from 10.1.1.1 to 10.1.1.2 , provided that the SSH server running on the gateway to the remote network , at 192.168.1.15 , allows it . On the client : # ssh -f -w 0:1 192.168.1.15 true # ifconfig tun0 10.1.1.1 10.1.1.2 netmask 255.255.255.252 # route add 10.0.99.0\/24 10.1.1.2 On the server : # ifconfig tun 1 10.1.1.2 10.1.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.252 # route add 10.0.50.0\/24 10.1.1.1 Client access may be more finely tuned via the \/ root \/.ssh \/ authorized_keys file ( see below ) and the PermitRootLogin server option . The following entry would permit connections on tun ( 4 ) device 1 from user \u201c jane \u201d and on tun device 2 from user \u201c john \u201d , if PermitRootLogin is set to \u201c forced - commands - only \u201d : tunnel= \" 1 \" , command = \" sh \/ etc \/ netstart tun 1 \" ssh-rsa ... jane tunnel= \" 2 \" , command = \" sh \/ etc \/ netstart tun 2 \" ssh-rsa ... john Since an SSH - based setup entails a fair amount of overhead , it may be more suited to temporary setups , such as for wireless VPNs . More permanent VPNs are better provided by tools such as ipsecctl ( 8 ) and isakmpd ( 8 ) . ssh will normally set the following environment variables : DISPLAY DISPLAYvariable indicates the location of the X11 server . It is automatically set by sshto point to a value of the form \u201c hostname: n \u201d , where \u201c hostname \u201d indicates the host where the shell runs , and 'n ' is an integer \u2265 1 . sshuses this special value to forward X11 connections over the secure channel . The user should normally not set DISPLAYexplicitly , as that will render the X11 connection insecure ( and will require the user to manually copy any required authorization cookies ) . HOME LOGNAME USER ; set for compatibility with systems that use this variable . PATH PATH , as specified when compiling ssh . SSH_ASKPASS sshneeds a passphrase , it will read the passphrase from the current terminal if it was run from a terminal . If sshdoes not have a terminal associated with it but DISPLAY and SSH_ASKPAS Sare set , it will execute the program specified by SSH_ASKPASSand open an X11 window to read the passphrase . This is particularly useful when calling sshfrom a .xsession or related script . ( Note that on some machines it may be necessary to redirect the input from \/ dev \/ null to make this work . ) SSH_ASKPASS_REQUIRE sshwill never attempt to use one . If it is set to \u201c prefer \u201d , then sshwill prefer to use the askpass program instead of the TTY when requesting passwords . Finally , if the variable is set to \u201c force \u201d , then the askpass program will be used for all passphrase input regardless of whether DISPLAYis set . SSH_AUTH_SOCK SSH_CONNECTION SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND SSH_TTY SSH_TUNNEL SSH_USER_AUTH TZ USER Additionally , ssh reads ~\/.ssh \/environment , and adds lines of the format \u201c VARNAME=value \u201d to the environment if the file exists and users are allowed to change their environment . For more information , see the PermitUserEnvironment option in sshd_config ( 5 ) . sshwill simply ignore a private key file if it is accessible by others . It is possible to specify a passphrase when generating the key which will be used to encrypt the sensitive part of this file using AES - 128 . sshwhen the user logs in , just before the user 's shell ( or command ) is started . See the sshd ( 8 ) manual page for more information . sshwhen the user logs in , just before the user 's shell ( or command ) is started .

Det finns inte heller n\u00e5got bel\u00e4gg f\u00f6r att judar slagit sig ner h\u00e4r under medeltiden . F\u00f6re 1685 fanns inga i lag utsatta hinder f\u00f6r judar att bos\u00e4tta sig i Sverige , men ville en jude stanna i landet m\u00e5ste han l\u00e5ta d\u00f6pa sig . 1686 best\u00e4mdes i kyrkolag att judar som ville bos\u00e4tta sig i Sverige m\u00e5ste \u00f6verg\u00e5 till kristendomen ( den lutherska l\u00e4ran ) och l\u00e5ta d\u00f6pa sig . Detta g\u00e4llde fram till 1774 . D\u00e5 anl\u00e4nde Aaron Isaac , som skulle bli den f\u00f6rste svenske juden med r\u00e4tt att bo h\u00e4r utan att vara tvungen att l\u00e5ta d\u00f6pa sig . Han kom fr\u00e5n Mecklenburg , d\u00e4r han f\u00f6rs\u00f6rjt sig som sigillgrav\u00f6r och aff\u00e4rsman . Sverige fick nu sina f\u00f6rsta s k skyddsjudar och Aaron Isaac kunde grunda en judisk f\u00f6rsamling i Stockholm . Inte s\u00e5 l\u00e5ngt d\u00e4refter tillkom en judisk f\u00f6rsamling i Marstrand , som d\u00e5 var en frihamn och allts \u00e5 \u00f6ppen f\u00f6r fr\u00e4mmande trosbek\u00e4nnare . Fr\u00e5n den f\u00f6rsamlingen som lades ned 1794 , d\u00e5 Marstrand upph\u00f6rde att vara frihamn , h\u00e4rstammar \u00e5tskilliga k\u00e4nda judiska g\u00f6teborgssl\u00e4kter . \u00c5r 1782 utf\u00e4rdades det s k judereglementet , som under mer \u00e4n 50 \u00e5rs tid skulle bli best\u00e4mmande f\u00f6r de svenska judarnas st\u00e4llning . Det inneh\u00e5ller en m\u00e4ngd begr\u00e4nsningar i judarnas politiska r\u00e4ttigheter , vidare i deras r\u00e4tt att v\u00e4lja vistelseort och att ut\u00f6va hantverk och handel . Judarna kunde exempelvis inte bli riksdagsm\u00e4n eller tj\u00e4nstem\u00e4n . I egenskap av \u201d okristne \u201d kunde de inte vittna inf\u00f6r domstol . De fick inte gifta sig med andra \u00e4n trosf\u00f6rvanter . De fick till en b\u00f6rjan bara bo i Stockholm , G\u00f6teborg och Norrk\u00f6ping . Endast i dessa st\u00e4der kunde de \u00e4ga fastighet och ut\u00f6va handel . De flesta hantverk var f\u00f6rbjudna f\u00f6r judar . Det var f\u00f6rst 1838 som judarnas undantagsst\u00e4llning i princip upph\u00e4vdes . Detta skedde genom en kunglig f\u00f6rordning \u201d ang\u00e5ende mosaiska trosbek\u00e4nnares skyldigheter och r\u00e4ttigheter i riket \u201d . Judarna som dittills betraktats som en fr\u00e4mlingskoloni skulle h\u00e4danefter vara att likst\u00e4lla med \u00f6vriga svenskar . Den officiella ben\u00e4mningen skulle vara mosaiska trosbek\u00e4nnare . Vissa kvarst\u00e5ende inskr\u00e4nkningar i judarnas r\u00e4ttigheter upph\u00e4vdes under 1850 - och 1860 - talen . Ett riksdagsbeslut 1870 innebar att de svenska judarna efter n\u00e4ra 100 \u00e5r i allt v\u00e4sentligt beviljats fullst\u00e4ndiga medborgerliga r\u00e4ttigheter . Den judiska befolkningsutvecklingen \u00c5r 1838 fanns det omkring 900 judar h\u00e4r i landet ; av dem bodde ungef\u00e4r 800 i Stockholm och G\u00f6teborg . \u00c5r 1880 hade antalet judar vuxit till omkring 3 000 , framf\u00f6r allt som en f\u00f6ljd av invandring fr\u00e5n \u00d6steuropa . Vid en folkr\u00e4kning som \u00e4gde rum 1930 var antalet judar i runt tal 7 000 . Under tiden fram till krigsutbrottet 1939 tog Sverige emot 3 000 judar fr\u00e5n bl a Tyskland , ett f\u00f6rh\u00e5llandevis litet antal beroende p\u00e5 en restriktiv flyktingpolitik . Genom olika aktioner under 1945 och 1946 , bl a av Svenska R\u00f6da Korset , r\u00e4ddades till Sverige ca 10 000 judiska koncentrationsl\u00e4gerf\u00e5ngar . Av dessa kan en tredjedel antas ha blivit kvar i Sverige . En viss invandring har d\u00e4refter skett i samband med politiska omv\u00e4lvningar i Centraleuropa under 1950 - , 1960 - och 1970 - talen . I dag ber\u00e4knar man antalet judar h\u00e4r i landet till ca 17 000 , varav ungef\u00e4r h\u00e4lften bor i Stockholmsregionen . Judarnas anpassning till det svenska samh\u00e4llet D\u00e5 nyheten spred sig att Aaron Isaac f\u00e5tt tillst\u00e5nd att bos\u00e4tta sig i Sverige blev reaktionen s\u00e5 h\u00e4ftig att han under f\u00f6rsta tiden inte v\u00e5gade visa sig ute . \u00d6ver huvud taget fick den f\u00f6rsta generationens judar k\u00e4nna p\u00e5 den fientliga st\u00e4mningen , s\u00e4rskilt fr\u00e5n kretsar inom borgerskapet som befarade intr\u00e5ng i sina n\u00e4ringsf\u00e5ng . Ett par decennier in p\u00e5 1800 - talet f\u00f6rb\u00e4ttrades f\u00f6rh\u00e5llandena under inflytande av liberala id\u00e9er , och judarna f\u00e5r uppleva betydande framsteg f\u00f6r anpassningen i och med judereglementets upph\u00e4vande och judarnas formella inlemmande i det svenska samh\u00e4llet . I forts\u00e4ttningen sker undan f\u00f6r undan en fullst\u00e4ndig politisk och social frig\u00f6relse f\u00f6r den svenska judenheten . M\u00e5nga svensk- judiska familjer v\u00e4xer helt in i det svenska samh\u00e4llet . Assimilationen tar fart med m\u00e5nga bland\u00e4ktenskap som en f\u00f6ljd . F\u00f6rsamlingstillh\u00f6righet blir f\u00f6r m\u00e5nga mer ett socialt ansvar \u00e4n en religi\u00f6s f\u00f6rbundenhet . Den av Theodor Herzl 1897 grundade judiska folkr\u00f6relsen , zionismen , vars m\u00e5l var att f\u00f6rverkliga tanken p\u00e5 ett hemland f\u00f6r det judiska folket i det gamla Palestina , omfattas av m\u00e5nga svenska judar . Tillkomsten av staten Israel 1948 medf\u00f6r ocks \u00e5 en vitalisering av det judiska livet i Sverige och ett st\u00e4rkande av den judiska sj\u00e4lvk\u00e4nslan . De svenska judarnas bidrag till samh\u00e4llsutvecklingen Under de drygt 200 \u00e5r judarna f\u00e5tt bo i Sverige har de p\u00e5 m\u00e5nga olika s\u00e4tt berikat det svenska samh\u00e4llet inom konst , litteratur , vetenskap , handel och n\u00e4ringsliv . M\u00e5nga av de tidigaste invandrarna var g\u00e5rdfarihandlare , en verksamhet som f\u00f6r en del kom att leda till att dessa s\u00e5 sm\u00e5ningom blev antikvitetshandlare . I slutet av 1700 - talet etablerades kattuntryckerier , som utvecklades till textilindustrier . Betydande kattuntryckare var bland andra Heyman Sch\u00fcck , Aron Levi Lamm och Jacob Marcus . Medlemmar av judiska k\u00f6pmannasl\u00e4kter har gjort stora insatser f\u00f6r svenskt n\u00e4ringsliv , exempelvis familjerna Lamm , Josephson och Sachs i Stockholm , Mannheimer och Magnus i G\u00f6teborg och familjen Philipson i Norrk\u00f6ping . August Abrahamson och Otto Salomon drev det ber\u00f6mda sl\u00f6jdseminariet p\u00e5 N\u00e4\u00e4s i V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland . H\u00e4r fick bl a svenska folkskoll\u00e4rare sin utbildning i sl\u00f6jd . Bland v\u00e4lk\u00e4nda judiska konstn\u00e4rer m\u00e4rks bl a Geskel Saloman , Ernst Josephson , Hanna Pauli , Charlotte Mannheimer , Eva Bonnier , Isaac Gr\u00fcnewald och Endre Nemes . Judiska mecenater och donatorer har i h\u00f6g grad bidragit till samh\u00e4llsutvecklingen . Bland dessa kan s\u00e4rskilt n\u00e4mnas Pontus F\u00fcrstenberg och Ernest Thiel . Utan dessa m\u00e4nniskors intresse och generositet torde t ex m\u00e5nga av v\u00e5ra svenska konstn\u00e4rer inte haft s\u00e5 stor m\u00f6jlighet att utvecklas . Stockholms konserthus och G\u00f6teborgs universitet har f\u00f6r sin tillkomst bl a att tacka donationer av svenska judar . Best\u00e5ende insatser p\u00e5 det sociala omr\u00e5det har gjorts av bl a Oscar , Isaac och Axel Hirsch . M\u00e5nga judar har innehaft officiella uppdrag . S\u00e5 t ex var i slutet av 1800 - talet en femtedel av G\u00f6teborgs stadsfullm\u00e4ktige judar . Aron Philipson fr\u00e5n G\u00f6teborg och Moritz Rubenson fr\u00e5n Stockholm blev 1873 de f\u00f6rsta judiska riksdagsm\u00e4nnen . Det moderna bankv\u00e4sendet grundades under medverkan av Theodor Mannheimer fr\u00e5n G\u00f6teborg . Henrik Davidson var en av f\u00f6rgrundsgestalterna i Skandinaviska Kredit AB och en betydande finansman . Herman Mannheimer och Olof Aschberg \u00e4r andra k\u00e4nda namn inom finansv\u00e4rlden . Flera litteraturhistoriker av judisk b\u00f6rd har verkat i Sverige : Henrik Sch\u00fcck , Martin Lamm - b\u00e5da ledam\u00f6ter av Svenska Akademien - Karl Warburg och inte minst Oscar Levertin , som ocks \u00e5 var f\u00f6rfattare och poet . Bland andra judiska diktare b\u00f6r nobelpristagarinnan Nelly Sachs s\u00e4rskilt n\u00e4mnas . Andra judiska kulturpersonligheter som Moses Pergament ( komposit\u00f6r ) , Hugo Valentin ( historiker ) , Eli Heckscher ( nationalekonom och historiker ) och Albert Bonnier ( bokf\u00f6rl\u00e4ggare ) har alla p\u00e5 sitt omr\u00e5de gjort betydelsefulla insatser i det svenska samh\u00e4llet . Religi\u00f6sa riktningar Under l\u00e5nga tider levde m\u00e5nga judar i vissa delar av Europa isolerade fr\u00e5n sina v\u00e4rdfolk . Den helt f\u00f6rh\u00e4rskande religi\u00f6sa riktningen i dessa gettomilj\u00f6er var den s k ortodoxa ( traditionella ) judendomen . Den k\u00e4nnetecknas av ett str\u00e4ngt iakttagande av de regler och bud som f\u00f6reskrivs i Toran och andra religi\u00f6sa k\u00e4llor . De judar som invandrade till Sverige fr\u00e5n \u00d6steuropa under senare h\u00e4lften av 1800 - talet och n\u00e5got decennium in p\u00e5 1900 - talet tillh\u00f6rde i allm\u00e4nhet den ortodoxa riktningen . De ortodoxa judarna i dagens Sverige , till antalet kanske tio procent av hela den svenska judenheten , h\u00e4rstammar till stor del fr\u00e5n dessa invandrare . Ortodoxa synagogor finns i Stockholm , G\u00f6teborg och Malm\u00f6 . De \u00e4ldre svensk- judiska sl\u00e4kterna har i stor utstr\u00e4ckning assimilerats i det svenska samh\u00e4llet och i samband d\u00e4rmed avl\u00e4gsnat sig fr\u00e5n den ortodoxa livsstilen . Dessa och de \u00f6vriga svenska judar som inte r\u00e4knar sig som ortodoxa h\u00f6r hemma i den sk konservativa ( ibland kallad den liberala ) judendomen . Denna riktning avviker i m\u00e5nga stycken fr\u00e5n den ortodoxa och inneb\u00e4r en anpassning till det omgivande samh\u00e4llet . I f\u00f6rh\u00e5llande till de ortodoxa synagogorna \u00e4r t ex liturgin i de konservativa synagogorna avkortad , vissa b\u00f6ner l\u00e4ses p\u00e5 svenska i st\u00e4llet f\u00f6r hebreiska och orgel kan komma till anv\u00e4ndning i gudstj\u00e4nsten . De stora synagogorna i Stockholm och G\u00f6teborg kan betecknas som konservativa i denna mening .

In an evaporative system , atmospheric parameters ( humidity and isotopic composition of water vapor ) have strong influence on the isotopic behavior of saline lakes , and in a freezing system , salinity build - up largely controls the extent of freezing and associated isotope fractionation . In both systems , salinity has a direct impact on the isotopic evolution of saline lakes . It is proposed that a steady - state \" terminal lake \" model with short - term hydrologic and environmental perturbations can serve as a useful framework for investigating both evaporative and freezing processes of perennial saline lakes . Through re-assessment of own work and literature data for saline lakes , it was demonstrated that effective uses of the isotope activity compositions of brines and salinity - chemistry data could reveal dynamic changes and evolution in the isotopic compositions of saline lakes in response to hydrologic and environmental changes . The residence time of isotopic water molecules in lakes determines the nature of responses in the isotopic compositions following perturbations in the water and isotope balances ( e.g. , dilution by inflow , water deficit by increased evaporation , and \/ or reduction in inflow ) . The isotopic profiles of some saline lakes from the Polar regions show that they switched the two contrasting modes of operation between evaporative and freezing systems , in response to climate and hydrological changes in the past ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Both pilots had loosened their harnesses , and Lancaster was forcefully pulled toward the open window by the rush of air .

So I thought I 'd do a bit more . What Eurostat gives us are budget balances in euroland as a percentage of GDP . Kash focuses on the change from 2009 to 2011 as an indicator of austerity , although as he notes , falling GDP means that the true amount of austerity in places like Greece is much bigger than that . Let 's run with that , and create a crude adjusted measure of austerity . I calculate the amount the budget balance \u201c should \u201d have changed as 0.45 * ( growth from 2009 to 2011 \u2013 4 ) . In this formula , 0.45 is the average share of government revenue in GDP in the euro area , so this is a rough measure of revenue effects of growth ; I 'm just assuming that 4 percent would represent normal growth for a euro country over 2 years . And I estimate austerity as the difference between the actual change in budget balance and this predicted change . So this is a kind of Cary Brown computation . It 's also sort of what Alesina and Ardagna do , but applied to a period in which big moves in deficits are clearly driven by austerity policies , so the many objections to their work do n't have their usual force . What do we get if we plot this estimated austerity against the actual change in real GDP 2009 to 2011 ? An apparent multiplier of around 1.25 , not out of line with other estimates . It 's worth noting that this also implies that 1 euro of austerity yields only about 0.4 euros of reduced deficit , even in the short run .

Lots of people came back on the night of January 13th , the day before the plug was pulled on the online servers . It 's a pity we 'll never be able to play it online again , but it 'll continue to live on in my house for offline play . Not everything was perfect about the game . There were elements that worked in the game 's favor , and elements that did n't . It seems like Mr. Jaffe understands this now . Experience is one heck of a teacher . Anyway , I just want to wrap it up by saying thanks to David and the rest of the team that worked hard to create this great game . - botcocker speaks the truth Posted : Feb 17 , 2010 12:00 AM PST by Gconnection A flash of brilliance is just that , a flash . You take advantage of the moment and you go down as a legend for that moment . This guy helped to create one of the most compelling videogames of our time . His legacy is the myriad GOW clones on the market . It takes a lot to come up with something original these days . People still do , but they are few and far between . Kudos to this guy for having the balls to admit a mistake . That means more to me than any perceived failure he has conceded . - @halochief_90 Posted : Feb 17 , 2010 12:00 AM PST by Hey_its_that_dog Since Jaffe ca n't say it , I will : Fuck you . You 're nobody . If nobody cares what HE has to say , I ca n't imagine there 's any reason for you to post YOUR opinion . - Who Cares ? Posted : Feb 17 , 2010 12:00 AM PST by halochief _90 Here 's news for ya Jaffe : Most people forgot about this game two years ago . You ca n't seem to get it off your mind . Why should Jaffe be giving advice on DLC of a three year - old game when the market is completely different now ? The real mistake is assuming anyone cares about what you say anymore . - @ Xvoid6 f Posted : Feb 17 , 2010 12:00 AM PST by botcocker I agree that making a great game does n't make someone a \" god \" , but at the same time let 's not ignore the fact that some creators do have more talent , vision , or ability than others , and can achieve things that others ca n't . Of course that does n't make them perfect ; they will make mistakes , possibly big mistakes , but since they 've demonstrated a capacity for greatness in the past it 's not unreasonable for people to continue to expect great things from them . What maybe is n't considered so much is the fact that a great achievement is as much a product of its historical context as those key individuals , and sometimes when that moment has passed that 's it and those people may never achieve that level of greatness again . - Gods Posted : Feb 17 , 2010 12:00 AM PST by Xvoid6 f People would like to make Gods out of ordinary people . Because David Jaffe worked on God of War does n't make him that much greater than everyone else . Same goes for Lord British or John Carmack . As for Ultima -- there were a ton of nerds out there who wanted \/ demanded role - playing games . It is the demand and desire by the people which makes games popular -- it is n't the case that the world should think it is \" blessed \" to have received Richard Garriott . As for John Carmack -- all I can say about him is that he was ahead of his time , but just by a bit . If it was n't him who spearheaded all of the 3D technology back in the early 90s , then it would have been some other guy . So we see David Jaffe failing at a game after God of War , Richard Garriott failing at Tabula Rasa , and John Carmack without a runaway hit like Doom and Quake were back in the day . No single person is the reason for a game 's success . Quit acting surprised or shocked when these \" Gods \" fail at creating new games . - I liked that mistake Posted : Feb 17 , 2010 12:00 AM PST by DrMnike CAC was the only game I played with other 3 friends at the same screen and had a blast . too bad this blast only lasted a couple of hours because this friends were from Israel and did not have a PS3 to continue playing through PSN Network . Most of the time the network did not find any player . - Great little snippit Posted : Feb 17 , 2010 12:00 AM PST by nochildren It 's very refreshing to see that Jaffe 's not afraid to admit his mistakes . A lot of these game \" celebrities \" just hype their product into the stratisphere then move on to the next project without ever ( openly ) reflecting on how they could have done better . - NBA Jam had a \" hardcore gameplay mechanic \" ? Posted : Feb 17 , 2010 12:00 AM PST by danzego Well , that 's a new one . That game was as aimed at the mainstream as anything could possibly be back in the day . Jaffe considers that \" hardcore gameplay \" ? No wonder Calling All Cars failed - the creator of the game does n't have a frickin ' clue anymore .

However, I believe what has been made clear is if any Canadians go abroad to a democratic country where there is the rule of law, they cannot be guaranteed that Canada will intervene if they become multiple or mass murderers.\nAgain, we want to send a message out to anyone who is in the business of being a mass murderer or a multiple murderer in a democratic country where there is a rule of law that they cannot necessarily count on the assistance of the Canadian government.\n\u2022 Nov. 22\nWe have indicated that individuals who commit multiple murders or mass murders abroad in a democratic country that adheres to the rule of law cannot necessarily count on the Canadian government to claim clemency and patriation back to this country.\nWhat we have indicated, though, and I will repeat this for the honourable member, is that multiple murderers and mass murderers who are convicted in a democracy that adheres to the rule of law cannot necessarily count on a plea for clemency from the Canadian government and patriation back to this country.

A large class of irrational \" almost integers \" can be found using the theory of modular functions , and a few rather spectacular examples are given by Ramanujan ( 1913 - 14 ) . Such approximations were also studied by Hermite ( 1859 ) , Kronecker ( 1863 ) , and Smith ( 1965 ) . They can be generated using some amazing ( and very deep ) properties of the j-function . Some of the numbers which are closest approximations to integers are ( sometimes known as the Ramanujan constant and which corresponds to the field which has class number 1 and is the imaginary quadratic field of maximal discriminant ) , , , and , the last three of which have class number 2 and are due to Ramanujan ( Berndt 1994 , Waldschmidt 1988 ab ) . The properties of the j-function also give rise to the spectacular identity ( 58 ) ( Le Lionnais 1983 , p. 152 ; Trott 2004 , p. 8 ) .

Here , the excesses can be computed as exact sums connected by a recurrence relation , with the first few being ( 74 ) ( 75 ) ( Maze and Minder 2005 ) . These sums can also be done in closed form using q-polygamma functions , giving for example ( 76 ) ( 77 ) with . An amusing almost integer involving units of length is given by ( 78 ) If combinations of physical and mathematical constants are allowed and taken in SI units , the following quantities have a near-integer numeric prefactor ( 79 ) ( 80 ) ( M.

Despite promises of a free voice for the people , the Islamic government of Iran has been the dominion of religious clerics since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 . The establishment of the Council of Guardians in the constitution of 1980 assured the dominance of clerics within Iranian politics . [ 2 ] The Council of Guardians assumed oversight of the Majles and presidential elections in 1984 , while Ayatollah Khomeini held power over the executive and judicial branches of the Iranian government . Together , Khomeini and the Council of Guardians kept the Iranian government firmly under the rule of Muslim conservatives , particularly clerics . As revolutionary fervor declined and the pains of war began to wear on the people of Iran through the 1980s , the popularity of conservative rule in Iran began to waver . Upon Khomeini 's death in 1989 , the grip of the conservatives lessened further . [ 3 ] Although the power of the conservatives faded during the 1980s and 1990s , they remain reluctant to relinquish power at the start of the twenty - first century . As a new generation of post -Revolutionary Iranians matures , movements for greater individual liberties and growing secularism threaten the position of the conservatives . With the election of reformist President Mohammad Khatami in 1997 , the Iranian people announced their dissatisfaction with fundamentalist rule . [ 4 ] In the year 2000 , the election of the Sixth Majles has confirmed the Iranian people 's desire to end the rule of the conservatives . While the Majles has not wielded great political power in the years following the revolution , election results since 1980 suggest the emphatic backlash against conservative rule in the 2000 elections is the culmination of a pattern of discontent among the people of Iran . This view is vividly illustrated through an examination of the number of clerics elected to the Iranian Majles since 1980 . To understand the implications of Majles elections since the Islamic Revolution , it is necessary to examine the structure of Iranian elections as constructed by the Revolutionary constitution prior to the 1980 elections . According to the election law of February 6 , 1980 , Iranian citizens age sixteen and older are eligible to vote . [ 5 ] Approximately every four years , eligible citizens elect candidates to the 270 member Majles . The voters select among all candidates meeting the qualifications set forth by the constitution : candidates must be literate Iranian citizens between ages 25 and 85 , with no record of \u201c moral corruption , \u201d and a profound belief in the tenets of the Islamic Revolution . [ 6 ] To ensure the dominance of pro-Revolutionary politicians , the Council of Guardians screens the credentials of all prospective candidates . Those candidates receiving an absolute majority are elected directly to the Majles , while those remaining move on to a later runoff election for the remaining seats . While the attempts of conservative clerics to control the election process were initially successful , later elections challenged their authority . The first Majles elections held in Iran after the Islamic Revolution occurred on March 14 , 1980 . [ 7 ] Amidst the fervor of the Revolution , 6.1 million Iranians traveled to the polls to vote for the 2,500 candidates running for election to the Majles . [ 8 ] The Islamic Republican Party ( IRP ) , a party led by fundamentalist clerics , dominated the elections of 1980 . [ 9 ] The IRP took 131 of 216 seats in the First Majles . [ 10 ] In total , clerics assumed 137 of the 216 Majles seats in 1980 . [ 11 ] These results meant that clerics made up an astounding 63 % of representatives in the First Majles . Although this number was disproportionate to the number of clerics in Iran , it must be remembered that the Iranian people were scarcely removed from the passions of the Islamic Revolution . The Iranian people naturally gravitated toward the leaders of their recent revolution , handing the conservative clerics a resounding political victory . While the power of the Islamic Revolution was immense in Iran , the people gradually came to question conservative rule . Four years later , the influence of conservative clerics over the people of Iran remained strong . On April 15 , and May 17 , 1984 , elections for the Second Majles took place . [ 12 ] The Iranian people responded by electing 122 clerics to the Majles . [ 13 ] This represented an eleven percent decrease in the number of clerics elected in comparison to the First Majles . A number of factors occurred in the voting process between the 1980 and 1984 elections . Prior to the elections , the First Majles decreased the voting age from 16 to 15. [ 14 ] Also , the Council of Guardians acted as the oversight committee for the general election for the first time . [ 15 ] The assumption of election control by the Council of Guardians allowed for the elimination of liberal candidates prior to the election . [ 16 ] The ongoing war with Iraq buoyed support for conservatives who successfully \u201c waved the bloody shirt \u201d prior to the election . Perhaps the greatest influence precipitating the decrease in the election of clerics was an address made by Ayatollah Khomeini on February 29 , 1984 . Khomeini told the people of Iran that they should not feel obligated to vote only for clerics . Khomeini believed this practice to be an exclusionary one similar to the political manipulations of the Shah . [ 17 ] The election created a turnover of 61 % ( 164 members ) within the Majles suggesting dissatisfaction among the people of Iran for the work of the First Majles . [ 18 ] Although conservatives won the day , the drop in the election of clerics suggested a wavering of clerical rule . While the drop in clerical participation in the Second Majles was not catastrophic , the results of the 1984 elections foreshadowed future events . As in 1984 , the ongoing war with Iraq served as a backdrop to national elections in 1988 . In 1988 , however , the war effected elections in almost every region of the country . Massive Iraqi missile attacks reached Tehran in the three weeks prior to the April 7 elections . [ 19 ] The intensity of the war with Iraq affected elections , resulting in a major victory for radical conservatives . Surprisingly , the result of war - weary Iranians heading to the polls was another loss for clerics in the Majles . In 1988 , only 77 clerics took seats in the Third Majles , a decrease of over 36 % . [ 20 ] Although the intensification of the war may have created an anomaly with the election of more conservatives , the results suggest a further decrease in political satisfaction among the Iranian people . Conservatives experienced a further decay in power with the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in June 1989 . Khomeini , the charismatic leader of the 1979 Islamic Revolution , was the true force behind the reign of the clerics . While his successor , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , proved capable , his popularity never rivaled that of Khomeini . The death of Khomeini , a significant blow to clerical dominance , proved to be a decisive factor in the elections for the Fourth Majles in 1992 . The Majles elections of 1992 illustrate the significance of losing Khomeini . Without Khomeini bolstering conservatism , Iranians began a push for reform . Not only questions of national economic policy , but also issues of personal liberty began to arise in the political debates preceding the 1992 elections . [ 21 ] At the polls , Iranians voiced their desire for change . The April 7 elections proved to be an unbridled success for anti-radical politicians . Moderates swept into the Majles promising economic reform . The makeup of the Majles became younger and more secularly educated , while a record number of women took seats . [ 22 ] Again , the power of the clerics slipped . The Iranian people elected only 65 clerics to the Fourth Majles in 1992 , a 4 % decrease compared to the 1988 election . [ 23 ] The defeat of the radicals and the continued decline in the number of clerics indicated that the people of Iran were tiring of conservative rule . This trend intensified in the elections for the Fifth Majles in 1996 . By the 1996 general elections , the people of Iran reached a critical point in their desire for liberalization . The ability of the Fourth Majles to pass moderate legislation suffered under the watch of the Council of Guardians , resulting in growing discontent among Iranians . Elections for the Fifth Majles on March 8 and April 19 witnessed fierce competition between conservatives and moderates . Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani led the moderate reformist push in the 1996 Majles elections . Rafsanjani 's message of moderation appealed to the Iranian people . Prior to the 1996 elections , Rafsanjani and his allies created the Servants of Construction \u2014 a loose political arrangement of moderate reformers hoping to create a coalition in the Fifth Majles . In the elections , Rafsanjani 's Servants of Construction managed to acquire 100 seats . [ 24 ] The clerics who once dominated the Majles found themselves with only 50 seats , a decrease of more than 5 % since the previous election . [ 25 ] The trend against conservatism continued after the 1996 elections , as the presidential election of 1997 yielded more progress for moderates . Mohammad Khatami assumed the Presidency on promises of greater freedom for economic innovation , the liberalization of the press , and the removal of restrictions on personal liberty . President Khatami quickly became a figure as wildly popular among Iran 's young people in the late 1990s as the Ayatollah Khomeini was in the late 1970s . Although Khatami did not possess the political power to institute promised reforms , his message inspired the Iranian people , particularly the young , to press conservatives for the liberties they desired . Following the astounding popularity of President Khatami , reformers seized commanding control of the Majles in the 2000 elections , further damaging the ability of clerics to dominate Iranian politics . The initial results of the February 18 elections suggested a clear desire for reform among the people of Iran . An estimated 80 % of eligible voters turned out to support the reform movement of President Khatami . [ 26 ] In the largest voting district of the country , Tehran , as many women were elected to the Sixth Majles as clerics . [ 27 ] The moderate reforms of Rafsanjani have given way to demands for previously unheard of liberalization of the government and society . This shift from moderation to liberalism is well illustrated by the performance of Rafsanjani in the 2000 elections . Rafsanjani almost failed to win a seat in the Sixth Majles , finishing thirtieth on Tehran ballots . [ 28 ] In the past three elections , the Majles has transformed from a stronghold of conservatism into a body comprised almost exclusively of moderate and liberal reformers . Following the second round of elections , the number of clerics sitting in the Sixth Majles dropped precipitously , as reformers captured almost 70 % of the seats . [ 29 ] The people of Iran , beleaguered by the intervention of the conservative government , used their voices at the ballot box in an attempt to institute revolutionary changes . After examining the trend in election results since 1980 , one must wonder what happened in Iran to dissipate the zeal of the Islamic Revolution in two decades . A change in the social makeup of Iran offers a possible explanation for the rise of the reform movement . Demographic changes that have occurred in Iran since the time of the Islamic Revolution are astounding and could account for the liberalization that has manifested itself in Majles elections . In 1976 , less than half of Iran 's inhabitants resided in urban areas . As of 1996 , the number of Iranians living in urban settings had increased to more than 61 % . [ 30 ] This growth has not been centered in a single region of the country ; rather , it has occurred uniformly across Iran . In 1976 , only twenty - three cities held populations of more than 100,000 . By 1996 , forty - seven cities had risen to a population of at least 100,000 . [ 31 ] The combination of rural migration and a natural population increase made the rapid rise of urbanization possible . With so many Iranians living within the limits of urban areas , access to government programs , most notably education , has increased dramatically . The literacy rate among Iranians ages six to twenty - four rose from 50 % in 1976 to over 93 % in 1996 . [ 32 ] The proliferation of education and its resulting social and political awareness surely contributed to increasing demands for political liberalization . Also contributing to this explosion of political activism is the youth of the Iranian population . The majority of Iran 's citizens were born after the 1979 Revolution . Estimates suggest that half of the population of Iran is under age 30. [ 33 ] The combination of these forces has produced a widely based push for greater liberalization of government and society . The results of the 2000 elections for the Sixth Majles are an exclamation point for the trend away from conservative rule in Iran . While the media has treated the results of the 2000 elections as a major turning point in Iranian politics , in actuality , it is the culmination of a trend in Majles elections that has been repeated since 1984 . Each election since the first revolutionary election in 1980 has witnessed a drop in the number of clerics elected to the Majles . Regardless of the underlying cause of liberalization in Iran , the Majles election results since 1980 reinforce the notion that the people of Iran are tired of the interference of the conservative regime . Shahram Chubin eloquently described the political evolution of Iran since 1980 , saying , Gone is the automatic support for the regime and the assumption of its good intentions . In part , this is the result of time and the graying of the original revolutionaries . In part , it is the result of the corruption , broken promises , and blame - passing by the regime 's leaders , who hold everyone but themselves responsible for the regime 's failures . The system has evolved , but not enough to accommodate the demands of society . [ 34 ] The conservatives still in power , particularly the clerics controlling the Council of Guardians , will have a great impact on the success of the reform movement . Yet despite their remaining power , the people of Iran have pushed open a door to reform that the conservatives are unlikely to close .

This is an issue that my colleague David Goodland\nand I first began exploring in March of 1999 after we both read through\nthe Gurney medical records at the Gurney Archive. The records, which\nwe had seen earlier at the City Archives in London, were not exactly\nthe fountain of new information we had anticipated but there were several\nthings in them that raised questions for us.\nThe medical records and censorship\nAfter reading the records, it becomes clear that\nthe doctors who treated Gurney did not know what was wrong with him.\nHis diagnosis upon admission to the City of London Mental Hospital in\nDecember 1922 was \"Delusional Insanity (Systematic)\" with\none entry noting that \"During the war Patient suffered from shell\nshock\". There is no documented evidence in these records supporting\nthe shell shock diagnosis.\nFurther, there is no diagnosis in the medical records\nto indicate that Gurney had syphilis. The word simply does not appear\nin these documents. However, the notion that he might have had syphilis\narises from the fact that he was treated with malarial injections in\n1923. At the time, malaria was the standard treatment for syphilis.\nThe other hint is in the fact that someone \u2014 my guess is the late William\nTrethowan \u2014 believed he had found a good reason to seal the medical\nrecords for 100 years after Gurney\u2019s death, which would effectively\nkeep them from the public until 2037. (Fortunately this restriction\nwas lifted in 1999.) While there is no direct proof that Trethowan is\nresponsible for this censorship, who else would have been in a position\nto make such a judgement? Who would have had the medical knowledge to\nunderstand the implication of malarial treatments? Who had access to\nthe medical records? Who based his own research on them? Who donated\nthe records to the Gurney Archive? William Trethowan, Professor of Psychiatry\nat the University of Birmingham.(2)\nThat 100-year blackout of Gurney\u2019s medical records\nalways troubled me and triggered suspicions that prompted questions.\nWhy would anyone deliberately seal the records unless there is something\nin them that might be embarrassing? What is in them that should be hidden\nfrom the public? The flip side of that coin is that the records could\nhave been sealed just because they dealt with mental illness and because\nthey sometimes graphically describe Gurney\u2019s condition. Even in the\nlate \u201970s and early \u201980s, mental illness bore a stigma that is not completely\nerased in the 21st Century and some people still regard it\nas a shameful condition. Indeed, I had spoken to a distant relative\nof Gurney\u2019s in Gloucester about five years ago. She had an elderly aunt\nor cousin more closely related to Gurney, who simply would not discuss\nGurney or his illness. This relative felt that his mental illness was\ntoo much of an embarrassment for the family.\nMalaria and syphilis\nFrom the hospital records, we can read about Gurney\u2019s\nbehavior and his hallucinations and his physical condition to a comparatively\nlimited degree. From 1926 to November 1935, he steadfastly refused to\nallow doctors to examine him physically. Only when he became too weak\nto resist would he allow doctors to touch him. Therefore, the observations\nin the medical records offer incomplete or at best only superficial\nevaluations of Gurney\u2019s physical condition. Letters written to Marion\nScott by Gurney\u2019s doctors are sometimes more illuminating. Some information\nis simply not in the records such as laboratory reports on blood work,\ndetails on the patient\u2019s daily activities, details on his physical condition,\nthe kind of detail that would be found in medical notes recorded today.\nTo the hospital authorities, Gurney was just another patient about whom\nhis care givers knew little as one entry in his records indicates: \"Said\nto have been assistant organist in Gloucester Cathedral and to have\nbeen a capable composer, and an approved poet\". However, although\npotentially important information is missing, the records do supply\nresults of urinalysis tests and reveal some of the medications he took\nand some of the treatments he was given for his various physical ailments.\nOne of those treatments was a \"mild form of\nMalaria\" administered to him in the summer of 1923. And it is this\ntreatment which points to Gurney having syphilis.\nWhile it is possible that Gurney\u2019s doctors might\nhave thought that syphilis was contributing to his mental problems,\nthey do not say so in his medical records. Thus, it is left to us to\nlook at what evidence there is to support the assumption that Gurney\nhad syphilis and to draw our own conclusions based on two questions.\nWhat physical complaints or symptoms did Gurney\nhave from the time entered the City of London Mental Hospital? How do\nthose symptoms correspond to the known stages of syphilis?\nGurney and sex\nWe must first establish a time-frame within which\nGurney might have contracted syphilis. Was it in 1913 when he had his\nfirst recorded breakdown, as has been suggested? Or even earlier in\nhis teens when he might have been the victim of sexual abuse? Or during\nhis time in France from May 1916 to September 1917? The latter period\nseems most likely given most soldiers\u2019 abundant sexual opportunities.\nGurney\u2019s sexuality was dismissed in Michael Hurd\u2019s biography, The\nOrdeal of Ivor Gurney, and it has been assumed ever since that \"sex\nsimply did not enter Gurney\u2019s calculations in any shape or form\".\nBut it did and it was a driving force in his life. And if Gurney is\nthought to have had syphilis, sex was certainly involved.\nGurney was not about to write of his sexual experiences\nin his letters to Marion Scott, the Hunt sisters, Ethel Voynich or other\nfriends, particularly if he were having relations with other men as\nwell as with women. If such letters did exist, it is likely that they\nwere destroyed upon receipt or later by well-meaning individuals seeking\nto protect and purify Gurney\u2019s image. We cannot pretend that Gurney\nwas not a sexual being or that he would shy away from enjoying sexual\npleasure. He patronized caf\u00e9s, drank beer, enjoyed the company\nof the French people. He admired the courage of the French women. He\nreports that he and his friend Basil Cridland spoke enough French \"to\nget what we want\". Are we to believe that Ivor Gurney, a passionate\nyoung man, spent 16 months in France abstaining from sex and denying\nhimself pleasure knowing he could be killed any day? Most men would\nmake the best of such a situation and indulge themselves whenever possible.\nWould Gurney be any different under the circumstances?\nThe symptoms of\nsyphilis\nOnce a time-frame is established, it is important\nto look closely at the course syphilis runs. The initial symptoms of\nthe disease, which usually appear within two weeks to three months after\ninfection, are ulcers or chancre sores on the genitals, rectum, mouth,\nfingers or other parts of the body and enlarged lymph nodes in the area\ncontaining the sores. The sores may be painless and heal in about 4\nto 8 weeks. Then the secondary symptoms come along anywhere from a week\nto six months later. These include skin rash characterized by brown\nsores the size of a penny, extensive lymph node enlargement, ulcerations\nof mucous membranes, headache, aches and pains in the bones, loss of\nappetite, fever, fatigue, patchy hair loss. The signs of this stage\nmay come and go for one to two years. Then there is a latent stage during\nwhich there are no symptoms but if the disease is untreated changes\nbegin to occur in the internal organs or in the cardiovascular and central\nnervous systems. Syphilis can remain latent for as long as 20 or 30\nyears before the tertiary stage appears. Then it gets nasty \u2014 ulcer-like\nsores appear on the skin, hard nodules occur in the tissue under the\nskin, in the mucous membranes and in various internal organs. Bones,\nthe liver, kidneys and other organs may be involved. The cardiovascular\nsystem can become infected sometimes causing an aortic aneurism and\nthe disease can affect the central nervous system and lead to mental\nillness.\nIf Gurney had picked up syphilis in 1913, or later\nduring his war service in France, the secondary stage would have been\nlong past by the time he entered the City of London Mental Hospital\nin 1922. Yet he was given the malarial treatment in the summer of 1923,\na year and a half after his admission and at a time when he was highly\ndelusional and praying \"continually for death\". The records\npertaining to Gurney\u2019s examinations prior to the malarial treatment\nindicate that Gurney had been \"ill (mentally) off and on since\n1917\" and that \"patient had ulceration of stomach some years ago\".\nThe only marks noted on his skin were scars on the back of his neck\nand on his left knee. There is no record of the kind of sores associated\nwith syphilis and no reference is made to enlarged glands. Gurney was,\nhowever, suffering from \"auditory hallucinations\" and insomnia\nand was thought to be suicidal. In late 1931, he was said to be enjoying\n\"satisfactory health\". As late as 1936 when Gurney was finally\nexamined by doctors, they found \"no aneurisms\" or abnormalities\nin his heart, lungs, and abdomen, which would surely have shown signs\nof degeneration by then if he had had syphilis.\nGurney\u2019s health in the asylum\nNot until March 1925, a year and a half after Gurney\nendured the malarial treatments, did the hospital physicians diagnose\nhim with a condition that syphilis might imitate, something that they\ndefined as \"evidently a scurvy\". Scurvy is a disease caused\nby a vitamin C deficiency. It\u2019s presence is first observed in the mouth\nwhere it causes inflammation and sponginess of the gums, which loosens\nteeth, bodily weakness and swollen and tender joints. If Gurney had\npicked up syphilis in 1913 or during the war, sores should have appeared\nin his mouth well before he ever entered the hospital. It would not\nbe surprising to find a condition like scurvy in Gurney whose eating\nhabits were appalling and indicative of a serious eating disorder that\nhad plagued him from early adulthood onward. Today, we might regard\nGurney as suffering from a form of bulemia.\nIn the asylum, Gurney also complained of pains\nin his head and we know that he must have suffered from other aches\nand pains as well. These complaints could be symptomatic of syphilis\nin its initial stages, just like the mouth sores, but they could just\nas easily be symptoms of a number of other ailments. Gurney also suffered\nfrom \"bad muscular rheumatism\" and was given \"special\ninfra red treatment\".(3) This condition, which was mentioned in\n1935 and 1936 had been present \"for some time\". While one\nof the treatments for syphilis did include \"raising the temperature\nof the body\" with radiant heat, the medical records say that this\ninfra red treatment was for the rheumatism. They do not say it was for\nsyphilis.\nAgain, it would not be unusual to find Gurney suffering\nfrom rheumatism, especially considering the physical hardship that he\nendured during his months at the Front. For example, in his letters,\nhe describes experiences like sleeping on bare boards covered only by\na damp blanket and that was during basic training. By the time he got\nto the Front, conditions were much worse. He was outdoors in all kinds\nof weather and was often freezing and wet. These miserable physical\nconditions would surely have an effect on him later in life and would\nmake him a very likely candidate for rheumatism and a host of other\nmuscle and joint ailments. Thus, the medical records seem to indicate\nthat the diagnoses of scurvy and rheumatism were completely separate\nfrom any possible diagnosis of syphilis and that none of the symptoms\nof these illnesses were stated by Gurney\u2019s doctors to be symptoms of\nsyphilis.\nLooking at the time frame again for the stages\nof syphilis, if Gurney had contracted syphilis in France during the\nwar, he should have been in the latent stage by 1922. If he had contracted\nit while a student at the Royal College of Music, he might have gone\nthrough the latent stage and have progressed to the tertiary stage by\n1922, but I don\u2019t think this is the case. If Gurney had reached the\ntertiary stage of syphilis by 1922, he would have begun a more pronounced\ndownward spiral with symptoms possibly affecting his heart, eyes, brain,\nnervous system, bones, joints, or just about any part of the body. This\nstage can last for years. The final stage of the disease can result\nin mental illness, blindness, neurological problems, heart disease and\nfinally, death. Gurney was not demented, a characteristic of neurosyphilis.\nHe could still reason and understand what was happening around him until\nthe very end of his life. He was able to write poetry at least until\n1929. He still read books and could communicate with Marion Scott about\nwhat he was reading well into the 1930s. Indeed, could a demented individual\nwrite\nAll night the fierce wind blew \u2014\nAll night I knew\nTime, like a dark wind, blowing\nAll days, all lives, all memories\nDown empty endless skies....\nWhen Helen Thomas, the widow of poet Edward Thomas\nvisited Gurney in the asylum in 1932, he knew who she was and understood\nher relationship to Edward. He talked with her and she found him \"generally\nquite sane and lucid\". This is not the behavior of a man suffering\nfrom syphilis-induced dementia.\nIf Gurney had neurosyphilis, he might have experienced\nthe following symptoms as the illness took hold of him: headache, stiff\nneck and fever, which result from an inflammation of the lining of the\nbrain; possible seizures, symptoms of stroke with numbness, weakness\nand visual complaints. Neurosyphilis can take up to 20 years to develop.\nBefore the advent of malarial treatments, neurosyphilis usually killed\nits victims in two to four years after it actually developed. Penicillin\nbegan replacing malaria as a treatment for syphilis in 1945. Today,\nmalaria is still considered an effective treatment for certain illnesses\nand is being studied and used to treat AIDS, cancer and Lyme Disease,\na serious and debilitating tick-borne illness in the United States.\nGurney\u2019s behavior\nIn the Gurney Journal article it was noted\nthat a 1951 description of syphilis \"bears an uncanny resemblance\nto our image of Gurney in the asylum years: the outbursts of temper,\nthe uncharacteristic obscene speech, the steady decline of creative\npower and the delusion that it was he who was the author of Shakespeare\u2019s\nplays...and the composer of much of the music of Beethoven, Brahms...\".\nIt is also noted that \"one result of syphilis in the nervous system,\nTabes Dorsalis (wasting of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord),\nsubjects the sufferer to sensations of lightning pains akin to electric\nshocks\" and that \"Throughout the period of his mental illness\nGurney was convinced that he was a victim of \u2018electrical torture\u2019.\"\nFirst, what proof do we have that \"outbursts\nof temper\" and \"uncharacteristic obscene speech\" were\nnot in fact characteristic of Gurney throughout his life? Gurney had\na terrible temper from childhood onward but over the years his friends\nattempted to soften this aspect of his behavior by making light of it.\nComposer Herbert Howells does this in his descriptions of Gurney\u2019s relationship\nwith their teacher Charles Stanford. Marion Scott, who knew all too\nwell how violent Gurney\u2019s temper could be, makes only veiled references\nto it in an effort to diminish its severity. She knew, for example,\nthat Gurney could be physically violent when in a temper and once cited\nan account of Gurney attacking another boy, knocking him down and breaking\nhis spectacles because he \"was annoyed by some things\" the\nother boy had said. Scott acknowledged that Gurney\u2019s \"own anger\nwas lightning when it came.\" Gurney enjoyed raunchy humour and\nobscenities and admitted it even to Scott. During the war he wrote to\nScott telling her that he had created an \"obstetric Journal\"\nthat greatly amused his fellow soldiers. He acknowledged that he had\nalways been a crude person, and \"these things come naturally to\nme. Music and lewd nonsense and using words\". Another note to Howells\nreveals that Gurney could be quite vulgar when writing about the bowel\nfunctions. Gurney also had an obsession with enemas.\nSecond, the issue of Gurney\u2019s hallucinations and\ndelusional behavior is very complex and I do not believe that there\nis a single answer to explain the form his hallucinations took. In the\nasylum, Gurney told doctors that he could \"see that all his life\nhe [was] subjected to Electricity\". When dealing with mental illness\nit is important to remember that quite often symptoms and behaviors\noverlap, a factor that can create confusion when trying to understand\nthe root cause of an illness.\nFor many years, it was believed that delusional\nbehavior was connected with schizophrenia and the so-called split from\nreality. Thus, Gurney was incorrectly labeled \"schizophrenic\".\nHowever, modern psychiatry has found that such behavior is also symptomatic\nof manic-depressive illness, an illness that had begun to show signs\nin Gurney in his late teens, possible even earlier. The nature and effects\nof this complex illness, which was severe in Gurney\u2019s case and never\ntreated, provide a more realistic explanation of Gurney\u2019s behavior prior\nto entering the asylum and his condition as the illness progressed during\nthe 15 years of his incarceration there.\nThe mystery of hallucinations\nAccording to the American psychologist, Dr. Kay\nRedfield Jamison, \"Depression affects not only mood but the nature\nand content of thought as well\". Manic states create degrees of\nmental responses that include these words to describe them: \"ebullient\",\n\"self-confident\", \"fluctuating\", \"volatile\",\n\"euphoric\" \"visionary expansiveness\", a \"mystical\nmerging of identities\", \"flighty thought\", \"leap\nfrom topic to topic\", \"leapfrogging nature of thought\",\n\"florid psychosis\" and so on. People in these states are often\n\"tortured\" and \"tormented\" by unseen forces of all\nkinds. Some synapse in the brain misfires, perhaps mimicking an electrical\nsensation, or the body undergoes a shift in its chemistry and the hallucinations\ncan take any form.\nAnother factor to consider is the period of time\nit takes for the hallucinatory stages of syphilis to manifest after\nit is contracted. The involvement of the central nervous system and\nthe brain occurs in the later stages of the disease, which can take\nup to 20 to 30 years to appear. It doesn\u2019t appear likely that the mental\nsymptoms of syphilis would have appeared with such force in Gurney after\nonly five or six years following possible infection. Gurney was already\nsuffering from hallucinations in 1918 and we know that such episodes\nare symptomatic of manic-depressive illness as it progresses through\nits complex manifestations.\nStudies of the lives of other poets and composers\nsuffering from manic-depressive illness reveal hallucinations and delusional\nbehavior similar to what Gurney suffered. There are even occasional\nreferences to terms with \"electrical\" connections used by\nthese suffers to describe their behavior or their perceptions of the\nworld around them. Virginia Woolf spoke of being \"a sensitive plant\nexposed to invisible rays...\" while the Russian poet Vladmir Mayakovsky\ndescribed himself as being the recipient of \"lightning telegrams\".\nThe American poet Robert Lowell believed that he was the Holy Ghost\nwhile another American poet, Theodore Roethke once felt himself to be\na lion. Roethke walked into a diner and demanded a raw steak and then,\nto the horror of other diners, he began to eat it. There is no known\nevidence that any of these individuals had syphilis.\nEach of these poets and writers suffered from hallucinations\nand delusional behavior associated with their manic-depressive illnesses.\nYou can read through history and find similar examples of hallucinations\nand delusions in Van Gogh, Schumann, Byron, Shelley, Plath, Coleridge,\nPoe, Melville, Berlioz, etc. and in them see little rhyme or reason\nor sense. Thoughts of suicide or attempts to commit suicide also figure\nin the behavioral patterns of some manic depressives.\nThere are as many examples of hallucinations and\ndelusions are as there are people suffering from them. All sorts of\nthreads run through them from violence to euphoria to pleas to die.\nWhen the mind is \"touched with fire\" it is very difficult\nto find the source of the flame and that might well be the case with\nGurney and the nature of his hallucinations.\nThird, if Gurney had syphilis, the malarial treatment\nshould have provided some relief from his mental symptoms. It did not.\nAfter the treatments ended the doctors reported that Gurney was improving\nphysically but \"there is little or no change in his delusions\".\nThe research and experimentation done by Dr. Julius Wagner-Jauregg in\nthe early years of the 20th century revealed that malarial\ntreatment of syphilis had \"striking\" results in curing patients.\nIn fact, these early medical pioneers claimed a cure rate of up to 85\npercent of late-stage victims who were treated promptly.\nMalarial treatment and shell shock\nDavid Goodland and I went off in two different\ndirections on the syphilis question. I consulted with a biologist who\nis an authority on malaria. He told me that as far as he knew, the only\nuse for malaria was to treat syphilis.\n\"My guess is that they (the doctors) thought,\nrightly or wrongly, that Gurney was suffering from syphilis and that\nthis was contributing to his mental problems,\" he said. Other medical\npeople I later spoke with confirmed this and I thought \"Here\u2019s\na possible explanation for some of Gurney\u2019s trouble\" although I\nwasn\u2019t convinced at that point in March 1999.\nIn the meantime, David uncovered vitally important\ninformation that doctors and authorities on malaria and sexually transmitted\ndiseases do not seem to be aware of. During the World War I era, malarial\ntherapy was an experimental treatment used on soldiers believed to be\nsuffering from shell shock or other mental\/emotional effects of the\nwar. Doctors thought that the malaria, which produced hallucinations\nand very high, dangerously high, fevers mentally \"cleansed\"\nthese men. Thus, malaria was NOT used exclusively to treat syphilis\nand, after World War I, it was indeed used \"speculatively\"\nin the hope of curing the mental anguish suffered by soldiers who had\nserved on the battlefield.\nWhen Gurney was admitted to the City of London\nMental Hospital in 1922, his doctors were clearly puzzled by his behavior.\nPartly because Gurney became so uncooperative and partly because they\nsimply did not have the knowledge or diagnostic skills, they were forced\nto do a lot of guess work in their efforts to find reasons for Gurney\u2019s\nmental condition. Without any concrete medical evidence to support them,\nthey assumed that he had suffered from shell shock during the war. It\nis important to remember that sometimes \"shell shock\" was\na catch-all name for ailments physicians could not otherwise define\nor whose root cause was not known to them. Thus, it is likely that as\nGurney\u2019s mental health deteriorated, the doctors, assumed that his condition\nmight be the result of shell shock that was noted on his admission papers.\nSince malaria was being used experimentally to treat soldiers suffering\nfrom shell shock, Gurney\u2019s doctors could very likely have believed that\nsuch a treatment would enable them to control or even cure his escalating\nmental symptoms.\nHowever, the fact that the malaria treatment failed\nto improve or change Gurney\u2019s hallucinations and delusional episodes\nand behavior should be considered as evidence that he did not suffer\nfrom syphilis. \"The malaria has had no beneficial effect mentally,\"\nstates an entry in the medical records dated 5 November 1923. If Gurney\nwas infected with neurosyphilis, the malaria fevers should have destroyed\nthe invading bacteria that cause the illness.\nFootnotes\n1.

Considered to be one of the greatest examples of railroad engineering on the Eastern Seaboard , the Bergen Arches had been forgotten for decades after being abandoned as a result of nationwide post- war railroad bankruptcies . The Bergen Arches are now encapsulated over time in a canopied forest of urban vegetation and wildlife . The surge of passenger traffic at the turn of the 20th century on the renowned Erie Railroad demanded that the line 's old Bergen Tunnel ( constructed 1856 - 1861 ) be abandoned for a new cleaner , multi-track system . The double - track Bergen Tunnel was notorious for poor ventilation due to enormous steam locomotives ; for gruesome accidents ; and for annoying , money-losing gridlock . It soon became clear that the Erie 's entire financial future rested on its ability to physically expand , just as the nearby Pennsylvania Railroad and Central Railroad of New Jersey had done years earlier with their open cuts . Competition between the railroad companies was very keen . The Erie , regarded as one of the most reliable and comfortable passenger lines in the country , had to expand in order to retain its envied prestige and reputation . Improvements in Jersey City would , therefore , define its future . | Bergen Arches \/ Erie Cut Postcard Courtesy of the Yost Collection | ... contractors are installing a comparatively new system for hoisting and conveying [ which ] has been used on the rapid transit subway construction in New York City , at the Devonport , England dock yards , and in the erection of the bridge over the Zambesi River at the Victoria Falls in South Africa The plant to be installed for the Bergen Hill excavation , however , is larger by far than any other ever made and involves some important features of novelty . | Bergen Arches \/ Erie Cut Postcard Courtesy of the Yost Collection | Using 250,000 pounds of dynamite to shape the mile - long cut and arches , workers blasted through 800,000 cubic yards of blue trap rock . 160,000 cubic yards of earth were excavated . Four short tunnels with widespread arched portals were blasted and chiseled out of the original Palisadian bluffs and faced with concrete made from the pulverized trap rock . The arched tunnels acted as natural bridges for the cobbled city streets that intersected high above the railbeds . Situated between these tunnels were soaring cuts that were \" open to the blue sky of heaven , \" as described in Men of Erie , thereby eliminating the coal smoke nuisance created by the old Bergen Tunnel . The open cuts were given a width of 60 feet at the base and 100 feet at the top . At certain points the depth of the vertical cliffs reaches 85 feet . The top edges of the cliffs were emblazoned with thick grass , draping flower beds and ornamental iron fencing , and adjacent city streets that looked down at the cut were beautifully landscaped at the expense of the Erie . The creation of this engineering marvel did not come without financial and human sacrifice . The project 's stupendous cost of five million dollars effectively curtailed the Erie 's plans to build a new monumental train and ferry terminal at the Jersey City waterfront . Scores of laborers lost their lives or were permanently maimed in the deep cut by roaring rock avalanches and accidental blasts , thereby crowding the City Hospital and morgue at taxpayer cost . Nearby residents suffered physical harm as well : boulders uplifted by dynamite whirled through the sky like stone seagulls and crashed through gabled roofs or landed in vined gardens . The Millard Construction Company , although revolutionary in construction techniques , practiced poor safety precautions . Lawsuits ensued . | Iron Erie Trestle ( far right ) Emerging from Erie Cut Courtesy of Jersey City Public Library | The Bergen Arches were opened to the public on June 13th , 1910 , nearly four years after construction began . Residents , elected officials and dignitaries watched as luxury passenger locomotives emerged from the cut 's expansive eastern portal atop the towering cliffs of the Palisades and spanned a colossal steel trestle that slowly dipped to grade level at the Jersey City waterfront several blocks down where the old Erie Terminal stood . The Jersey Journal reported the event in an extended story featured on its front page : After three years and eight months of unremitting work , which includes the customary delays that beset great engineering undertakings , the Erie Railroad Company has so far completed the task of constructing an open cut through Jersey City Heights the gigantic engineering feat is one of the greatest in the history of the Erie Railroad and of great importance , as it will afford the relief that has been needed for years as a result of the rapidly growing passenger traffic that has developed and continues to develop within fifty miles of New Yorkto the entire passenger service it means no more tunnel delays , no more closed windows , stifling atmosphere or artificial light , but a clean , wholesome ride for everybody and the elimination of the only passenger tunnel on the Erie Railroad between New York and Chicago . | Bergen Arches \/ Erie Cut Aerial Photo Copyright \u00a9 2000 Leon Yost | The Bergen Arches , a monumental engineering corridor that has contributed to Jersey City 's and New Jersey 's former prominence as a central railroad terminus , is the metropolitan area 's last remaining large railroad cut in its original form and splendor . The sheer sight of its astounding engineering elements conjures up an era of growth and prominence as dictated by the mighty Erie Railroad . Its battered folding cliffs and arcing concrete portals exist as reminders of brilliant engineers and laborers .

Adam Sweeting listens to contenders old and new This is allegedly the season to be merry , but for the more dogmatic species of music fan , it 's time to break out the duelling pistols and do battle over who made the greatest Christmas album of all time . Phil Spector 's A Christmas Gift for You ( Universal ) remains a perennial favourite , though perhaps the fact that it was originally released in November 1963 , the same month as John Kennedy 's assassination , has lent it a fateful aura denied to the competition . The Beach Boys ' 1964 Christmas Album ( Music For Pleasure ) still has its supporters , even though the disc could never make its mind up whether it was a bona fide Beach Boys album or a dollop of Christmas schlock . Some arch - traditionalists will go to their graves clutching their dog-eared copies of Elvis 's Christmas Album ( Camden ) from 1957 , convinced that it 's the apogee of Yuletide artistry . But it 's a rare recording that manages to crawl from the wreckage of Christmases past and establish itself as a credible musical artefact , and you could plug the Channel Tunnel with seasonal discs down the ages and still find yourself looking for somewhere to dump The Star Wars Christmas Album ( Rhino ) or A Christmas Together by John Denver and the Muppets ( Delta ) . None the less , despite its connotations of brainless sentimentality and crude commercialism , the Christmas album continues to exert an inexplicable allure for every kind of artist . Perhaps it 's all bound up with rheumy - eyed reveries of childhood and Bing Crosby singing White Christmas on the telly , but rockers , crooners , choristers , country singers , jazzers and even rappers have found themselves overcome by the seasonal urge . Even as the music biz thrashes around searching for scapegoats for its self - inflicted crises , this year 's crop has flung up a few pleasant surprises among the regular tonnage of compilations and reissues . For instance , Brian Wilson continues his gravity - defying rehabilitation by picking up some 40 - year - old Beach Boy threads on What I Really Want for Christmas ( BMG ) , mixing reworked antiques such as Silent Night and Hark ! The Herald Angels Sing alongside a couple of new songs . Wilson does n't shimmer with the same radiance that surrounded him in the Pet Sounds era , but he sounds several megawatts sparkier than the brain - damaged burn - out he resembled a few years ago . I have never had much time for the imperial pretensions of soul diva Anita Baker , but experts claim she 's a reformed character after taking a 10 - year sabbatical to deal with \" life issues \" . Empowerment slogans aside , her album Christmas Fantasy ( Blue Note ) is refreshingly free of her previous glossy hauteur , letting a warm earthiness seep up through tracks such as Oh Come , All Ye Faithful or the newly written Moonlight Sleighride . Best of the lot is Frosty 's Rag , where Baker takes Frosty the Snowman for a jog round New Orleans . Likewise , Diana Krall seems energised by the season of over-eating and paper hats . While the dozen songs on her album Christmas Songs ( Verve ) include some of the most-recorded Christmas tunes in history , Krall and her co-conspirators have managed to bring something fresh to most of them . Often she 's accompanied by the massed brass and woodwinds of the Clayton \/ Hamilton Jazz Orchestra , who lend zip and bounce to Let It Snow , while elsewhere she 's moody and pensive ( Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas ) . But mostly , the album works because Krall 's cracked and smoky vocals make the perfect antidote to Yuletide treacle . Advertisers like plugging the notion that Christmas is a time for families , and the McGarrigle sisters , Kate and Anna , have taken them at their word with The McGarrigle Christmas Hour ( Nonesuch ) . These days Kate is probably best known for being the mother of Martha Wainwright and her brother Rufus , who both appear here alongside Anna 's daughter Lily Lanken and sundry guests . These include Emmylou Harris , who sings O Little Town of Bethlehem as if shaking the last drops from a bottle of Courvoisier . Sometimes the gather - round - the- log - fire approach lurches into tweeness , but Rufus 's What are You Doing New Year 's Eve ? and Martha and Lily 's version of Jackson Browne 's Rebel Jesus are superb . Will these newcomers be able to hold their own in the retailing battles of Christmas future ? As a reminder of the scores they have to beat , Sony has reissued Mariah Carey 's 1994 album Merry Christmas in a souped - up Dual Disc edition with extra tracks and videos . It originally sold 15 million copies worldwide , which is curious , since listening to Mariah is like having your wisdom teeth pulled by General Pinochet 's secret police . Much nicer is Nat & Dean at Christmas ( EMI ) , a two-disc collection of Christmas songs from Nat King Cole and Dean Martin that is like toasting your toes by the fire ( though the title is misleading , since these are all solo tracks rather than duets ) . And finally , the reissue of the Christmas Album ( High Coin ) by Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass is a dizzying reminder of changing tastes . Herb 's frothy mock-mariachi band sounds faintly ridiculous at this distance , but the album was an American chart -topper in 1968 , 1969 and 1970 ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Miles Edgeworth can apparently hold his own , now that Phoenix Wright has stepped out of the spotlight . Gyakuten Kenji 2 once again stars the pompous prosecutor as he stumbles upon what we believe to be another murder case . At the 2010 Tokyo Game Show , Capcom set aside an entire area dedicated to Edgey , where we were able to sit down and try to decipher what was going on through still images , motions , and facial expressions . Because it 's an adventure game that is text - heavy and story -driven , not being able to read Japanese made it a bit difficult to figure out what was going on . However , the sequel looks to follow the same formula , so we were still able to get far enough to see some of the new gameplay features . Like in the previous game , you can control Miles and move around in a third - person view when examining a crime scene . It 'll switch to a first - person view when you stumble across something of significance and have to examine more closely . All we know about the first case is that someone important gets shot after arriving on a plane . The snooty Miles and the lovable and bumbling detective sidekick , Gumshoe , arrive on the scene to try to piece together the truth . Like with any point- and - click adventure , you click around to find information and evidence , which gets tucked away in your inventory . The logic function returns , where you must link the pertinent information together in order to proceed with the investigation . In our first case , we took a closer look at an area where a large flag and a bright white statue with a red gem on it had been knocked over . Here we were asked to point out a contradiction in the scene , and any mistake will take a notch off the penalty bar . Up until now , everything felt familiar , and through some careful observations , we were able to get by . The tricky part came when we approached this feisty girl with a backpack , and suddenly the background changed and two chess pieces appeared onscreen for each character . From what we could tell , this seemed to be some form of interrogation , and depending on how you answer , you use one of your chess pieces to destroy your opponents . A bar at the bottom screen indicates a clicking timer , so not only did we have to make the right choice , but we had to make it quickly . Through much trial and error , we were able to figure out what to say and then use our pawn and horse pieces wisely to take out the girl 's rook . Your pieces also change as you go through the dialogue tree , and we can only guess what was actually taking place . One wrong answer , and you 'll get dinged , and this time your penalty bar is also ticking down . However , it 's not game over if you run out ; you 'll just have to go through the entire process again . We had to stop once we got to where we had to point out contradictions in the girl 's testimony . But the game is set up just like the last one , where you must press for more information and find the contradiction in her statements using evidence . It 's good to see that the ruffle - wearing lawyer is back , but it looks like we 're going to have to wait awhile to see what he has to say in English .

There was a certain point in the project when things just were n't coming together fast enough , and we needed more time to make the changes suggested by our focus groups . We went to D3 and asked ( very nicely ) for them to give us more time to get the game right ! It was a new intellectual property , one that we wanted to be successful and one that we eventually wanted to turn into a brand with future games . The choice was to ship it with problems and get poor reviews , or to take the time to make the necessary changes and hopefully get great reviews . The experience that most teams have had in this industry is , \u201c release the game and take your lumps . \u201d Luckily for us , D3 had the foresight to give us the extra time we needed . We actually had time to fix some of the problems and make the game we really wanted to make ! After an additional six or so months , we were able to re-unveil the game -- and , at its second E3 showing , Dead Head Fred received a nomination for Best Handheld Game from the Game Critics Awards : Best of E3 2007 . This acknowledgement from our peers was huge , especially considering the tough competition -- not to mention the fact that Fred was the only new intellectual property in the bunch . 5 . Utilizing our technology , the Vicious Engine . We actively license our game development technology -- the Vicious Engine -- to the games industry . Over the past five years we 've developed all of our internal products across multiple platforms using the engine . Dead Head Fred allowed us to utilize our technology to make another great game , and it provided us the perfect opportunity to update the technology and further enhance our support for the PSP platform . The Vicious Engine has turned into a stable environment for making games on current and next- gen consoles , the PSP and the PC . Given its highly data driven architecture , we were able to devote many more team members on the game content development while the engineers continued expanding engine support for the PSP . All game features in Dead Head Fred were implemented through the interface of the Vicious Editor , requiring no game - specific C ++ code . Most of the game - level features required for Fred were already in place , but significant updates had to be made to the low level platform code . We were able to quickly modify the base engine to work well on the PSP . While the PSP is similar to the PS2 , it has less memory and is able to handle fewer visuals . However , with time and effort we were able to generate a truly robust and fully optimized implementation of the Vicious Engine on this portable console ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Some ran . Some stood and fought . But no -one forgot their first meeting with a tank . A weapon without precedent , which went on to dominate the battlefields of the 20th Century . And it was designed by two men , in little more than two months , working out of a small hotel room in Lincoln . Science fiction \" By 1915 , the British army knew it had an immense problem , \" said David Willey , curator at the Bovington Tank Museum . \" Instead of a war of movement , the battlefield had become one of defensive trenches protected by thickets of barbed wire and machine guns . \" So how to get through that ? How do you break in to the German trenches ? \" To their credit , senior officers recognised technology might offer an answer . This brought a lot of crackpot ideas out of the woodwork but also some with more potential . \" Armoured cars had been around for years , but with standard road wheels they were almost as helpless as cavalry when faced with ditches and dugouts . Vast ironclad war machines were the stuff of science fiction . It needed a harder head to find a solution . Winston Churchill , then First Lord of the Admiralty , had listened to the swirl of bold ideas and nagged cabinet colleagues for action . In February 1915 , the Admiralty Landships Committee began to examine ideas . But where to test them out ? The choice seems , at first , rather odd . William Foster and Co Ltd , in Lincoln , specialised in threshing machines . But historian Richard Pullen explains the logic . \" Foster 's had worked with powerful - and tracked - machines for farms , \" he says . \" This translated into making tractors to tow big artillery guns in the early days of the war . \" So , the army knew they had experience , knew they could deliver and Lincoln was a nice , quiet spot away from prying eyes . \" The work needed more than technical experience , it needed two very particular men - William Tritton and Lieutenant Walter Wilson . \" Tritton was a brilliant engineer , \" says Mr Pullen . \" And he was a brilliant leader . He got things done . \" He turned Foster 's around with new ideas and new markets . \" Couple him with Walter Wilson , who was also a good engineer but a genius with things like gearboxes , and they made a brilliant partnership . \" On 22 July 1915 , a commission was placed to design a machine that could cross a trench 4 ft ( 1.2 m ) wide . To get away from the noise and distraction of Foster 's factory , a suite was taken at the White Hart Hotel , in Lincoln . \" They locked themselves in the room and would scribble designs on envelopes and cigarette packets , \" says Mr Pullen . \" Anything they liked went to the factory for testing , anything they did n't went on the fire . \" They knew they had to work fast . \" Everyone was worried the Germans would come up with a similar machine first , \" he explains . \" It could change the course of the war . \" It was also viewed as a way to save the lives of men on the front by breaking the deadlock . Every day longer it took meant more British soldiers died . \" A first design , little more than an armoured box on US tractor tracks , known as Little Willie , was tested on 19 September . It failed . Picnic panic A 5 ft ( 1.5 m ) bank could not be overcome and as it crossed a trench , the tracks sagged from their rollers and came off . Officials from London , who only dared whisper about the project , were dumbfounded to find workers had invited their families , complete with picnics , to the tests . \" When challenged , \" said Mr Pullen , \" Tritton growled that to treat the whole thing as a big secret would attract more attention . \" Tritton had spotted the problem early and new tracks were being designed from scratch . Bigger , tougher and built to cling to their frames . Fitted with the new system , Little Willie could cross the 4ft gap . But , the challenge had changed . The army now faced trenches 8 ft ( 2.4 m ) wide . However , Wilson had also been looking ahead and had the answer ready . Instead of being tucked at the bottom of the machine , the tracks would go all the way round its 25 ft 5 in ( 7.75 m ) length . They would also be carried on forward - sloping \" prows \" projecting beyond the crew compartment , giving it a huge reach . The famous \" wonky box \" lozenge shape was born . Variously known as Centipede , Mother and Big Willie , it would weigh 28 tonnes . \" It was a design ahead of its time , \" said Mr Pullen . \" It pushed technology to the limit and beyond . \" The engine they had to use was not really powerful enough - steering , command and tactics were in their infancy . But , the need was desperate \" Make or break In line with the break - neck speed of the project , the design was approved at the end of September , a prototype was ready in December . After encouraging tests in Lincoln , the machine was taken to Hatfield in Hertfordshire , to be run across a mock battlefield for an audience of senior politicians and soldiers . The newly codenamed Tank ( a deliberately vague term inspired by its boxy shape ) bellowed into life and crashed over ditches , crossed a bog and crushed wire barriers . Its creators waited for the official verdict . One officer called it a \" slug \" and pronounced it too heavy for French bridges . Lord Kitchener , the Minister of War , felt it was \" a toy \" and \" without serious military value \" . General Butler , representing Commander in Chief Douglas Haig and the most important opinion in the audience , leant over to a colleague and said : \" How soon can we have them ? \" Mr Willey said : \" The direct military impact of the tank can be debated but its effect on the Germans was immense , it caused bewilderment , terror and concern in equal measure . \" It was also a huge boost to the civilians at home . After facing the Zeppelins , at last Britain had a wonder weapon .

Direct X 12 is faster , lighter - weight , and more predictable , said Anuj Gosalia , Development Manager for Graphics at Microsoft , at the Game Developers Conference on Thursday , calling the new tech \u201c the beginning of a new era in graphics APIs . \u201d Gosalia started his talk with some truisms that influenced the design of Direct X 12 : GPU performance will continue to increase aggressively , while CPU core count is unlikely to aggressively increase . So what did developers want from DirectX and Microsoft ? It was manifold : a console - like \u201c closer to the metal \u201d API , more control , an elimination of overhead , predictability , consistency , advanced rendering techniques , better debugging tools , and broad availability . A tall order . Meet Direct X 12 \u201c The engineers at Microsoft and the GPU manufacturers have been looking at this for a long time , and we came up with Direct X 12 , \u201d said Gosalia . Direct X 12 , and in particular Direct3D 12 , went down the list and checked everything off : Direct X 12 is faster , allows more complexity , works on all Microsoft platforms ( consoles , computers , tablets ) , and has better support tools . After all , as Gosalia said , \u201c Our API is only as good as the tools you have to use it . \u201d If you 're a lay- person , feel free to skip this paragraph full of tech jargon ( taken from Gosalia 's slides ) : With Direct X12 , you 're looking at reduced overhead for state changes ; Efficient reuse of rendering commands . Multithreaded scalability . Flexibile and efficient resource blinding model ; App-controlled graphics memory heaps ; Amortizing create \/ destroy costs ; Ultra-low cost re-allocates ; Free threaded resource and heap management ; Access to swizzled resources ; Compressed resources ( Jpeg , ASTC - LDR ) in hardware ; The lower - level API also allows the app to track GPU pipeline status , control resource state transitions , and control resource renaming . Looks like nonsense to most of you , right ? Especially \u201c swizzled \u201d \u2014 surely that ca n't be a word . So what ? So what does DirectX 12 mean for you , the consumer ? Easy : It 's more efficient \u2014 and thus faster \u2014 than what came before , providing a leap ahead in graphics potential . Gosalia showed off Direct X 12 's power with a demonstration of the 3DMark benchmarking software . With Direct X 11 , the machine 's four cores were unbalanced \u2014 one core carried most of the load , while the other three sat mostly idle . With Direct X 12 running the same demo , all four cores carried a balanced amount of the workload , and the overall workload was reduced by half . For a real - world demo , Gosalia trotted out Chris Tector of Turn 10 Studios to show off Direct X 12 's capabilities with Forza 5 on a PC powered by an Nvidia Titan Black GPU . \u201c At Turn 10 , we 're strictly a console developer and we 're used to going as close to the metal as we can , \u201d said Tector . Turn 10 tried to port Forza 5 to Direct X 11 , but found massive CPU overhead created a lot of stuttering . The Direct X 12 demo we saw , on the other hand , ran at a smooth framerate primarily because many of its new features \u2014 such as bundling resources \u2014 were drawn directly from Microsoft 's Xbox One tools . \u201c We 're excited to see console - style development coming to the PC , \u201d said Tector . Hardware makers get hot and bothered And he was n't the only one excited . After Tector , a parade of industry figures came out to talk about their relation with Microsoft and DirectX 12 . AMD 's Raja Koduri said Direct X 12 was like \u201c getting four generations of hardware ahead , \u201d all at once . Intel 's Vice President of Platform Engineering Eric Mentzer shared a similar sentiment , with , \u201c This is absolutely , I think , the most significant jump in technology in a long , long time . \u201d Nvidia 's Senior Vice President of Content and Technology , Tony Tamashi , took some shots at AMD 's similar Mantle initiative , saying they 're excited about DirectX 12 because it supports existing goals \u201c within the framework of existing graphics APIs , \u201d without the need to fragment the community . Even Qualcomm got in on the game , touting the fact that DirectX 12 sees both improved power efficiency and performance on mobile hardware . When can you get it ? Not for a while . Microsoft is targeting Direct X 12 's release alongside holiday 2015 games , though they 're planning a preview for later this year . Gosalia also hinted at an early access program , though he was cagey about details . Continuing DirectX 's legacy and purpose , most recent hardware will be supported \u2014 for instance , Intel 's fourth generation Core processors and all Nvidia hardware from Fermi architecture onwards . Microsoft estimates that approximately 50 percent of existing PC game enthusiasts will have the necessary hardware to run DirectX 12 at launch , and of course the technology will be coming to the Xbox One . However , Microsoft did not commit to Windows 7 support . In fact , with a launch date of 2015 , there 's a good chance Microsoft is targeting DirectX 12 for the rumored release of \u201c Windows 9 , \u201d whatever that ends up being . Regardless , it seems like a huge step forward for games technology . I look forward to getting my hands on it sometime later this year .

How has the community reacted to the killing ? | | Flowers have been laid where Jessie was shot One day after the shooting , police have opened up the park where Jessie died . Groups of youths stand in the precise spot where Jessie 's body was found and some teenagers have lit candles . It seems to be a kind of vigil , but outsiders are not invited . This neighbourhood feels wounded both by the violence and the negative publicity which follows . The attack , with a semi-automatic pistol , was the latest in a string of shootings . Some locals seem resigned to it . A young woman who lives close to the park said : \" This year there 's been four shootings and I 'm not even scared anymore because I 'm used to it . It 's not even horrible anymore - it 's just normal . \" Gang culture Manchester may have as many as 500 gang members . There is a concentration in a strip just south of the city centre stretching from Hulme to Longsight , passing through Moss Side - a poor area and the hub of the city 's black community . Manchester 's gang members are disproportionately from ethnic minorities , although most are British born . Analysts say the city 's modern gang culture began in the 1970s in deprived areas where it was often hard to make money through legitimate means . Some turned to drug dealing , mainly in cannabis . People on the street say it is still a centre for dealing - although today 's drugs are harder . About 100 yards from the park , a group of Asian youths has gathered . One of them said : \" Moss Side is seen as , like , a place for drugs - so gang members usually hang around there and if you get involved with them these things are bound to happen . \" I think life would be fine if you stay away from them groups . \" That view is partly right - the gangs do mainly shoot at each other , but innocent blood is spilled . Police say there is no evidence Jessie James was a gang member - he was in the wrong place at the wrong time . Patsy McKie 's son Dorrie was shot dead at the age of 20 . Six years on she is still full of questions , not least who did it as nobody has been put behind bars . \" Another young man is dead , another mother is going to be suffering , \" she said . \" Lack of this , lack of that , but it 's the same everywhere - there are lots of people everywhere that 's got deprivation but they ai n't doing it . \" Bravado and loyalty There are no easy answers but some clues are writ large in Moss Side - literally . | | It is thought that Jessie was mistaken for a gang member A terraced street only a couple of minutes walk from where Jessie was shot has graffiti in bold silver showing a sort of gangster figure . Next to the drawing is written : RIP To All the Fallen Soldiers Sadly Missed . It speaks of bravado , loyalty and a perverse sense of heroic sacrifice . Nearby teenagers say that some may find that message appealing . A black teenager chatting to her friends in the street said : \" They look up to all these older ones in the big cars selling drugs - that 's all it is really . \" Moss Side deserves a reputation actually because there 's always gunshots , there 's always murders , there 's always violence . \" Senior police express confidence about finding Jessie James 's killer , but getting people to give evidence in court would be a major challenge . A Home Office study of south Manchester revealed that in 150 separate shooting incidents over a three - year period , only one witness came forward to testify ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

It might be foreign . Any information you can provide will be appreciated . The cartoon many know as SNOWMAN IN JULY was originally called THE SNOWMAN ( or \" Der Schneemann \" ) , which was produced in Nazi Germany in 1943 by Hans Fischerkoesen . Fischerkosen ( 1896 - 1973 ) was a great German cartoonist \/ producer who produced short color theatrical cartoons during the wartime era . Some of them were acquired , along with many other Europeon cartoons , for U.S. TV distribution in the 1950s in cartoon packages with names like CAPTAIN SAILORBIRD and BOZO'S STORYBOOK . I am sure there are many WB cartoon fans out there ask themselves the same three questions . Could your page be so kind as to become the first in history to unmask the mystery ? Here 's a \" Lost Warner Bros . Cartoon \" that should remain lost , forever ! The Looney Tunes characters involved here were Daffy , Porky , Elmer , Yosemite Sam , Tweety , Petunia Pig ( voice by Jane Webb ) , Wile E. Coyote , Foghorn Leghorn , Pepe LePew , and Sylvester . Mel Blanc provides the Warner character voices and he sounds pretty good here , with the exception of an awful baritone Elmer Fudd , and Daffy & Tweety who are sped up way too much , sounding like they are on helium ! The Looney Tunes are drawn reasonably well with the exception of Pepe and Wile E. who look particularly terrible . PLOT SYNOPSIS : The Groovie Goolies are at home watching a TV interview of Petunia Pig interviewing Daffy Duck about his latest movie \" King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table \" . A clip is shown : Foghorn is King Arthur , Sylvester is his loyal jester . Foggy asks Sylvester to take his new son ( an egg ) for a walk . While walking , Sylvester decides to eat the egg . Tweety tries to stop him , but the egg hatches . Daffy ( as Arthur in a baby bonnet ) emerges . The Phantom stops the screening and grabs the film . The Goolies & Looneys chase after him and corner him on a pirate ship set . The Phantom get 's away and disguises as a little boy , hiding the film in his guitar . He runs into \" Mad Mirror Land \" and he and three of the Goolies become live action ( !! ) . This is the best part of the picture , as the Goolies chase the kid using pixilation techniques . They chase into a western town set , then get distracted and begin to play music . Frankie grabs the guitar and his gigantic sneezes force the whole group through the mirror and back into cartoon land . The Phantom is revealed to be Claude Chaney , Drac 's long lost uncle , a formerly famous actor who wanted revenge for movies going to color ( ?? ) . Daffy gives Chaney a job , \" King Arthur \" wins an Ozzie Award , and the Goolies go home . The last scenes has some of the Looney Tunes , led by Sam , following the Goolie gang home to their castle . SIMON asks : Some sources list Clampett 's \" It 's A Grand Old Nag \" ( 1947 ) as the only cartoon released by Republic , but I 've also seen references to a series of travelogue spoofs called \" Jerky Journies \" that were apparently released in ' 49 by Republic . Do you know anything about these cartoons ? Were they really released ? Are they all lost now ? Do you know who worked on them ? The JERKY JOURNEYS were indeed released . There were only four . Republic was a low budget studio and I suspect that they were interested in promoting their \" TruColor \" process . Cartoons were a great way of doing that . Bob Clampett 's \" Charlie Horse \" cartoon ( released 12\/1\/47 ) cost $ 20,000 . to produce . Republic got four JERKY JOURNEYS for a total of $ 46,787 . This was possible because there is almost no animation in these films ! BEYOND CIVILIZATION TO TEXAS ( 3\/15\/49 ) THE 3 MINNIES : SOTA , TONKA & HA HA ! ( 4\/15\/49 ) BUNGLE IN THE JUNGLE ( 5\/15\/49 ) ROMANTIC RUMBOLIA ( 6\/15\/49 ) Three cartoons starring \" Three Monkeys \" were released in 1940 by Monogram : A BUSY DAY , THE BEAUTY SHOPPE and BABY CHECKERS . I believe these were produced by Ub Iwerks , sponsored by Boots Chemists in England and picked up by B-studio Monogram for U.S. distribution . These films still exist in private collections . There is a VHS tape available from The Whole Toon Catalog called \" British and Australian Cartoons \" that contains A BUSY DAY and THE BEAUTY SHOPPE . MOE HARE asks : I would like to know if any of the \" Toby The Pup \" cartoons survived in any kind of form ? I know that Charles Mintz produced the series and was released by RKO \/ Radio pictures and would n't Turner own the rights to the films today ? Do you have any kind of images of Toby ? And will any of these cartoons make it to video someday . Scenes from HALLOWEEN , courtesy of reader \" Duckfilm \" Buzz Dixon asks : Back in the early 60s I saw a \" serial \" on a local morning kid show in Asheville , N.C. ( I say \" serial \" because they ran other cartoons \" serials \" that were originally features , such as THE ADVENTURES OF MR . WONDERBIRD and several Russian fairy tale featurettes ) . The name of the serial was THE SPACE ADVENTURERS or something like that ( in the mid-to - late 70s Universal 16 listed a film in their catalog that sounded very close to the cartoon I 'd seen ; that is the only published reference to it I 've ever seen ) . The plot involved a young boy stowing away on a spaceship that was taking off to rescue his missing father , who had disappeared on an earlier spaceflight . What made the story quite memorable , however , was that the rockets and spaceflight scenes were live action miniatures , not cartoon animation as the rest of the movie . In fact , the live action footage came from an abandoned Barvarian film called ROCKETSHIP ONE TAKES OFF ( or some simimlar variant title ) . Stills from ROCKETSHIP ONE can be found in several sources and a clip ( without cartoon animation interior shots ) ran on a Discovery channel special on spaceflight last year . My questions are ( a ) what is the origin of SPACE ADVENTURERS and ( b ) is it available on tape or disc anywhere ? The film is actually called THE SPACE EXPLORERS . It was put together in 1957 by a small New York company called Radio & Television Packagers , Inc. run by Fred Ladd ( who would bring Japan 's ASTRO BOY and GIGANTOR to America in the 1960s - see above ) . The film takes place in a futuristic \" 1978 \" where a young boy , Jimmy , stows away on a spaceship of Professor Nordheim and his female navigator , Smitty . They are en route to Mars , where Jimmy hopes to find his father , the first astronaut to land there , years earlier . According to ace cartoon researcher Ray Pointer , the plot goes like this : \" Jimmy 's father was \" Commander Perry , \" and the spaceship that he took to Mars was The Polaris ! ( You get the picture ? ) When Jimmy heard that the Polaris was lost , he stowed away in a shipping crate that was loaded onto the rescue ship , The Polaris II , was commanded by the Professor and Smitty , his female assistant . \" When Jimmy is revealed , the journey becomes a \" vehicle \" to teach astronomy . As it turned out , they stopped at the Moon , and it was there that Jimmy accidentally finds his father who has crash landed there , never landing on Mars . He did manage to bring back a several valuable photographs of the planet taken from outer space . \" According to Fred Ladd , he took a half - hour Eastern Europeon animated short film ( he could n't remember the original title ) , and made a two -hour movie of it by reruning and reusing the footage , and padding it with live action spaceship shots from a German film called Weltraumschiff 1 Startet and outer space and planet shots from a Europeon feature called UNIVERSE . Because the Sputnik craze was so hot , they rushed the first hour of THE SPACE EXPLORERS to television as soon as it was finished . They then released the second hour , a few months later , as THE NEW ADVENTURES OF THE SPACE EXPLORERS . In the 1960s , Ladd cut the film into 6 minute episodes for syndication ! According to Ray Pointer , \" The sequel , THE NEW ADVENTURES OF THE SPACE EXPLORERS reused material from the first with a new twist . The professor tricks Jimmy into going with him on a mission to Mars to retrieve a defective data gathering satellite . \" In this one , aspects of Einstein 's Theories are explained along with other interesting scientific information . Thinking back on it , I found that they cleverly integrated film footage with intelligent writing and made an entertaining educational series that keep this five year old excited about the prospects of interplanetary travel . \" There was a similar educational series like this called JOURNEY TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA . It was similar in concept to SPACE EXPLORERS , made up of Eastern European animation cut together with live action footage about undersea life . Again , well done , but I liked SPACE EXPLORERS better . There was also another serialized adventure , JOURNEY TO THE BEGINNING OF TIME , but this was entirely live action cut together with the same narrative technique used in the other two series . \" More SPACE EXPLORERS info Click Here . Anyone have a copy of SPACE EXPLORERES ( on tape or film ) ? Buzzy Boop , Betty 's michievous niece , appeared in two cartoons which are considered lost .

By mixing film and television technology , the husband - wife team of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson created adventure series like Supercar and Fireball XL - 5 that were enormously popular around the globe . There was always a big juvenile interest in \" boys with toys \" entertainment that had previously been tapped by Japanese monster and science fiction movies . Films like The Mysterians and TV series like the Andersons ' Thunderbirds were like watching one 's fantasy Dinky toys and plastic rocketships come to life , and the miniature settings were far better than any kid 's train set or hobby kit . The UK TV success of Thunderbirds disappointingly did not transfer to America , where it was syndicated instead of being picked up by a major network . United Artists nevertheless commissioned a pair of feature films based on the Tracy family 's fantastic stable of futuristic rescue vehicles . Simply by switching over to the then - popular Techniscope format , the Andersons were able to continue their tradition of expert microphotography in the anamorphic realm , and their amusing \" Supermarionation \" credit was transferred to the big screen . Thunderbirds Are Go enlarges the scope of the television show to a trip to Mars and provides a full workout for the flying tanks and rockets based on the Tracys ' tropical island . The entire Anderson empire was clearly a family affair and shows the strengths and weaknesses inherent in such companies . The craft and ingenuity put into the built- from-scratch visuals and effects is remarkable , and the work of effects whiz Derek Meddings is so good that many illusions are better than the standard in live action films of the time . 1 However , keeping all the creative functions to one 's self is n't always a good idea and the big-screen Thunderbirds scripts are almost purposely corny and trite , as if the key to Batman - like camp success were to just be mediocre and keep one 's chin up . Dialogue is sincere and flat and almost completely expository in nature , just there to explain the parade of gadgets . The lumpy story makes International Rescue an ancillary plot thread to a Mars Mission we do n't really care about , and as usual the only character allowed the least flexibility is the writer - producer 's own alter - ego , Lady Penelope . While the velvet - voiced femme superspy in the pink Rolls Royce has all the fun , the interchangeable Tracy brothers have little to do except sit , stand and ride amusing contraptions designed to relieve them of the need to walk . The exception is the youngest brother , who imagines a fantasy ( within a fantasy ) dream where \" Cliff Richard Jr. \" sings a groaner called Shooting Star in a space nightclub right out of The Jetsons . 2 Thunderbirds Are Go plays well with nostalgic adults today who hoot and holler like we did at kiddie shows in the 1950s . For all its shortcomings - no real story or emotional center - the film generates a good silly suspense , and the miniature world of constant jeopardy and exploding chaos is an oddly accurate view of modern life . It 's pushbutton luxury and Pi\u00f1a Coladas , until all hell breaks loose and everything is blown to smithereens . One wonders why everyone 's so ecstatic about the rescue of the Zero X crew , when the falling ship appears to strike a sizeable community , wiping out thousands of innocent people . And where 's the Dirtybirds spin-off show , the one charting the exploits of the lowly ordinary folk who clean up the devastion brought on by the Tracys ' \" rescues ? \" I guess International Rescue is located on a secret island to avoid lawsuits . Thunderbirds Are Go is given enthusiastic support by MGM 's lush special edition . The new enhanced transfer is crystal clear with good color and few scratches or other signs of age , and the orgy of rocket blasts and colorful explosions fills the room with the kind of blow - it - up pre-sexual overkill that little boys and many fathers love . The remixed 5.1 track is in Dolby and DTS and augments the effects with more discretion than is usual . Sylvia Anderson and David Lane provide a commentary that 's pleasant and informative , although hardcore Supermarionation fans wo n't learn anything new . The three featurettes present different aspects of the show with the same interview subjects , augmented by Mary Turner , an original ' puppet coordinator ' and Richard Holliss , a fan spokesman . There 's also a musical montage of stills , the original trailer and an activity called \" Who Said That ? \" Since I cannot place a lookalike Tracy face with a Tracy name , I 'm not going to do too well in that game . Thunderbird Six appears to have been made to fulfill the UA contract after the broadcast version had ceased production . The Andersons had already moved on to newer TV shows and their first live - action spectacle Doppelganger , aka Journey to the Far Side of the Sun. Released from the pressure to film Bigger and Better Explosions by the relative boxoffice failure of the first film , they go off on a completely new direction with a story that has equal appeal to lovers of dolls and miniature doll houses . The plot uncomfortably resembles the 9\/11 terror raids - a monstrous airship is seized by mysterious hijackers , here personified by a nefarious dark - skinned Eastern malefactor , the same one that gave the TV show a racist tone whenever ill-defined bad guys were needed . Stills ( that can be seen in the films extras ) show cut scenes of the Black Phantom in his lair , which resembles the temple of an Eastern cult . In a now - eerie scene , Sky Ship One cruises majestically past the Statue of Liberty . That not-particularly - PC Asian bad guy is mostly sidelined in favor of the smooth and personality - free anglo puppet characters that the Andersons made famous . 3 This time the screenplay concentrates on character more than action , but only Lady Penelope is able to take center stage . The need for an occasional change of facial expression shows the painful limitations of the marionette process . The puppets always looked slightly sinister to Savant , and when they \" change heads \" to show exaggerated laughing faces , the effect is disturbingly bizarre . Otherwise , the round - the - world cruise allows for some colorful , stereotyped peeks at foreign locales and famous sights , all recreated in cute miniatures perhaps saved from earlier TV episodes . Director Lane uses cutaways to avoid having to show scenes of puppets in motion , not an easy thing to do when one wants to dramatize a running gun battle on a runaway airship . The bad guys capture Penelope and her IR ( International Rescue , not Internal Revenue ) allies and tie them up , so as better to explain to them their evil aims . Naturally , the limitations of the technique require Lane to cut away until the heroes are all bound to the ship 's levitation apparatus , whereupon the bad guy Foster says \" You are now my prisoners ! \" in case there are some blind viewers in the audience . 4 Making the top secret new IR vehicle Thunderbird 6 a ( spoiler ! spoiler ! ) simple 1920s biplane provides an interesting change from the futuristic hardware , a distinction that Thunderbirds fans were n't likely to appreciate . Although there 's a battle in an African desert ( our trusty IR lads open fire with massive cannons on the pitifully - outgunned hostiles ) and another calamitous circus of explosions for a finish , a lot of Thunderbird 6 hangs around various castles and doll - house style dialogue scenes . Chances are the little girls did n't want to see Lady Penelope 's tea party any more than the boys did . The use of a biplane cues a lot of live action footage that looks just fine yet breaks the spell of the Andersons ' hermetically - sealed and hand crafted miniature world . One could envision later TV and computer technology enabling live action characters to be inserted into the clever miniature settings and vehicles , but modern movies have already leapfrogged that by skipping all the time - consuming real model work in favor of a computer generated universe - people , backgrounds and hardware . The Thunderbirds canon is still fun to contemplate because of the artisanship that went into it . Somewhere in England a little family of underpaid craftspeople created their own world of magic , and that 's the appeal . Thunderbird Six receives equal treatment in both transfer ( enhanced Techniscope ) and audio ( DTS and Dolby ) on its MGM DVD . The three featurettes on this one are different and concentrate on the Lady Penelope character and the film 's biplane . The game this time is called \" Craft Mission Match - Up . \" The two films are available separately but MGM has paired them in a gift set at no extra expense . The shiny new box looks like something a nifty 60s toy would come in , and there are punch - out ship activities and punch - out refrigerator magnets . Savant recommends having an adult remove the false back paper insert - it 's attached with a couple of dabs of rubber cement and a tot trying to pry it loose might rip the punch - out card . Careful when opening the package too , as the punch - out card is exposed on the outside . A final paper insert is a plug for a CD of Barry Gray 's cute music score , with its rousing march theme ... the one that 's hard to get out of one 's head . 5 On a scale of Excellent , Good , Fair , and Poor , Thunderbirds Are Go rates : On a scale of Excellent , Good , Fair , and Poor , Thunderbird 6 rates : Packaging : Two Keep cases in card box with toy extras Footnotes : 1 . Sylvia Anderson was approached by Stanley Kubrick about 2001 : A Space Odyssey but did n't get involved ; Derek Meddings later had his feature chance with expert minature effects work on several James Bond films , creating many underwater views and miniature explosions that are nigh undetectable . Meddings was a hero to my boss on 1941 , effects miniature maker Gregory Jein . 2 . This observation is probably in poor taste , but Savant always thought it suspicious that the Tracys were rarely seen to walk or move about under their own power , as if they were really all paraplegics ! Actually , the limitations of marionette work required direction geared around this lack of mobility . This gives the shows an odd cutting pattern that director David Lane sometimes seems to be trying to make fun of ... but not very successfully . 3 . I 've always thought that the good actor Derren Nesbitt ( Where Eagles Dare , Victim ) looked exactly like an Anderson puppet creation . Peter Cook and Dudley Moore did a reportedly perfect live - action takeoff on the Thunderbirds as a television sketch . The new live - action Thunderbirds movie ( that motivated this DVD release ) seems more a variation on Spy Kids than anything to do with the TV original . 4 . The ship 's anti-gravity apparatus is knocked out during the gunfight . So why does the Skyship stay aloft ? Or did I misread the film and it 's really a balloon ? The ship looks like a big fat silver cigarette case , but is more interesting than the unwieldy Zero X from the first feature . 5 . Hey , it 's really F.A.B.! Could n't resist . \" Go , Savant \" - I mean , \" Savant Are Go ! \" I edited the 6 mini docus on the discs and need to add this disclaimer to my opinions ... they were a lot of fun to cut , real Boys - With - Toys fun . \" Vrroom !

True anemonefish , Amphiprion percula , are nearly identical , but have subtle differences in shape and live in different habitats . Characteristics Bright orange with three distinctive white bars , clown anemonefish are among the most recognizable of all reef-dwellers . They reach about 4.3 inches in length , and are named for the multicolored sea anemone in which they make their homes . Relationship with Anemones Clownfish perform an elaborate dance with an anemone before taking up residence , gently touching its tentacles with different parts of their bodies until they are acclimated to their host . A layer of mucus on the clownfish 's skin makes it immune to the fish -eating anemone 's lethal sting . In exchange for safety from predators and food scraps , the clownfish drives off intruders and preens its host , removing parasites . Population Range There are at least 30 known species of clownfish , most of which live in the shallow waters of the Indian Ocean , the Red Sea , and the western Pacific . They are not found in the Caribbean , Mediterranean , or Atlantic Ocean . Changing Sex Surprisingly , all clownfish are born male . They have the ability to switch their sex , but will do so only to become the dominant female of a group . The change is irreversible ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Read | Pak worked phones , rang alarm bells \u2014 but how it was nudged to yield in India 's favour The evidence is critical to establishing use of the F - 16s in the air strike since the US , which sold the fighter jets to Pakistan , does not allow these platforms to be used in an offensive role . India had strongly opposed the US decision to sell eight F - 16s to Pakistan in 2016 , which also could not pass the muster in US Congress for Foreign Military Funding . This meant that the order was never placed . In June 2006 , Pakistan had ordered 500 AIM- 120C -5 AMRAAM missiles for $ 269.6 million to equip its F-16C \/ D Block 50\/52 + and F-16A \/ B Block 15 MLU fighters .

PHOTOS | India rejects Pakistan 's F -16 denial , shows proof AMRAAM missiles allow a fighter pilot to target an enemy aircraft that is beyond visual range , in day or night , and in all weather conditions . The AMRAAM has an autonomous guidance capability , which allows the pilot to manoeuvre immediately after missile launch . Pakistan agreed to buy about 70 F - 16s in the 1980s , and about 40 were delivered before Congress cut off all aid and military sales in 1990 , citing Pakistan 's secret development of nuclear weapons under the Pressler Amendment . In 2006 , Pakistan was a major recipient of American arms sales , including the $ 1.4 - billion purchase of up to 36 new F - 16C \/ D fighter aircraft and $ 640 million in missiles and bombs .

Cultural differences explained the contrast to some extent , but the primary divergence was economic . Saint - Domingue was the most productive agricultural colony in the Western Hemisphere , and its output contributed heavily to the economy of France . By contrast , Santo Domingo was a small colony with little impact on the economy of Spain . Prosperous French plantation owners sought to maximize their gain through increased production for a growing world market . Thus , they imported great numbers of slaves from Africa and drove this captive work force ruthlessly . Although by the end of the eighteenth century economic conditions were improving , landowners in Santo Domingo did not enjoy the same level of wealth attained by their French counterparts in Saint -Domingue . The absence of market - driven pressure to increase production enabled the domestic labor force to practice subsistence agriculture and to export at low levels . For this reason , Santo Domingo imported far fewer slaves than did Saint -Domingue . Spanish law also allowed a slave to purchase his freedom and that of his family for a relatively small sum . This contributed to the higher proportion of freedmen in the Spanish colony ; by the turn of the century , freedmen actually constituted the majority of the population . Also in contrast to conditions in the French colony , this population profile contributed to a somewhat more egalitarian society , plagued much less by the schisms of race . Stimulated to some degree by a revolution against the monarchy that was well underway in France , the inevitable explosion took place in Saint - Domingue in August 1791 . The initial reaction of many Spanish colonists to news of the slaughter of Frenchmen by armies of rebellious black slaves was to flee Hispaniola entirely . Spain , however , saw in the unrest an opportunity to seize all , or part , of the western third of the island through an alliance of convenience with the British . These intentions , however , did not survive encounters in the field with forces led by the former slave , Fran\u00e7ois - Dominique Toussaint Louverture . In recognition of his leadership against the Spanish ( under whose banner he had begun his military career ) , the British , and rebellious royalists and mulattoes , Toussaint was named governor general of Saint - Domingue by the French Republic in 1796 . By the next year , Spain had surrendered the entire island to his rule . This action reflected not only Spain 's growing disengagement from its colony , but also its setbacks in Europe and its relative decline as a world power . Although France nominally enjoyed sovereignty over the entire island of Hispaniola , it was prevented from establishing an effective presence or administration in the east by continuing conflict between the indigenous forces led by Toussaint -- and later by Jean -Jacques Dessalines -- and an expeditionary force dispatched to Hispaniola by Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte in 1802 in an effort to bring the island more firmly under French control . Upon defeating the French , Dessalines and his followers established the independent nation of Haiti in January 1804 . A small French presence , however , remained in the former Spanish colony . Dessalines attempted to take the city of Santo Domingo in March 1805 , but he turned back after receiving reports of the approach of a French naval squadron . By 1808 a number of \u00e9migr\u00e9 Spanish landowners had returned to Santo Domingo . These royalists had no intention of living under French rule , however , and they sought foreign assistance for a rebellion that would restore Spanish sovereignty . Help came from the Haitians , who provided arms , and from the British , who occupied Saman\u00e1 and blockaded the port of Santo Domingo . The remaining French representatives fled the island in July 1809 . The 1809 restoration of Spanish rule ushered in an era referred to by some historians as Espa\u00f1a Boba ( Foolish Spain ) . Under the despotic rule of Ferdinand VII , the colony 's economy deteriorated severely . Some Dominicans began to wonder if their interests would not best be served by the sort of independence movement that was sweeping the South American colonies . In keeping with this sentiment , Spanish lieutenant governor Jos\u00e9 N\u00fa\u00f1ez de C\u00e1ceres announced the colony 's independence as the state of Spanish Haiti on November 30 , 1821 . C\u00e1ceres requested admission to the Republic of Gran Colombia ( consisting of what later became Colombia , Ecuador , and Venezuela ) , recently proclaimed established by Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar and his followers . While the request was in transit , however , the president of Haiti , Jean - Pierre Boyer , decided to invade Santo Domingo and to reunite the island under the Haitian flag . The twenty - two years of Haitian occupation witnessed a steady economic decline and a growing resentment of Haiti among Dominicans . The agricultural pattern in the former Spanish colony came to resemble the one prevailing in all of Haiti at the time -- that is , mainly subsistence cultivation with little or no production of export crops . Boyer attempted to enforce in the new territory the Rural Code ( Code Rural ) he had decreed in an effort to improve productivity among the Haitian yeomanry , but the Dominicans proved no more willing to adhere to its provisions than the Haitians had been . Increasing numbers of Dominican landowners chose to flee the island rather than to live under Haitian rule ; in many cases , Haitian administrators encouraged such emigration , confiscated the holdings of the \u00e9migr\u00e9s , and redistributed them to Haitian officials . Aside from such bureaucratic machinations , most of the Dominicans ' resentment of Haitian rule developed because Boyer , the ruler of an impoverished country , did not ( or could not ) provision his army . The occupying Haitian forces lived off the land in Santo Domingo , commandeering or confiscating what they needed to perform their duties or to fill their stomachs . Dominicans saw this as tribute demanded by petty conquerors , or as simple theft . Racial animosities also affected attitudes on both sides ; black Haitian troops reacted with reflexive resentment against lighter - skinned Dominicans , while Dominicans came to associate the Haitians ' dark skin with the oppression and the abuses of occupation . Religious and cultural life also suffered under the Haitian occupation . The Haitians , who associated the Roman Catholic Church with the French colonists who had so cruelly exploited and abused them before independence , confiscated all church property in the east , deported all foreign clergy , and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the Vatican . For Dominicans , who were much more strongly Roman Catholic and less oriented toward folk religion than the Haitians , such actions seemed insulting and nihilistic . In addition , upper-class Haitians considered French culture superior to Spanish culture , while Haitian soldiers and others from the lower class simply disregarded Hispanic mores and customs . The emigration of upper-class Dominicans served to forestall rebellion and to prolong the period of Haitian occupation because most Dominicans reflexively looked to the upper class for leadership . Scattered unrest and isolated confrontations between Haitians and Dominicans undoubtedly occurred ; it was not until 1838 , however , that any significant organized movement against Haitian domination began . Crucial to these stirrings was a twenty - year - old Dominican , of a prominent Santo Domingo family , who had returned home five years earlier after seven years of study in Europe . The young student 's name was Juan Pablo Duarte . Dominican history can in many ways be encompassed by a series of biographies . The personality and attributes of Duarte , however , ran counter to those of most of the country 's caudillos . Duarte was an idealist , an ascetic , a genuine nationalist , a man of principle , and a romantic in a romantic age . Although he played no significant part in its rule , he is considered the father of his country . He certainly provided the inspiration and impetus for the achievement of independence from Haiti . Shocked , when he returned from Europe , by the deteriorated condition of Santo Domingo , the young student resolved to establish a resistance movement that would eventually throw off the Haitian yoke . He dubbed his movement La Trinitaria ( The Trinity ) because its original nine members had organized themselves into cells of three ; the cells went on to recruit as separate organizations , maintaining strict secrecy , with little or no direct contact among themselves in order to minimize the possibility of detection or betrayal to the Haitian authorities . Young recruits flocked to Duarte 's banner ( almost literally , for it was Duarte who designed the modern Dominican flag ) as a result of the pent - up resentment under Haitian rule . Despite its elaborate codes and clandestine procedures , La Trinitaria was eventually betrayed to the Haitians . It survived largely intact , however , emerging under the new designation , La Filantr\u00f3pica , to continue its work of anti-Haitian agitation . Despite their numbers and their base of popular support , the Trinitarios ( as the rebels still referred to themselves ) required a political disruption in Haiti proper to boost their movement toward its ultimate success . The overthrow of Boyer in the Revolution of 1843 provided a catalyst for the Dominican rebels . Charles Rivi\u00e8re- H\u00e9rard replaced Boyer as president of Haiti . Like most Haitian leaders , he required a transition period in which to deal with competitors and to solidify his rule . Rivi\u00e8re - Herard apparently identified one disaffected Haitian faction in the administration of the eastern territory ; his crackdown on this group extended to the Trinitarios as well , because apparently there had been some fruitless contacts between the Dominicans and some liberal Haitians . The increased pressure induced Duarte to leave the country temporarily in search of support in other Latin American states , mainly Colombia and Venezuela . In December 1843 , a group of Duarte 's followers urged him to return to Santo Domingo . They feared that their plans for an insurrection might be betrayed to the Haitians and had therefore resolved to carry them through quickly . Duarte sailed as far north from Caracas as the island of Cura\u00e7ao , where he fell victim to a violent illness . When he had not arrived home by February 1844 , the rebels , under the leadership of Francisco del Rosario S\u00e1nchez and Ram\u00f3n Mella , agreed to launch their uprising without him . On February 27 , 1844 -- thereafter celebrated as Dominican Independence Day -- the rebels seized the Ozama fortress in the capital . The Haitian garrison , taken by surprise and apparently betrayed by at least one of its sentries , retired in disarray . Within two days , all Haitian officials had left Santo Domingo . Mella headed the provisional governing junta of the new Dominican Republic . Duarte , finally recovered , returned to his country on March 14 . The following day he entered the capital amidst great adulation and celebration . As is so often the case in such circumstances , the optimism generated by revolutionary triumph would eventually give way to the disillusion caused by the struggle for power .

Miscellaneous items . MONUMENTS , MARKERS , AND TABLETS . The statues erected by the State of Pennsylvania to Gens . Geary , Hays , and Humphreys in 1915 , and transferred to the United States were to have been dedicated in October , 1917 , the date was changed to October 3 , 1918 , then was postponed to July 1 , 1919 . The ceremonies were to have been held at the Pennsylvania Memorial , but owing to the death of Gen. H. S. Huidekoper , November 9 , 1918 , chairman of the commission that erected these statues , the dedication was again postponed . There have been no monuments or markers erected on the battle field during the fiscal year , except the Gen . Lee headquarters marker and tablet , located on the Chambersburg Pike to the north of the Lutheran Theological Seminary . Bronze and iron tablets have been erected as follows : A bronze tablet was mounted on the Second Massachusetts Monument by a committee of the regiment on June 11 , 1918 . Col. E. H. Haskell , of Boston , Mass. , and Dr. Fred W. Owen , of Morristown , N.J. ( of Gen. Webbs staff ) , on May 1 , 1919 , visited Little Round Top and selected a place on the surface of a large bowlder on the summit to mount a tablet as a memorial to the United States Signal Corps . This tablet has been placed in position and was dedicated with appropriate ceremonies May 16 , 1919 , and the Itinerary Tablet of the Army of the Potomac in front of W. P. Englars house at Uniontown , Md. , was moved to a better position by agreement with the chairman . There is no new action to report in relation to the proposed erection of bronze statues to Gens .

Camp Colt was established in the park in the spring of 1918 , using the buildings , water system , drill , and parade grounds of the camps established in center of the park in 1917 . Nearly all the troops of the Tank Corps and all the other troops have moved away or been mustered out of the service , leaving a very small guard and the United States property in charge of the quartermasters department . Action has been taken to abandon the camp and sell the buildings . Bids have been asked to dismantle the camp ground and restore it to its original condition . CAMP EQUIPMENT . On May 24 , 1919 , the camp equipment , consisting of the buildings , drain , sewer , and water pipes was sold to the Lewis Wrecking Co. , of Rock Island , Ill. , by the Quartermasters Department , United States Army . A set of specifications designating the work to be done in restoring the park land after the removal of the camp equipment was prepared by the commission and a copy was sent to the chief of construction , Washington , D.C. , with the request that it be incorporated in the contract for sale . A copy was also furnished the quartermaster in charge of Camp Colt , and a copy was furnished by him to the purchaser . Six months time was allowed the purchaser for the removal of the buildings , pipes , and the restoring of the land as far as practical to its former condition . The dismantling of the buildings and the work of removing the pipes is now being done on the privateowned land . A large number of the buildings have been sold , but as yet few have been removed from the park land , and the work to be done here will not likely be completed before the winter . The wrecking company has a reputation for fair dealing and the work of restoring the land will be carried out as far as possible . About 4,500 cords of wood belonging to the Government and not included in the sale of the camp remained on the park land . Bids for the sale of this are now being received and when sold will be removed . CULTIVATION OF UNITED STATES LAND UNDER LEASE . There were 19 properties with a total acreage of 1,400 acres under lease during the year . As in the preceding year over 200 acres of land belonging to the Codori , Trostle , Smith , and the Bryan properties were used as part of the site of Camp Colt , thereby reducing the acreage actually under cultivation , and production of farm crops . A detailed statement of all the crops raised during the year as well as the number of the live stock kept by the tenants was compiled and reported to the commission at the end of the year . During the year a change of tenants was made at the Hummelbaugh , Bryan , Althoff , Wentz , and Masonheimer properties . On account of the advance in prices of farm products , an advance of $ 263 was made in the rents of the tenants . Rents have all been promptly paid , the properties , as a rule , are well kept , and are under the personal supervision of the forrester , William C. Storrick , a practical and thorough farmer , and the production of crops compare favorably with those of other parts of the State . FARMS . Mr. William C. Storrick has the leasing of the 19 farms belonging to the United States in the park and looks after the repairs to buildings , etc. ; he directs the tenants in their farm work and has a general supervision over all farm matters . LAND NOT UNDER LEASE . The plots of land that were given by the chairman of the commission last year to pupils of Gettysburg schools for cultivation as war gardens were given out again this year . The work done by them was creditable and the results obtained very satisfactory both as to quantity and quality . The size of the plots , numbering 25 in all , range in size from oneeighth to 1 acre . The pupils were required to make a complete report at the end of the season , which was compiled and reported to the chairman of the commission . Lieut . Col. Emmor B. Cope entered on his duties as the engineer July 17 , 1893 . Served with distinction during the war , 18611865 , upon the staffs of Gens . Meade and Warren , and breveted for gallant and meritorious services . His assistance from his presence in the battle has been invaluable , faithful , loyal , and efficient . His aid to the commission merits their grateful acknowledgment . The statues to Gens . Doubleday and Robinson , mentioned in report of 1918 as having been dedicated with appropriate ceremonies , although not at that time finished , have been completed . Three iron tablets were contracted for by the commission and have been erected as follows : Joness C.S.A. Brigade Tablet between Orrtanna and Fairfield on the Fairfield and Orrtanna Road . Imbodens C.S.A. Brigade Tablet at Cashtown , Pa. Robertsons C.S.A. Brigade Tablet at Orrtanna , Pa. Five iron tablets were purchased and have been placed along the piked avenues in the park . PIKED AVENUES AND PUBLIC ROADS . Bids were asked in June , 1918 , to pike an avenue on the land acquired from the Gettysburg Electric Co. along the south side of the United States National Cemetery and the Evergreen Cemetery from Baltimore Pike to Taneytown Road . There was but one bid . It was not excessive and was accepted by the commission and submitted to the War Department . No authority has been given to construct this avenue . At the request of Maj. D. D. Eisenhower , U.S.A. , commander of Camp Colt , and in consultation with Capt. F. B. Moore , quartermaster , an agreement was made with the Gettysburg National Park Commission to rebuild 1 mile of the Emmitsburg Road which had been destroyed by the heavy United States trucks , the commission to furnish crushed stone , tear up the surface of the road , do the rolling and sprinkling , and furnish an inspector . The Quartermaster Department to furnish the trucks to haul the stone and the labor to load them at the quarry and spread on the road , after which the rolling and sprinkling would be done . The quartermaster promised to order road oil and oil the surface of the road when in proper condition after the rolling . On September 1 , 1918 , a contract was made , with the approval of the Secretary of War , with M. & T. E. Farrell to supply the commissions part of the work for $ 5,760 , to be finished December 31 , 1918 . The work went on until the armistice was signed , in November , as the quartermasters part of the work was being done with Army trucks and enlisted men . There was trouble after that in having the hauling and spreading done . The agreement on the part of the Quartermaster Department was never completed , consequently the National Park Commission was obliged to hire trucks and employ labor to finish the work . Samuel Robinson was paid $ 750 for hauling stone ; labor furnished by the commission , $ 611.65 ; extra materials used , $ 250.92 . A total cost of $ 7,372.57 that had to be paid by the commission to rebuild the 1 mile of piking . SCREENINGS . Screenings were contracted for and delivered during the fiscal year as follows : Samuel Robinson furnished and spread 1,500 tons of limestone screenings at $ 4,700 ; M. & T. E. Farrell furnished at their quarry on Rock Creek 680 tons at $ 1,387 . They also furnished to rebuild the Emmitsburg Road 2,000 tons at $ 4,080 . Total paid for screenings , $ 10,167 . OILING THE CURVES AND GRADES OF AVENUES . A contract was made with the Atlantic Refining Co. to oil the grades of the avenues and from 100 to 250 feet of each curve . The whole distance to be oiled was estimated at 7 miles , an average width of 18 feet . This was done in July , at a cost of $ 3,645 . It has been the custom for a number of years to pound down the paving stone of the avenue gutters and also the sod along the banks of the gutters as soon as the frost is out of the ground in the spring . This was done in March , and 5 barrels of herbicide were ordered and have been used to kill the weeds in the gutters and sides of the avenues . There are 30 1\/2 miles of these gutters on the battle field ; no new paving has been done during the fiscal year owing to the encampment of troops here , and the uncertainty of the length of time the national park would be used as a camp ground . GUN CARRIAGES . Six gun carriages have been added to the guns marking the positions of four Confederate batteries , and one pyramid of shells set up at each gun . The cost , including gun carriages , foundation , and pyramids was $ 960 . The guards have been reporting much petty pilfering , principally from the gun carriages in the park at places and times when guards are not in sight and at night . Many small parts of the gun carriages were unscrewed and carried away and have to be constantly renewed , which is troublesome as well as expensive . Some chipping from the granite markers and monuments has also been reported . PAINTING . Three painters are at work painting the gun carriages and guns , avenue fencing , iron tablets , bridges , railings , etc . They also polish the surface of the lettering on the bronze tablets . MOWING . The mowing in the park has been kept up as reported from year to year , except where the grounds have been occupied by the tents and buildings of Camp Colt . It would be economy to change the method of mowing by the use of modern machinery . CARE OF THE GROVES . A force of workmen has been engaged during the summer and autumn of 1918 and spring of 1919 in the various groves of the park . They have cut out the dead limbs and dead trees , trimmed the unsightly ones and much underbrush and have very much improved the appearance of Powers Hill , Culps Hill , Little Round Top , Reynolds Grove , part of the tract east of Little Round Top , along United States Avenue and North Confederate Avenue . SODDING . Sodding has been continued . All the banks and monument mounds along Slocum Avenue , Geary Avenue , East Confederate and West Confederate Avenues , all the banks and mounds on the First Days Battlefield , and on Little Round Top . About 10,000 square yards of sod were used . CAVALRY FIELDS . During the year the condition of South Cavalry Field has been much improved . The dilapidated barbwire fence has been removed and sold and a post fence erected . A new concrete culvert was built at the intersection of the Emmitsburg road and new water drains put in at the crossing at the Ridge Road . East Cavalry Field has been kept in good condition and all the mowing , trimming , repairs to fencing , and care of the avenues has been done by the man on duty there . A short section of the barbwire fencing remaining is to be removed , and a post fence erected . The entire line will then consist of the same find of fence . Grass seed was sown on the old roadbed , and it is now generally well sodded . CONCRETE WORK . A large party of workmen are engaged at this work principally at culverts , walks , foundations , and repairs to damages by the troops over the battlefield . They have built a number of culverts and pipe walls , repaired many cap stones and shell stones which are constantly being knocked off and damaged by reckless driving of autos and trucks . The cement walk from Confederate Avenue to Round Top Tower , 1,300 feet long , 4 feet wide , was rebuilt by the concrete builders of the commission with much labor and expense . All the material and appliances had to be hauled to the foot of Round Top and the concrete mixed there and then hauled up the steep slope by horse and sled . This was successfully accomplished and the walk built under the direction of the efficient assistant superintendent , Mr. James B. Aumen . Respectfully submitted . JOHN P. NICHOLSON , Chairman . * * * * * * * Source : Annual Reports of the Secretary of War National Archives and Records Administration Washington , DC"},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Yet , debate is increasing on the legalisation of drugs for non-medical purposes , particularly cannabis . Models under development for the legal supply of cannabis are described in this analysis , as well as some of the questions they raise . Part of the ' Perspectives on drugs ' ( PODs ) series , launched alongside the annual European Drug Report , these designed - for - the - web interactive analyses aim to provide deeper insights into a selection of important issues . Update date : PDF version The international legal framework on drug control is provided by three United Nations conventions , which instruct countries to limit drug supply and use to medical and scientific purposes . Nevertheless , there is increasing debate over legalisation of drugs for non-medical purposes , and of cannabis in particular . Such proposals raise concerns over increases in use and harms and questions about the ways in which the distribution of cannabis for non-medical purposes could be carefully regulated to mitigate these . In the EU , a system of limited distribution has evolved in the Netherlands since the 1970s , with further developments in the last few years . Detailed proposals for non-medical cannabis regulation were initiated in two states in the United States and in Uruguay at the end of 2012 , which entered into force in 2014 , the year when two more US states and Washington DC voted to allow for the supply and distribution of the drug . These are different models that are being closely observed to understand the advantages and disadvantages of a particular regulated system . In addition to these systems , the model of ' cannabis social clubs ' has been increasingly mentioned in drug policy debates . Its advocates argue that policies of non-prosecution of individuals in some countries can be equally applied to registered groups of individuals , to effectively permit a closed production and distribution system . At present , the model is rejected by national authorities in Europe . In the Netherlands , the cultivation , supply and possession of cannabis are criminal offences , punishable with sentences including prison . However , a practice of tolerance , first set out in local guidelines in 1979 , has evolved into the present - day concept of ' coffee shops ' , cannabis sales outlets licensed by the municipality . About two -thirds of municipalities do not allow coffee shops , and the number of coffee shops across the country is steadily decreasing , from 846 in 1999 to 614 in 2013 . The sale of small quantities of cannabis to over - 18s in coffee shops is tolerated in an attempt to keep adults who experiment with cannabis away from other , more dangerous , drugs . The coffee shop may be closed down and the operator or owner may be prosecuted if he or she does not meet the Prosecutor General 's criteria , which prohibit advertising , nuisance , sale to minors or non-residents , and sale of hard drugs or alcohol , and limits sales to 5 g per transaction . A scheme to convert coffee shops into closed clubs with registered members was trialled and then dropped in 2012 , but from January 2013 coffee shops were restricted to residents of the Netherlands only , to be proven by identity card or residence permit . Nevertheless , implementation and enforcement of this rule varies by municipality . A proposal to limit coffee shop sales to cannabis products with THC levels of under 15 % remains pending , as enforcement issues are addressed . No more than 5 g per person may be sold in any one transaction and the coffee shop is not allowed to keep more than 500 g of cannabis in stock . Yet wholesale cultivation and distribution of cannabis is not tolerated in the Netherlands , resulting in what is known as ' the back - door problem ' , i.e. drugs may be sold at the front but not supplied at the back . Although there have been many discussions on this inconsistency , to date no solution has been agreed . Alongside the coffee shop system , cultivation and possession of small amounts of cannabis ( up to 5 g ) for personal use will in principle not be prosecuted . An evaluation of Dutch drug policy in 2009 found that the coffee shops were the main source of cannabis for users ( but not the only source ) , the markets for soft and hard drugs remained separate , and adult cannabis use was relatively low compared to other European countries . However , underage use was high ( whether due to coffee shops , greater acceptance of use , or other factors ) , there was serious nuisance from drug tourism , and the sector is increasingly commercialised and of interest to organised crime ( 1 ) . The most recent legal developments were partly in response to this evaluation . On 1 March 2015 a new article to the Opium Act came into force , prohibiting activities that prepare or facilitate the illegal cultivation and trafficking of cannabis . In 2012 , US voters in Colorado and Washington State approved proposals to establish state - wide systems for the regulated distribution of cannabis for non-medical purposes ( as distinct from the ' medical marijuana ' systems that already existed in 18 US states ) . The systems ' stated aims are to free up resources to fight violent and property crimes , regulate the visible trade and gain tax revenue from that trade . As in the Netherlands , the systems utilise licensed outlets , establish age limits ( 21 years , as for alcohol ) , restrict advertising , limit personal possession ( to 1 oz \/ 28 g ) and prohibit use in public . Unlike the Netherlands , they establish a state licensing system for production and processing to supply the outlets . The systems became operational in Colorado in January 2014 and in Washington State in July 2014 . Implementing rules have been established with parallels to alcohol and tobacco regulation . Both states had pre-existing medical cannabis industries . And in the case of Colorado the constitutional avenue through which non-medical cannabis was legalised and the existence of a powerful medical cannabis industry has impeded the development of strict regulations that are designed primarily to protect public health . To date , no significant reports from Colorado or Washington State suggest that initial concerns about increased crime , motor vehicle accidents and lost productivity have come to pass ; long - term health and social impacts will require more time to be properly assessed . It should be made clear that in both states loosely regulated medical marijuana had already existed for several years , making these legal changes more gradual than they appear . Some health professionals have raised legitimate concerns about the sale of some very potent edible products . For the calendar year 2015 Colorado reported USD 114 million revenue from taxes and licence fees , while Washington State reported approximately USD 129 million . In November 2014 the states of Oregon and Alaska voted in favour of similar regulatory systems , while Washington DC voted for a system that would legalise only home growing and non-commercial transfer of up to 28 g ( i.e. no sales outlets ) . Again , medical marijuana markets had existed in each of these jurisdictions , reinforcing the fact that the move toward legal non-medical cannabis is not made in a single leap . In Oregon medical marijuana dispensaries can sell non-medical marijuana from October 2015 until the end of 2016 , when separate shops will be licensed ; in Alaska , unlike the other states , retail and on - site consumption ( ' coffee shops ' ) are planned . These state - wide systems are in direct contravention of US federal law , where both possession and supply of cannabis are criminal offences . The US Department of Justice issued guidance in August 2013 directing federal prosecutors to prioritise eight enforcement areas , including sale to minors , revenue going to criminal gangs and diversion to other states ( 2 ) . Beyond these areas , the federal government will rely on states to enforce their laws . Further guidance was issued in February 2014 for financial institutions to provide services to marijuana- related businesses ( 3 ) ; this is also a federal crime but the resulting sizes of cash transactions and storage had become a law enforcement concern in itself . Meanwhile , similar proposals for regulation are being drafted in a number of additional US states in preparation for November 2016 , though in the state of Vermont it is the legislature , rather than the voters , that is expressing interest in enacting a regulatory model . In Uruguay a national law of 2013 allows the state to regulate the supply and use of cannabis through three channels . The law allows for registered users to grow at home , belong to a cannabis social club , or acquire government - regulated cannabis through licensed pharmacies . The law 's stated goal is to reduce the harm caused by the illicit market and provide education and prevention opportunities . All users must register with the state . This is administered by the Institute for the Control and Regulation of Cannabis ( IRCCA ) . Users may have up to six plants in flower in their home , or buy up to 40 g per month from a pharmacy , or join a cannabis club of 15\u201345 members growing up to 99 plants ; again , all growers and users must be registered at the IRCCA . Unauthorised cultivation or supply remains punishable by 20 months to 10 years in prison . While the home and club growing models have become operational from October 2014 , the pharmacy supply has been delayed by cultivation issues and is expected to start in late 2016 . A more detailed comparison of cannabis regulations in North and South America is published by CICAD , the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission ( 4 ) . | Netherlands || Washington State ||Colorado State ||Uruguay ||Oregon State || Alaska State || District of Colombia | | Level of law || National prosecutor guidelines || State law ( conflict with federal law ) || State constitution ( conflict with federal law ) || National law || State law ( conflict with federal law ) || State law ( conflict with federal law ) || State law ( conflict with federal law ) | | Regulatory Body || Municipality || Washington State Liquor Control Board || Colorado Department of Revenue || Institute for the Control and Regulation of Cannabis || Oregon Liquor Control Commission ( LCC ) || Alcoholic Beverage Control Board ||N\/A| | Age limit for possession ||18||21||21||18||21||21 ||21 | | Growing at home || Prohibited , but no prosecution if no more than five plants for own use . || Not allowed || Up to six plants , three in flower ( can not be sold ) || Up to six plants \/ 480 g|| Up to four plants || Up to six plants || Six plants , only three in flower .

This does not mean that the behaviour is legal , as non-criminal penalties may still be applied . With respect to the drug debate , this concept is usually used to describe laws addressing personal possession or use rather than drug supply . Depenalisation refers to introducing the possibility or policy of closing a criminal case without proceeding towards punishment , for example as the case is considered ' minor ' or prosecution is ' not in the public interest ' . Legalisation refers to making an act lawful when previously it was prohibited . In the context of drugs , this usually refers to the removal of all criminal and non-criminal sanctions , although other regulations may limit the extent of the permission . This term is generally used in the context of drug supply . Regulation implies that a set of rules and restrictions is placed around the supply or use of a substance , as is the case for alcohol and tobacco . Regulatory systems usually place limits on access , such as age limits and control of outlets , and may place restrictions on advertising . Penalties for breaching these rules may be criminal or non-criminal . Cannabis social clubs operate on the principle that , if one person will not be prosecuted for cultivating one cannabis plant in private for his or her own use , then 20 people should not be prosecuted for cultivating 20 plants together in private for their own use . Clearly this concept is not without problems . Establishing what constitutes ' shared ' production , for example , is problematic and there is the general issue of how activities can be legally distinguished from supply offences . Across the European Union , drug supply offences themselves have varying legal definitions but usually require the passing of drugs between persons and some quantity criteria may also apply . In response , cannabis social clubs have tried to establish operating rules in order to avoid charges of trafficking , drug supply or encouraging drug use . For example , the advocacy group Encod ( 1 ) has proposed that clubs should operate as a collective agreement , with a register of members , costs calculated to reflect expected individual consumption and the amount produced per person limited and intended for immediate consumption . Clubs should be closed to the public and new members should be established cannabis users who are accepted only by invitation . This model , although promoted by activists in Belgium , France , Spain and Germany , is nevertheless not tolerated by national authorities in any European country . This means that cannabis social clubs are likely to be subject to legal sanctions should they be identified or at best may be operating in a legal grey area . Currently , it is difficult to establish to what extent these social clubs exist in Europe , although they do appear to be rare . The city of Utrecht in the Netherlands announced a project to develop such a club in 2011 , but the project has not yet been implemented . Some clubs report that they are operating on a limited basis in some Spanish regions , taking advantage of the fact that , although production , supply and personal possession of cannabis in public are prohibited under Spanish law , possession in private spaces is not penalised . The legal position on shared consumption is more complicated , but in 2015 three judgments from the Supreme Court in Spain concluded that organised , institutionalised and persistent cultivation and distribution of cannabis among an association open to new members is considered drug trafficking ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

If you\u2019re like 93 percent of people, your answer isn\u2019t the office. According to a FlexJobs survey of over 3,100 professionals, only 7 percent of workers say the office is their location of choice if they need to be most productive on important work-related projects.\nMore than half (51 percent) of people said that their home is their preferred place to work. Eight percent said they would choose a coffee shop, coworking space, library, or other place besides the office and another 8 percent would choose the office, but only outside regular hours. Twenty-six percent go to the office during regular hours to complete important work because it\u2019s not an option to leave.\nAnd that\u2019s just the tip of the informational iceberg that is FlexJobs\u2019 5th Annual Super Survey. We also put together a report on the responses of working parents who took our survey, which was released earlier this month. And read our report on the information from baby boomers who took our survey. Read on to find out how professionals feel about flexible jobs, where and how they\u2019d prefer to work, their reasons for wanting work flexibility, and how employers benefit, too.\nFull Results from FlexJobs\u2019 5th Annual Super Survey\nFlexible Work Options and Productivity\nAccording to FlexJobs\u2019 survey, 65 percent of workers think they would be more productive telecommuting than working in a traditional workplace.\nThe top reasons people are, or would be, most productive working at home versus the office include:\n- fewer interruptions from colleagues (76 percent)\n- fewer distractions (75 percent)\n- less frequent meetings (69 percent)\n- a reduction in office politics (68 percent)\n- reduced stress from commuting (67 percent)\n- a more comfortable office environment (51 percent)\nWho\u2019s Seeking Flexible Work Options and Why\nWe often assume that flexible work appeals to a wide variety of professionals for different reasons, but this survey really shows how true that is.\nSurvey respondents identified themselves as:\n- working parents (39 percent)\n- freelancers (26 percent)\n- introverts (21 percent)\n- entrepreneurs (20 percent)\n- caretakers (16 percent)\n- travelers\/digital nomads (11 percent)\n- disabled or managing a chronic illness (11 percent)\n- students (9 percent)\n- environmentalists (4.4 percent)\n- military spouses (2 percent)\nWhen asked WHY they want or need flexible work options, people said:\n- they need to pay for basic necessities (80 percent)\n- they need to save for retirement (65 percent)\n- they need to pay off debt (59 percent)\n- they want to travel (58 percent)\n- they want to have a professional impact in the world (41 percent)\n- they want to contribute to charity (28 percent)\n- they need to pay for continuing education for themselves (25 percent)\nHow Important Flexwork Is to People\nWe asked people to rank the most important factors of a job when evaluating a job prospect. The top factors included:\n- work flexibility (80 percent)\n- work-life balance and salary tied (74 percent)\n- health insurance (43 percent)\n- company reputation (41 percent)\n- 401(k)\/retirement benefits (31 percent)\nFlexible work has also played a role in why people leave jobs and seek new opportunities:\n- 33 percent reported having left a job because it did not have work flexibility\n- 14 percent have considered leaving a job because it did not have work flexibility\n- 18 percent are currently looking for a new job because of work flexibility issues\nIn fact, flexible work options have become so important to people that very few worry about whether or not getting a flexible job will negatively impact the trajectory of their careers. Only 3 percent of respondents worry \u201ca lot\u201d that a flexible work arrangement will hurt their career progression.\nWhat People Would Trade to Work from Home\nProfessionals reported being willing to make trades in exchange for telecommuting options:\n- 29 percent of respondents said they would take a 10 percent or 20 percent cut in pay\n- 22 percent are willing to forfeit vacation time\n- 15 percent said they would give up employer-matching retirement contributions\n- 81 percent of respondents also say they would be more loyal to their employers if they had flexible work options\nReasons for Wanting Flexible Work\nSince 2013, four reasons for wanting flexible work options have dominated our survey:\n- work-life balance (79 percent)\n- family (52 percent)\n- time savings (48 percent)\n- commute stress (47 percent)\nCommuting to work is a concern for many: Time savings has outranked cost savings as a factor in seeking flexible work for the past four years. That might be because 72 percent of today\u2019s flexible job seekers reported having round-trip commutes over double the national average, which is approximately 50 minutes.\nPeople surveyed believe flexible options would positively impact their health:\n- 97 percent say a job with flexibility would have a positive impact on their overall quality of life.\n- 79 percent think it would make them more healthy.\n- 87 percent think it would lower their stress.\nMost Desired Types of Flexible Work\nTelecommuting remains the most popular form of flexible work, and those who\u2019ve already worked remotely are increasing the amount of time they spend working from home. Of those who telecommuted in 2015, 22 percent telecommuted more this year than last year.\nWhen asked to choose which types of flexibility they\u2019re most interested, survey respondents said:\n- 100 percent telecommuting (86 percent)\n- flexible schedule (73 percent)\n- partial telecommuting (49 percent)\n- part-time (48 percent)\n- alternative (48 percent)\n- freelance (44 percent)\nDemographic Breakdown of the 3,153 Respondents\n- Age: 20\u201329 (12 percent), 30\u201349 (54 percent), 50\u201359 (23 percent), 60+ (11 percent)\n- Education: high school degree or equivalent (4 percent), some college but no degree (16 percent), associate\u2019s or bachelor\u2019s degree (48 percent), graduate degree (32 percent)\n- Career level: entry-level (10 percent), experienced (58 percent), manager or senior-level manager (32 percent)\nReaders, where are you most productive?

The game was made by Paradox Entertainment , a games developer based in Stockholm , capital of Sweden , published by Strategy First , and was first released in 2002 . The MOC has established an imported game products censorship committee in an effort to step up censorship on the content of online games . The committee regulates that online games with content violating basic principles of the Constitution , threatening China 's national unity , sovereignty and territorial integrity will be banned from importing . Online games with content threatening state security , damaging the nation 's dignity , disturbing social order and infringing on other 's legitimate rights will also be prohibited .

The SPPA in early 2003 banned a US - made computer game , \" Command and Conquer Generals : Zero Hour Expansion \" , also for smearing the image of China and the Chinese army . The MOC said that all foreign online games must accept content examination by the ministry before they enter the Chinese market .

Equipment malfunction cannot be cited as a reason for non-payment of installments. Often, the lessor is only involved with the fiscal aspects of the project and plays no role in connection with the equipment itself. There are cases where the lessor does not even come in direct contact with the equipment earmarked for lease. In fact, in many instances, the lessor buys the equipment as requested by the would-be lessee and then hands it over after the signing of the hell or high water contract. As such, any defects that might affect the equipment after this handover would be deemed as liabilities to be shouldered by the lessee rather than the lessor Issues such as manufacturing defects will have to be settled between the lessee and the manufacturer. In several instances, lessees have moved court attempting to evade hell or high water contracts or leases by asserting that the lessor or vendor have fraudulently lured them into what they have now come to perceive as a dubious arrangement. Often times, the lessor is accused of inducing the lessee into a hell or high water contract by deliberately misrepresenting facts about the condition of equipment leased. Hell or high water contracts are most visible during venture finance dealings, takeovers and high-yield bonds and indentures. Hell or high water clauses in takeover deals not only make it mandatory for soon-to-be lessees to facilitate uninterrupted payments but also make it obligatory for them to assume responsibility for any future divestments or lawsuits that might emerge from antitrust laws being sanctioned against the property or equipment. Naturally, in several cases, the existence of such hell or high water clauses in agreements prove to be a formidable deterrent for prospective buyers to opt out of the arrangement.\nAcademic Research on Hell or High Water Contracts\n- Finance LeaseHellorHigh Water Clauseand Third Party Beneficiary Theory in Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code, Breslauer, P.

The decision to create a new category spotlighting an often-overlooked type of book is consistent with the general tone of the National Book Awards for the past few years . Under the leadership of executive director Lisa Lucas , the National Book Awards have made a point of using their platform to elevate and highlight great books from small presses that might be otherwise ignored . So while this year 's fiction nominees include Lauren Groff 's much - discussed short story collection Florida , they also include books from Soho Press ( Brandon Hobson 's Where the Dead Sit Talking ) and Graywolf ( Jamel Brinkley 's A Lucky Man ) . You can find the full list of this year 's finalists below . The winners will be announced on November 14 .

Upon completion , be sure to read the note in the black box at the end of the article ! ) While on a recent quick vacation in New Orleans , Paul McCartney let his guard down and admitted what some Beatles fans have suspected for years . He confirmed that the \u201c Paul is dead \u201d clues found in several Beatles album covers and songs were deliberately planted by the group as part of an elaborate scheme dating back to the summer of 1966 . According to McCartney , the plan was formulated by manager Brian Epstein . \u201c Brian dropped by the studio to hear the playback of our latest single , ' Paperback Writer . ' He did n't like it one bit . ' Not a love song , ' he said . He was concerned that the press and our fans would n't get it . He told us , ' People want love songs . They wo n't spend money for a song about a novel writer . You boys are gonna blow it with this one . ' But by this time , we were running the show , not Brian . We insisted that ' Paperback Writer ' would be our next single and told him that the song represented the new direction our songwriting was going in . \u201d When contacted in London , former Beatles press agent Tony Barrow confirmed Brian 's concerns . \u201c Brian was into traditional love songs . He had told Paul to come up with another ' Yesterday ' or ' Michelle ' for the next single . Imagine his shock when he heard ' Paperback Writer ' and ' Rain . ' Not only were they not love songs , but they were so loud ! We did n't know it at the time , but the Beatles had recorded the first heavy metal single . Not exactly ' Till There Was You ' or ' A Taste Of Honey . ' I was worried , too . I wondered , ' Had the boys gone too far this time ? ' \u201d Brian became even more concerned when he imagined an album full of unconventional songs . While a fan might take a chance on a single , an album purchase was a big thing in those days . Due to its higher price , youngsters , particularly those in the U.K. , were very careful about buying albums . That is why the Beatles often issued an EP from an album containing four of its best tracks . So Brian came up with a plan to help sell albums in the event he was right about the dangerous new direction the group was heading in . Paul explained , \u201c When I told him our future albums would be dominated by songs about interesting people and places , his heart sank . He did n't think people would buy such albums and came up with this great idea to push sales in the event he was right and we were wrong . The idea was that we would plant clues in our songs and album covers that one of us had died in a car wreck . If after a few albums , our records were n't selling well , we 'd leak out word about the clues and let our fans and the press take over . People would buy the albums to see and hear the clues . We thought , ' Wow , that 's an incredible idea ! ' We realized it would be great fun to have all those clues sitting there undiscovered until people started going nuts looking for them all . \u201d Tony Barrow also thought the plan was brilliant . \u201c Nothing re-energizes a singer 's career like his death . Do you really think Buddy Holly would have been so famous had he not died in that plane crash ? Same for Richie Valens and certainly that one - hit wonder Big Bopper with his ' Chantilly Lace ' song . And how about Otis Redding ? He never had a number one hit till after he died in a plane crash . The fact that Brian came up with a car crash shows his genius . Airplane crashes were the norm . \u201d Having sold the group on the idea , the Beatles had to decide which one of them was to \u201c die . \u201d Brian wanted the victim to be Ringo because he was the most popular Beatle in the all - important U.S. market , but the drummer wanted nothing to do with it . Tony Barrow recalls , \u201c Ringo flat out refused to be the one . He said , ' Being painted red in a movie is one thing , but pretending to be dead 's another . I 'm superstitious . Those clues might make it happen . ' Brian was disappointed because he knew Ringo was the most sympathetic Beatle . You know Ringo got more mail from America than the other members of the group combined . \u201d [ Author 's Note : Ringo was unavailable for comment . ] After Ringo turned down the \u201c opportunity \u201d to die , the honor of being a dead Beatle was up for grabs . According to Paul , \u201c George said right away he did n't feel comfortable faking his death . But it sure got him thinking . A few days later he showed up at a session with a new song called ' The Art Of Dying . ' We did n't think it was that good a song , so we never recorded it . George later improved the lyrics and included it on his first album . \u201d Paul 's recollections are backed by the original lyrics to the song , which appear in George 's \u201c I Me Mine \u201d book . The 1966 version of the song referred to Brian Epstein , who was the mastermind behind the death clues . It contained the line \u201c Then nothing Mr. Epstein can do will keep me here with you . \u201d With Ringo and George not willing to \u201c die \u201d for the good of the group , it came down to John and Paul , with both thinking it would be fab to be \u201c dead . \u201d Paul recalls , \u201c John wanted to be the dead Beatle , but this time I did n't cave in to John like I did on the songwriter credits . I thought it should be me because I was the second most popular Beatle . Brian agreed it should be me because he was worried that once the clues became known , people might think it was a John practical joke if John was supposedly dead . But me \u2026 Brian thought , ' No one would suspect Paul for rigging his own death . They think John 's the clever one . ' So I got to die . \u201d A few days after the \u201c Paperback Writer \u201d listening session , the group was at Brian 's office when photographer Bob Whitaker dropped by with the pictures from the butcher session . Brian asked Whitaker to shoot a picture of Paul in steamer trunk to symbolize his lying dead in a coffin . Paul picks up the story . \u201c Bob thought it was too direct , so he suggested we stand the truck upwards and have me sit in it with the other standing around . That way , it would only look like I was lying in a coffin if the cover was turned sideways . Bob had Ringo place his hand on the trunk lid like he was closing the coffin . Brilliant ! Brian told us to throw some clues into our songs . Right away John came up with ' I 'm Only Sleeping , ' as if ' Paul is n't dead , he 's only sleeping . ' Pretty subtle . Most people missed that clue , and that was one of the first ! \u201d The \u201c coffin trunk \u201d photo was sent to Capitol to serve as the cover for the American album \u201c Yesterday And Today . \u201d But when Brian saw the cover mock - up , he began having second thoughts about using the photo so early in the game . He was concerned that people might suspect Paul was dead a lot sooner than the group wanted to clues to be discovered . So Brian sent Capitol the butcher photo , knowing that it might ultimately be rejected , but at least it would deflect attention away from the provocative coffin trunk cover . The plan worked to perfection with the Butcher cover causing so much controversy that when it was \u201c replaced \u201d by the trunk cover , no one noticed it showed Paul lying in a coffin ! One of the casualties of the plan was Robert Freeman 's unused cover for \u201c Revolver . \u201d Paul explains that , \u201c For ' Revolver , ' Robert Freeman came up with a great cover image , but there was no death clue in it . I asked Klaus [ Voormann ] to do a pen and ink with a photo collage so we could throw in some clues . I had him place an image of my face in my ear . That represented a ' beetle ' crawling out of the ear of my buried corpse . You know , insects get into coffins and mix with the dead bodies , crawling through eye sockets , ear openings and the like . Very creepy and very subtle . And the other clue came from Klaus drawing my face in a side profile looking to the left . The others were drawn looking forward . When you turn the cover on its side , I 'm looking upward , just like I 'd appear on a morgue slab or if I were buried underground . We really were into having clues appear when you turned our covers sideways . I 'm surprised nobody caught those ' Revolver ' clues . \u201d According to Tony Barrow , there was one other clue planted on \u201c Revolver . \u201d \u201c John had this really weird song that had no title , so he called it ' Mark I . ' Later he came up with ' The Void , ' to symbolize the void left in the group by Paul 's death . Ringo thought that was too subtle , so he came up with the perfect phrase for describing the direction the group would go in if Paul really were dead . And that was ' Tomorrow Never Knows . ' Ringo was great at stuff like that . \u201d By the time the Beatles recorded \u201c Sgt. Pepper , \u201d the plan really took off . Tony Barrow recalls , \u201c Brian thought ' Tomorrow Never Knows ' was way out there . You can imagine his fear of an entire album of songs like that . He was terrified that Sgt. Pepper would be viewed as pretentious nonsense ! He told the boys to throw in a bunch of clues on that one ! \u201d The first song recorded for \u201c Sgt. Pepper \u201d was \u201c Strawberry Fields Forever , \u201d though it ended up being used as a single . At the end of the song , John was supposed to repeat \u201c I buried Paul \u201d several times , but that was too obvious , so instead he said \u201c Cranberry sauce \u201d and then slurred his words so that \u201c I buried Paul \u201d sounded like \u201c I 'm very bored . \u201d The plan worked as it took over two years before anyone realized what he was really saying . Later songs also had clues . Paul admitted that \u201c She 's Leaving Home \u201d contained the time the car wreck supposedly occurred -\u201c Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins . \u201d The line \u201c Meeting a man from the motor trade \u201d tied in the motor vehicle . And , of course , \u201c A Day In The Life \u201d was about a car crash . According to Paul , \u201c The drug references were just a smoke-screen to deflect attention away from the car crash , you know . ' He blew his mind out in a car ' could mean his head was crushed or he was doing drugs . Take your pick . \u201d The cover was full of clues : the crashing car ; Paul 's bass made of flowers ; Paul having his back to the camera on the back cover ; the hand over Paul 's head ; and the infamous \u201c O.P.D. \u201d patch on Paul 's uniform , which was McCartney 's favorite Pepper clue . \u201c We had to work hard on that one . Someone told John that in America the letters OPD stood for ' Officially Pronounced Dead . ' I remembered I had this patch with the letters \u201c OPP , \u201d which I got in Canada . I think it stands for Ontario Police Precinct or something like that . So I got the idea to put the patch on my uniform 's sleeve and shoot the picture so that the lower part of the second ' P ' would not be visible , thus making it look like ' OPD . ' I was quite pleased with the way it came out . \u201d Although the sales of \u201c Revolver \u201d and \u201c Pepper \u201d made Brian realize that the clues probably were n't needed to sell records , the group kept creating more and more clues . According to Paul , \u201c It was so neat coming up with clues that we kept doing them even thought we never thought they 'd be needed to sell albums . It was great mischievous fun ! When Brian died , we really went wild with it ! For ' Magical Mystery Tour , ' I wanted to wear a black flower on my jacket . The florist thought Alistair Taylor was nuts when he insisted they send us a black carnation . We became worried people would catch on when they saw the ' Magical Mystery Tour ' booklet because the clues were so obvious . The 4 or 5 musicians , the \u201c I was \u201d sign . But no one caught on . \u201d Paul stated that placing the clues in the songs was even more fun than the visual images . \u201c Ringo had this old song , ' Do n't Pass Me By , ' which we had refused to record for years . But I realized it could be used for a clue . I gave him the line ' You were in a car crash and you lost your hair ' And we did great stuff with backwards tape loops and mumbling . John going ' Paul is a dead man , miss him , miss him . ' \u201d Some of the clues were easy and obvious . John 's \u201c Glass Onion \u201d even told the fans what was going on with its line \u201c And here 's another clue for you all , the Walrus was Paul . \u201d But some were quite intricate . According to Paul , the toughest one was \u201c Revolution 9 . \u201d \u201c We had to come up with a phrase to go ' Number 9 ' when you played it backwards . Our plan was to have it go ' Number 9 ' on the record , but when you played it backwards it would sound like ' Paul is dead . ' When we recorded ' Paul is dead ' and played it backwards , it did n't go ' Number 9 . ' It sounded more like ' Pythagorian Theorem . ' The phrase ' Macca is dead ' sounded like ' Thermo nuclear ' when we played it backwards . We experimented for hours until Alan Parsons came up with ' Turn me on dead man . ' When we reversed the tape , it sounded like he was saying ' Number 9 , number 9 . ' So that 's how we did it . \u201d Abbey Road engineer Alan Parsons remembers the session well . \u201c We spent hours recording different phrases until I lucked into ' Turn me on dead man . ' When I played the tape backwards and heard ' Number 9 , ' well , it was one of the greatest moments of my life ! We were all sworn to secrecy about the clues , but now that Paul 's let the cat out the bag , I can talk about it . I later recorded my own song about looking for clues , ' Eye In The Sky . ' \u201d The last batch of clues were planted on the album cover to \u201c Abbey Road , \u201d which was designed by Paul . McCartney came up with the idea to stage his own funeral . George , in the role of the grave digger , dressed in work clothes . Ringo , the funeral director , wore a black suit . John , the angel , wore white . Paul was barefoot , as it is the custom in several cultures to bury people without their shoes . In a subtle touch , the left- handed McCartney held a cigarette in his right hand . This was to imply that the Paul who had been with the group since mid-1966 was a right - handed imposter . Paul recalls the other major \u201c Abbey Road \u201d clue with fondness . \u201c I've always liked puns , so I wanted to have a Volkswagon Beetle represent me . Alistair Taylor arranged for a friend of his to park his VW Beetle on the street by the studio . Alistair and I placed a special license tag we had made the night before on the car . It said ' 28 IF , ' meaning that I would have been 28 if I had lived . Unfortunately , I out -thought myself on that one . I was only 27 at the time , but I told Alistair to paint it as 28 because I did n't think \u201c Abbey Road \u201d would come out until I was 28 . That 's because I was sure that the \u201c Get Back \u201d album would come out first . By the time we decided to put out \u201c Abbey Road \u201d first , I had forgotten about that clue , so we did n't have the picture altered to have the tag read ' 27 IF . ' \u201d When John told the others he was quitting the group , Paul began thinking it was time to expose the clues . \u201c I was always nervous before a record came out , you know . Would people like it ? And , in this case , what if word leaked out that John had quit ? We were all worried that the album would bomb , and when word spread that John was out , we 'd be forgotten . No one would buy our latest LP or our old records . The clincher was a pair of bad reviews published in ' The New York Times ' and ' Rolling Stone . ' I thought , oh sh*t , no one likes the long medley on side two . So I had Mal [ Evans ] go to Detroit and tell some college kids about the clues . One of the guys phoned in some of the clues to a radio station there . That was all it took . \u201d Once people started looking for clues , they were easy to spot . The American press was fascinated with the story . Brian 's plan worked to perfection . Not only did sales for \u201c Abbey Road \u201d take off , but people began buying \u201c Sgt. Pepper , \u201d \u201c Magical Mystery Tour \u201d and \u201c The White Album \u201d to see and hear the clues . Paul hid away at his farm in Scotland to further fuel the hoax . When a reported from \u201c Life \u201d magazine finally caught up with him , Paul dead - panned , \u201c If I were dead , I 'd be the last to know . \u201d The Beatles and their inner circle kept the clue caper a secret for over thirty years . Not only do we now know that the Beatles deliberately planted the clues , but we also know that it was part of a brilliant marketing plan formulated by manager Brian Epstein back in 1966 . As for why Paul finally revealed the secrets behind the scheme , we may never know if it was an accidental slip up on his part or a plan to reignite sales of the Beatles catalog . Bruce Spizer is a well - know Beatles author and historian who has not only written a series of critically acclaimed books on the group 's American records , but also has been known to tell a tall tale or two for April Fool 's Day .

The history of free agency has proven that not all signings go as planned , but which move has been the worst of the last 10 years ? One continues to come up with our experts . - Jason La Canfora NFL Network One Redskins class takes the cake The Washington Redskins have turned this into an art . They have melded gratuitous and inexact overspending in ways few others would have even considered , and they 've done it with stunning regularity . < table align= \" right \" width = \" 315 px \" > < tbody > < tr> < td > < content:static src= \" \/ widgets\/custom\/packages\/latest_debates.html \" ><\/content:static > <\/td > <\/ tr> < \/ tbody > < \/ table > So , it becomes awfully hard to pick one ( Jeff George , Deion Sanders , Albert Haynesworth ? ) . So I 'm instead going to include one massively unproductive , but quite pricey , free - agent class of 2005 . Coming off a rare playoff appearance , then - coach [ Joe Gibbs ] ( \/ player \/ joegibbs\/2508072\/profile ) decided to change the offense again and welcome in another big group of players that included receivers Antwaan Randle El and Brandon Lloyd , defensive end [ Andre Carter ] ( \/ player \/ andrecarter \/2504738 \/ profile ) , safety Adam Archuleta , quarterback Todd Collins , and tight end Christian Fauria . The limos were lined up at [ Redskins ] ( \/ teams\/washingtonredskins\/profile?team= WAS ) Park for the wining and dining . Archuleta , relegated to the personal protector on the punt team within weeks , became the NFL 's highest - paid safety . The enigmatic Lloyd and Randle El were paid like starting receivers , but neither performed like one . Fauria and Collins rarely played . Carter stuck around for several years with sporadic production . A free - agent class that was supposed to lift the franchise to a Super Bowl instead became an albatross from a salary cap and roster standpoint , and came to symbolize the kind of ineffectiveness of the Redskins ' approach to free agency . - Vic Carucci NFL.com Such an obvious answer Can there be another answer besides the Redskins ' signing of Albert Haynesworth to a seven-year , $ 100 million contract in 2009 ? That has to rank as one of the all - time worst investments in NFL history . Haynesworth has been a colossal bust on the field . His disconnect with coach Mike Shanahan , the rest of the Redskins ' coaching staff , and his teammates for a variety of reasons ( but most notably his hatred of the team 's switch from a 4 - 3 to a 3 - 4 scheme in 2010 ) has made him nothing but a massive nuisance in the locker room . Once regarded as arguably the NFL 's most dominant defender when he was with the Tennessee Titans , Haynesworth now draws far more attention for his habit of running afoul of the law than he does for playing football . - Bucky Brooks NFL.com ' The poster boy for free - agent failures ' Albert Haynesworth is easily the worst free - agent signing over the past 10 years . He was signed to a monster contract worth $ 100 million -- with $ 41 million guaranteed -- to lead the Redskins back into contention , but he has provided little production or leadership since his arrival . He has repeatedly feuded with players and coaches over his role , and his lack of effort after landing a huge paycheck has made him the poster boy for free - agent failures . - Steve Wyche NFL.com A bad move for more than one reason This might seem pretty obvious , but it 's Albert Haynesworth . My justification is that this was a double - sided bad move . This was n't an awful signing in terms of Haynesworth dismantling a franchise and ruining things for years . He did n't play up to his potential , but he did n't wreck the team . It was already unstable when he arrived . This was bad because Washington , once again , way overpaid a player most teams knew could be a problem once he got paid . Heck , I did n't have to do a massive background check to know he was n't a great teammate . I simply talked to his teammates in Tennessee . I would have thought Washington would have at least done that amount of due diligence . The Redskins played themselves , especially since they 've already paid him $ 41 million . The signing is also a disaster from Haynesworth 's side . Sure , he got paid . But he made things a lot tougher for his peers , especially on the defensive line , to ever get the type of free - agent deal he received . Players have told me as much , which is why he is n't the most popular guy among his peers . - Pat Kirwan NFL.com The guy who set back free agency There are inevitably a number of players who get paid tons of money to leave one team and join another , with the teams signing them hopeful of gaining the same production that earned these players big contracts . In my mind , the worst move of the last 10 years has to be the Redskins deciding to pay Albert Haynesworth , whose behavior and lack of effort set back free agency and ultimately scared many teams about dropping that kind of money ( $ 100 million , with $ 41 million guaranteed ) on a player . I wonder how many free agents looking for a big pay day wo n't see big money because of Haynesworth . He clearly looks like a guy who wanted a big deal with little intention to live up to the contract and , even worse , respect his new teammates . - Albert Breer NFL Network Ultimate con job I 'd like to get creative here , but is it possible to not go Haynesworth ? He 's been in Washington two years , has collected $ 41 million , quit on two different coaches , and his signature moment in burgundy and gold came lying flat on his belly seemingly without a pulse as Michael Vick danced around and through the Redskins ' pass rush to buy time and throw a touchdown pass . But maybe the worst thing about it ? The ' Skins should 've seen it coming . The Titans were more than happy to franchise Haynesworth in 2008 and guarantee they would n't do it again , knowing they had a perfect - storm scenario -- the big man in a contract drive with perhaps the only man who could drive him , Jim Washburn , pushing the buttons . The result : Tennessee went 13 - 3 with Haynesworth at his best , and Washington got conned . Badly . Then , Mike Shanahan had to live with Vinny Cerrato 's mistake , which helped turn his first year in D.C. into a circus . Safe to say that the league 's first $ 100 million defender was n't worth the freight , or the trouble ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Among those men who reassured us , despite all the uncertainty associated with a war we never sought but were burdened with by Pakistan , were K.M. Shehabuddin and Amjadul Haq . They were young , they were junior diplomats at the Pakistan High Commission in Delhi when the Pakistan occupation army launched its genocide in what was then East Pakistan . Neither they nor the seventy five million people of Bangladesh knew at the time if or when Bangladesh would become a free state . And yet Shehabuddin and Haq did the unimaginable : they repudiated Pakistan on April 6 , 1971 . Go back in time . Your sense of history will inform you that when Shehabuddin and Haq revolted , the Mujibnagar government - in - exile had not yet taken shape . No one knew where Tajuddin Ahmed was at that point . There was simply no trace of Syed Nazrul Islam or Mansoor Ali or A.H.M Quamruzzaman . For that matter , the world did not know if Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had made his way out of Dhaka or had been abducted by the Pakistan army . At a time when reports of widespread atrocities in Bangladesh were filtering out to the outside world , it was quite possible that Bangabandhu was dead , at the hands of the Pakistan army . This morning , therefore , it is our moral responsibility to salute K.M. Shehabuddin and Amjadul Haq for the sheer bravery they demonstrated in early April 1971 . Their act opened a window . They informed the world that Bangladesh , even as it waited for its parameters to take shape , was preparing to go on a diplomatic offensive . That battle was carried many miles further when Hossain Ali , Pakistan 's deputy high commissioner in Calcutta , turned his back on Pakistan on April 18 , a day after the formation of the Mujibnagar government , and with 65 Bengali officers and employees of the mission , switched allegiance to Bangladesh . Forty years on , it is our singular pride to recall that seminal moment when Hossain Ali formally hoisted the Bangladesh flag in Calcutta and proceeded forth along the route set on April 6 by Shehabuddin and Amjadul Haq . All these years after what was truly a momentous year for us , it is time to enlighten the young as it is time to remind those of our generation suffering from selective amnesia of the superhuman efforts expended by Bengali warriors on various fronts toward highlighting the national struggle for freedom before the world . Bengali diplomats played a pivotal role in that struggle . You admire their sense of patriotism . More than that , you keep reminding yourself of the grave risks they put themselves and their families to by rejecting the state of Pakistan at a time when none of us was sure when freedom would dawn or if it would dawn at all . Their larger familiesparents , siblings and otherswere in the occupied land and could easily be put through horrible suffering by Pakistan 's soldiers . Human frailties are natural . All too often , it is the probable consequences of our actions which stay our hand . And we do not go forth into the region of the unknown . But these brave Bengali diplomats plunged into the dark in their sheer belief that at the end of it all there surely was light somewhere . As Pakistan 's vice consul in New York , A.H. Mahmood Ali could have held himself back from going over to Bangladesh . He did not do that . On April 25 , he quit the Pakistan foreign service and allied himself with the Bangladesh cause . Do not forget that Ali , Shehabuddin , Haq and Hossain Ali were all young . Note too the idealism in them , the same that spurred A.M.A. Muhith , economic counselor at Pakistan 's embassy in Washington , into rebellion against Pakistan on 30 June . When men like Muhith spurned Pakistan , the world paid attention . And , yes , the world paid greater attention when , on August 1 , Mohiuddin Ahmed , then with the Pakistan High Commission in London , delivered a riveting speech at Trafalgar Square to tell people around the world why Bangladesh was waging war to be free . K.M. Shehabuddin , having performed well as Bangladesh 's diplomat at various critical points on the globe , has done a fine job of recording the history of our diplomatic struggle for freedom in 1971 . If you have not gone through There and Back Again : A Diplomat 's Tale ( published by The University Press in 2006 ) , it is time you did . For it speaks of the calculated dangers men like Abul Fateh , Pakistan 's ambassador in Iraq , plunged into through their rejection of Pakistan . Fateh went over to Bangladesh on August 21 . Ten days earlier the Pakistani junta had placed Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on trial in camera before a military tribunal . M.M. Rezaul Karim , who would in January 1972 receive a free Bangabandhu in London , declared his solidarity with Bangladesh on October 7 . One of the more momentous happenings in the fledgling country 's diplomacy occurred on August 4 when Enayet Karim , Shah A.M.S. Kibria , Abu Rushd Matinuddin , Syed Moazzem Ali , Ataur Rahman Chowdhury , A.M. Sharful Alam and Sheikh Rustam Ali walked out of the Pakistan mission in Washington and joined the Bangladesh movement . S.A. Karim left Pakistan 's UN mission and strode over to Bangladesh . On 14 September , K.K. Panni , ambassador to the Philippines , repudiated Pakistan . Pakistan 's ambassador to Argentina , Abdul Momin , followed suit about a month later , on October 11 . On October 3 , Mustafizur Rahman deserted Pakistan 's mission in Kathmandu ; Humayun Rashid Chowdhury , based in Delhi , went over to the Bangladesh camp on October 4 . Waliur Rahman did so on November 2 . These men blazed a trail . . . in all - encompassing darkness ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Rond 1920 werd Springendal aangekocht door de Enschedese textielbaron Jannink . Hij gaf het al eeuwenoude landbouwgebied het aanzicht van een landgoed met veel Engelse kenmerken . De middeleeuwse essen ( bolakkers die doorbemesting steeds hoger werden ) zijn , vriendelijk omzoomd door bomen , opgenomen in het geheel . Ook liggen er een aantal fantastische Twentse boerderijen . Springendal heeft een structuur van lanen en van water . Naast de monumentale Mosbeeklaan waarop een aantal zijlanen uitkomen wordt het karakter van het landgoed bepaald door bronnen en beken .

Accused by the Nazis of setting the Reichstag fire in 1933 , he successfully defended himself at the Leipzig Trial and thereby became an international symbol of resistance to Nazism . Stalin appointed him head of the Communist International ( Comintern ) in 1935 , and he held this position until the Comintern 's dissolution in 1943 . After the end of World War II , Dimitrov returned to Bulgaria and became its first communist premier . During the years between 1933 and his death in 1949 , Dimitrov kept a diary that described his tumultuous career and revealed much about the inner working of the international communist organizations , the opinions and actions of the Soviet leadership , and the Soviet Union 's role in shaping the postwar Eastern Europe . This document , edited and introduced by historian Ivo Banac , is available in English in this volume .

The article , by McCandlish Phillips , detailed in an almost anthropological way the Harlem of 1966 to Times readers . \u201c A curtain of fear , about as forbidding as a wall of brick , has made the black ghetto almost psychologically impenetrable to the white man \u2014 at a time when many in the ghetto sense that it needs the white man to help it save itself from a kind of psychological secession from a white society , \u201d Mr. Phillips wrote . The article went on to note that many \u201c Negroes protest that white people see Harlem in caricature , \u201d but at the same time it stated \u2014 citing no authority \u2014 that thousands of children had shoes only for Sunday or none at all . Another Times finding was that \u201c a surprising number \u201d of residents preferred the word black to Negro , and some are turning to the study of African history and African dress . \u201d As part of the usual newspaper process , Don Hogan Charles , then 27 years old , was assigned to take the pictures \u2013 to spend a weekend documenting Harlem , where he lived . Mr. Charles was the first black photographer hired by The Times . And the images he made reveal a Harlem much different from the one portrayed in the text . Four of his photos made it into print with that article , which had probably gone through several levels of editors , and the selected images are strong if somewhat predictable : One shows a scene outside a church ; another shows men playing cards on the sidewalk . But in the hundreds of other photographs that he shot , visible in the negatives of our archives , a fuller portrait of the neighborhood and his neighbors comes into view . The residents of Don Hogan Charles 's Harlem are fully rounded people , not caricatures , symbols or subjects to be studied . He had less than two days to shoot this assignment , but his subjects share a dignity that was often missing from much reporting of the era . Though The Times was both lauded and vilified for its reporting from the front lines of the civil rights struggles in the South , there were few black journalists in the industry during those years , beyond black news outlets . Major news media coverage of New York 's black neighborhoods often resembled overseas \u201c parachute journalis m \u201d \u2014 a quick visit , conversations with a few residents on the street , with a little seasoning from outside experts . In the following decades , many newspapers , including The Times , pushed along by lawsuits , added more black , Latino , Asian and female journalists . Mr. Charles still lives in Harlem , but it is a neighborhood vastly different from the Harlem of the 1960s . Today many white people live in the neighborhood , real estate prices are soaring , and new galleries and restaurants are popping up daily . The area that was once forbidding enough to outsiders to merit a story about its realities is now one that longtime black residents worry about being able to afford . This post also appears on The Lens Blog , where a full slide show of Mr. Charles 's Harlem outtakes can be found . \u201c Harlem Today : Its Residents Seek to Dispel Whites ' Fears of Area \u201d in Times Machine"},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

All you have to do is a ) send me a banner ad , b ) tell me where you want it to link to , c ) be plausibly indie , d) not link to malware , obviously , and e) not be an asshole . i saw her too , with lasers | Submitted by costik on Thu , 11\/14\/2013 - 17:28 . | i saw her too , with lasers is the sequel to i saw her standing there , though the gameplay is somewhat different . Unlike the first game , you do not play one of the lovers , but a mad scientist who uses lasers and holograms to guide the lovers together . They are both zombies now ( the male became one at the end of the first game ) , so do not kill each other when they touch . And the \" platforming \" aspect is gone , as you do not directly control any character on screen , nor are jumps possible . casino portugal online Instead , it has much more of the feeling of a switch - controlled puzzler than an action game , though there is still a bit of a performative aspect : often , you need to switch quickly from one control to another to prevent the loss of one of the zombies . The basic scheme is similar , however : on each level , guide the lovers to one another . As with the first game , it 's a nicely tuned Flash puzzler with clean , intelligent level design , and worth your while if you like puzzle games . i saw her standing there | Submitted by costik on Tue , 11\/12\/2013 - 22:08 . | i saw her standing there is a nice little puzzle platformer with a fairly novel core mechanic and a somewhat disquieting backstory . You control the player character with WASD or the arrow keys ; \" up \" is a jump . A second ( pink , inevitably ) character moves toward you when you are sufficiently close ; your goal is to guide her to a cage ( \" I loved her but she was a zombie , so I kept her safe in a cage \" ) . Since she is a zombie , if she touches you , you die and must restart the level ; but apparently she does n't mind being caged , because a heart appears above her when you guide her there . Not that it 's really relevant to gameplay , but why is it that when games go here , the active character is always gendered male ? And while I do n't have any moral qualms about mutually consensual restraint ( in face I , ah ... better not go there ) , this is a pretty disquieting subtext from a gender political point of view . casino online The zombie- girl cannot jump , and in some levels , if you are not careful , you may guide her into a gap in a platform , causing her to die ( and of course you can mistime a jump and do likewise ) . As is typical with puzzle games , new puzzle elements are added over time , including risers , enemy zombies that can kill either of you , switchable laser barriers , and \" holograms \" of you that you can trigger to guide the zombie- girl even if you yourself are not present . There 's a tasty combination of solver 's uncertainty ( the difficulty of solving puzzles ) and performative uncertainty ( the uncertainty inherent in any skill - and - action game ) . And the story is carried in tight , evocative texts , two lines on each level , the first displayed on level load and the second when solved . Art style is minimalist , but evocative and appropriate to the game 's aesthetic . Plague Inc. The Anti-Pandemic | Submitted by costik on Wed , 11\/06\/2013 - 21:36 . | Most mobile games are little time - wasters , suitable for entertaining yourself while you wait for the bus ; few are deep , involving , and require strategic thinking . Plague Inc does , however . In Plague Inc. , you play a disease , and your victory condition is the complete extermination of humanity . Experiencing fiero because you 've just killed every man , woman , and child on the planet is ... strange , but interesting . cassino online The game comes with seven different plague types ( bacteria , virus , parasite , and so on ) ; only bacteria is unlocked at first . Each poses somewhat different difficulties ; for instance , the virus mutates frequently , which is a double - edged sword . On the one hand , it can gain new abilities without requiring you to spend \" DNA points , \" but you may also evolve in a way to alarm humanity more quickly than you 'd like . Spaceteam Immanentize the Frammistan , Mr. Sulu | Submitted by costik on Mon , 04\/08\/2013 - 19:42 . | Spaceteam is a crazy , highly creative little game that has more of the feel of a party game than a digital one . Like FTL , it 's a kind of spaceship command sim , but the games could not be more unlike each other in terms of gameplay . \u00e3\u00aa\u00e3\u00b3\u00e3\u00a9\u00e3\u00a4\u00e3\u00b3 \u00e3 \u00ab \u00e3\u00b8 \u00e3 Its for two to four players in the same physical space , each of whom needs and iOS device . You connect locally to each other , and the game begins . Each player 's screen shows a bunch of controls -- sliders , knobs , toggles , areas with two or more buttons . At the top of the screen , a command appears -- like , say , \" Set Newtonian photomist to maximum . \" But the command on your screen references a control on some other player 's screen .... So you shout \" Set Newtonian photomist to maximum ! \" and hope that whoever has the Newtonian photomist control hears you , identifies the control on their screen , and turns the know or whatnot accordingly . Strike of the Eagle Tabletop Tuesdays : Wargame Tutorial Gamebook | Submitted by sebastian sohn on Tue , 03\/26\/2013 - 01:30 . | Strike of the Eagle ( Sote ) is a modern war boardgame , incorporating many contemporary game mechanics such as hidden orders , fog -of - war , diceless combat , and a card -driven system . As with many card - driven games , a card play starts a turn and a card can be played in three different ways : for bonus unit movement , for a combat bonus , or as a historical event . Giving three different ways to play a card ensures that a player never gets a bad hand because it is up to the player to make creative combinations . scommesse online The hidden order mechanics are implemented via order discs . Each order is disc is chosen secretly and placed on top of units , then flipped and resolved simultaneously ; this way a player can bluff and be unpredictable . As with other block games , your opponent sees the blank back side of your units , creating fog -of - war ; as well , the blocks can rotate 90 degrees to track hit points , a mechanic pioneered in Quebec 1759 . Finally the combat is diceless : the combined combat strengths of attacking and defending units are compared on a chart . You can add two free randomly drawn cards to modify the combat result or pay with specific cards from your hand . Thus you can pay resources to hedge your bets or press your luck . Hotline Miami A Bit of the Old Ultraviolence | Submitted by costik on Sun , 03\/24\/2013 - 19:10 . | Hotline Miami is a brutally difficult , brutally violent , top-down brawler and shooter . With retro , 90s - style graphics , it has something of a feel of a Sega Genesis game -- not a SNES one ; Nintendo would never have let anything this violent on their platform , but Sega was edgier . migliori casino online You 're assigned your missions via mobile phone by strange people who wear animal masks and claim to know all about you , though you 're apparently amnesiac . The story , such as it is , is a somewhat surreal one , but it 's a transparently thin veneer to provide some strange context for what 's simply a game of killing everyone on each stage . You can pick up a variety of both melee weapons and firearms ; it 's possible to play it stealthily , sneaking up on enemies and dispatching them hand - to - hand , or simply to blast away . Enemies are alerted by the sound of gunfire , though . Additional weapons are unlocked over time , as are additional animal masks ; each mask provides a special power , and you can choose among them to suit your strategy . Kentucky Route Zero The Southern Gothic | Submitted by costik on Sun , 03\/24\/2013 - 17:07 . | Kentucky Route Zero is a beautiful visual novel with something of the timeless , surreal feel of Southern Gothic fiction , though without the elaborate language of Faulkner . The graphics are simple yet striking , in a twilight palette that reinforces the moody nature of the game . It 's slow moving , meditative and emotionally impactful . You play as Conway , a truck driver , who needs to make a delivery to Dogwood Drive . The people you meet tell you that you need to use Route Zero -- which does not appear to exist on any map . Magic realism at work , in other words . casino online It 's played in a point- and - click , graphic adventure kind of way , but there are no real puzzles to solve ; more , environments to explore , and characters -- well realized ones -- with whom to chat . As in hypertext fiction , the appeal is in the story , not the gameplay ; and the interesting moments are those of epiphany , when you understand something more about the underlying story , putting pieces together mentally . Uncertainty in GamesSubmitted by costik on Thu , 03\/07\/2013 - 14:15 . In crunch mode at work , which is why there have n't been updates here for some time . However , as of tomorrow , The MIT Press releases my book , Uncertainty in Games . There are a lot of books that attempt to provide a broad overview of the craft of game design ; I wanted instead to take a single important element and go deep on it . The central argument is that uncertainty , whether of outcome or path , is a central part of the appeal of games . I analyze a slew of very different games to unpick their sources of uncertainty , and provide some ideas for how to use an understanding of uncertainty to guide the design of innovative games . south africa online casino You can find Uncertainty in Games on Amazon here . Or , of course , order from your favorite independent book store ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

The existing structure was built after an earlier log meeting house was taken down and moved to Rising Sun to serve as a shop for a local craftsman . The brick meeting house is rectangularly shaped , and measures 45 ' - 4 \" by 30 ' . The building has a gable roof shingled with slate , and a box cornice with crown and bed molding . At each end of the meeting house are two inside end chimneys . The foundation is constructed of fieldstone and the brickwork is laid in American bond . The 9\/6 windows have paneled shutters and the doors have triangular pediments over them . All the exterior trim is plain and painted white . Only one door has a latch , the others are secured by wooden bars across them on the inside of the building . The shutters , doors , frames , windows ( including sash and much of the glass ) , as well as the crown molding , are original . A graveyard extends to the east of the meeting house and is surrounded by a cast iron fence . It contains a few 18th century Quaker grave markers and a Roman Row . To the north of the meeting house stood a horse shed whose outline still can be seen . This also housed the men 's privy . || Significance : The first meeting house erected on this site was a log building in 1727 . This was used until the present brick edifice was built in 1811 . West Nottingham Friends Meeting together with East Nottingham Meeting at Brick Meeting House , Calvert , formed a single congregation , known since 1730 as Nottingham Monthly Meeting . The monthly business meetings were held alternately at this meeting house and at Brick Meeting House . In 1778 Nottingham Monthly Meeting was held here continuously due to the occupation of Brick Meeting House by a detachment of General Smallwood 's troops . The original log building was used as a shop , and then a stable . Some pieces of this wood structure are in the possession of Brick Meeting House . In the cemetery there are several 18th century Quaker grave markers , a rare survival . It also contains a Roman Row , which served as a graveyard for Roman Catholics who found it a most convenient place for burial . Several cousins of Abraham Lincoln are buried in the cemetery . West Nottingham Meeting House is representative of the meeting houses built by the Society of Friends in the late 18th and first half of the 19th centuries in this part of the country . It exhibits the unusual two entrances , one for women and one for men , and sliding panels to divide the interior space in half , as well as the raised \" Elder 's Benches . \" |"},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Conventional warfare \u2014 clashes between large military forces \u2014 defined twentieth - century power . But today , facing dominant US conventional and nuclear capabilities , the U.S. 's principal adversaries , Russia , China , and Iran , have adopted a different style of competition . Cyber attacks , covert action , proxy conflicts , information and disinformation campaigns , espionage , and economic coercion \u2014 these are the tools of irregular warfare , which will increasingly reshape international politics . In short , the future of warfare is likely to be closer to the Chinese general Sun Tzu than to the Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

We find him today , 13 months later as the arrow of time flies , in the same story \u2014 on the other end of the gun-barrel . At around 4 o'clock this afternoon , a stunning attempt on the monarch took place as he flew back to Morocco from France . The king 's 727 was attacked by F-5 fighters of the Moroccan Air Force , surviving , it is said , when the quick - thinking king himself took the radio , pretended to be a flight engineer , and informed the attacking fighters that the pilots were dead and the king mortally wounded . The ruse tricked the attacking pilots into allowing the crippled plane to make its landing in Rabat ; they returned too late to strafe the airfield when they realized their mistake . This quashed coup was swiftly laid at the door of Oufkir , the powerful Defence Minister . Oufkir was declared to have committed suicide late this night , or else in the small hours of August 17 ; this still - standing official explanation has always had its doubters , with more extravagant versions implicating the offended sovereign himself in dealing out the punishment . Probably not , but here 's foreign correspondent Stephen O. Douglas 's reconstruction in Morocco Under King Hassan : [ Interior Minister Mohamed ] Benhima said that when Oufkir arrived at the Skhirat palace at 11 p.m. he was met in an anteroom by General Mawlay Hafid and Colonel Dlimi , and when he realised that the king knew he had masterminded the plot he pulled out a revolver saying , ' I know what to expect . ' Benhima added , ' The two witnesses tried to stop him . In the struggle he fired three shots , one wounding him in the chest , the second I do n't know where , but the third was the most fatal . ' He said this was ' the truthful and authentic version ' . ' General Oufkir committed suicide . He was not killed . It has been asked if it was a suicide of loyalty or a suicide of treason . Well then , I am authorised to tell you , to certify that since 1 p.m. today , and considering the elements of inquiry we have in our possession , I can affirm that it was a suicide of treason and not a suicide of loyalty , ' Benhima said . Later at the same news conference , Benhima indicated he was just as astonished as most of the journalists . He said he and Oufkir were ' great friends . We appreciated each other very much and had confidence in each other . We had a common denominator : our loyalty , and I think we wore the same decoration , given to us on the same day for the same reasons . He was a great patriot , a great minister . As I just told one of your colleagues , I cannot figure how he could have done what he did . But he is one of the most attractive people I have known , and what I have said about him today is painful to me , but the truth had to be told . ' I learned later that during the fatal night a military ambulance took Oufkir 's blood - stained body back to his Souissi house where it was placed on the floor of a playroom . His wife Fatima was away on vacation on the Mediterranean coast and there were very few people in the house . They found Oufkir had four bullet wounds , three in the back and the fourth having gone through the nape of his neck and out through his left eye , shattering his glasses , the coup de grace . Suddenly someone decided it was a mistake to send the corpse back to his family and it was hastily retrieved the same night . Thus evidence that he may have been ' suicided ' disappeared . Hassan somehow escaped the day with his crown , but with two attempts to overthrow him over the previous 13 months and a need to purge the many unreliable Oufkir loyalists in the armed forces \u2014 well , as the London Times put it ( Aug. 22 , 1972 ) , \u201c short of his incredible good fortune there is little else that can be cited in real terms to guarantee the perpetuation of his rule . \u201d You could have made good coin wagering informed observers of the time that Hassan would live and reign another 27 years and be internationally saluted at his peaceful death at age 70 .

Infantry Battalions . Became part of the Australian Regular Army in 1947 , subsequently forming the nucleus of HQ 1st Independent Infantry Brigade Group . Later became the 1st , 2nd & 3rd battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment On March 31st , 192 1 , the eighty eight infantry battalions , five pioneer battalions , and affiliated Senior Cadet battalions , of the Citizen Military Forces were reorganized to form sixty infantry battalions , each carrying the designation of the former sixty active infantry battalions of the old AIF . In 1927 they were granted the battle honours of those AIF battalions , and since the end of the Second World have carried the battle honours awarded to 2nd AIF infantry battalions . One battalion was disbanded in 1925 , another in 1926 , and a further five in 1929 . Further reductions were made from 1930 by linking pairs of battalions , and the number of active units fluctuated between forty four in 1930 and fifty eight in 1941 , a 61st Battalion having been formed in 1938 . The 62nd Battalion was raised at the end of 1942 , however reductions in the number of active CMF battalions had begun in August 1942 , and by the end of the Second World War only thirty two battalions remained , the majority of which had served overseas and been reclassified as ( AIF ) . The 63rd and 64th Battalions were raised in late 1945 , but all battalions had been disbanded by mid 1946 . A total of thirty one of these units were re-raised from 1948 , however they were reduced in 1960 with the introduction of the regimental system , and currently only fourteen battalions and one regional surveillance unit exist with links to those original sixty of 1921 .

There is one major omission , however . Democide in China during the Sino -Japanese War that begun in 1937 , and merged with WWII in December 1941 , is excluded . This democide has been separately calculated in Rummel ( 1994 ) , and only the total derived there is given in the table ( line 386 ) in calculating the overall democide . The first part of the table ( lines 2 to 42 ) calculates the number of Japanese that died in Japanese wars , 1937 to 1945 . This amounted to 1,771,000 to 3,187,000 Japanese , most likely 2,521,000 ( line 42 ) . Of this number , 672,000 probably were civilians ( line 32 ) , virtually all killed in American air raids ( including the two atomic bombs ) . The first democide I consider is against prisoners of war and interned civilians ( lines 45 to 93 ) . Most of these figures are official , and were presented at the Tokyo War Crimes Trial . The overall number of POWs and internees killed was about 138,000 ( line 93 ) . Since this is largely based on official figures released shortly after the war , I give no high and low . For nations releasing figures on both the total number of POWs captured and the number dying in Japanese captivity , the POW death rate averaged nearly 29 percent . The table next lists estimates of the total Asian forced laborers who died from Japanese maltreatment . The most notorious case of indifference to the health and welfare of prisoners and forced laborers was the building of the Burma - Thailand railroad in 1942 to 1943 . Estimates of those killed , including POWs , are given ( lines 97 to 104 ) in the table . I already included these POW deaths under the POW total ( line 93 ) . As for Asian forced laborers working on the railroad , 30,000 to 100,000 died , probably 60,000 ( line 105 ) . I also list forced labor deaths for specific countries , beginning with Indonesia ( Dutch East Indies , at the time ) . How many Indonesian forced laborers were actually conscripted by the Japanese is unknown . Estimates run as high as 1,500,000 ( line 110a ) ; even more speculative is the death toll . This varies in the sources from 200,000 to 1,430,000 deaths , with perhaps the most likely figure being 300,000 ( the figure \" accepted \" by the United Nations -- line 114 ) . Information on Korean deaths under Japanese occupation is difficult to uncover ( Korea was not invited to participate in the War Crimes Trial ) . We do know that 5,400,000 Koreans were conscripted for labor beginning in 1939 ( line 119 ) , but how many died can only be roughly estimated . Apparently Koreans were better treated than were laborers from other countries , but still their work hours , food and medical care were such that large numbers died ( even Japanese coolies forced to work in other countries were so maltreated that many died ) . This is clear from the 60,000 Korean laborers that died in Japan out of the near 670,000 that were brought there in the years 1939 to 1945 ( line 119a ) . To estimate what the total Korean death toll might be , I give the forced labor death rates for Koreans and Chinese in Japan and forced laborers from or in Indonesia ( lines 119 b - 121 ) . With these as the upper bounds , my reading of Korean history for this period suggests a possible range in the Korean death rate of 5 to 15 percent , with a mid-estimate of 7 percent . These should be conservative rates , given that near 9 percent died in Japan where work conditions can be assumed better than in Korea or Manchuria ; and that the rates are much less than half those for China and Indonesia . Even at these low rates , however , the forced labor toll for Korea comes to 270,000 to 810,000 dead in seven years . Data is equally sparse for Manchuria . From diverse sources it is clear that Japan conscripted over a 1,000,000 forced laborers from Manchuria , which is thereby made the low ( line 126 ) ; but how many died is unknown . I use the same approach here as for Korea , assuming the death rate for Manchurian laborers to be closer to that for the Chinese forced to labor in Japan ( line 127 ) . This gives ( line 128 ) a probably conservative range of 100,000 to 200,000 Manchurian dead over seven years . For the Burma - Thailand railroad , and for Indonesia , Korea , and Manchuria , 600,000 to 1,610,000 Asian forced laborers died ( line 131 ) . Note that this is probably very conservative , even were some of the estimates too high for a few of the countries included . No figures , even a basis for rough estimates , are available in the sources for Malaysia , Indochina , and Burma ( except for those dying while working on the Burma - Thailand railroad ) . Yet , based on Japanese behavior in other countries , many forced laborers from these countries also must have died elsewhere . The table next presents estimates on Japanese massacres and atrocities in occupied countries and territories . I make two listings of these . The first ( lines 134 - 217 ) is of those countries or territories for which no total or subtotal is available or can be calculated ; the second ( lines 228 - 289 ) is of countries and places for which a country total can be determined . Considering now the first list , in most cases the existence of a massacre was alleged , without any estimate of the number killed being given . Where such estimates were available , they add up to 8,089 killed ( line 223 ) , or an average slightly over 1,300 per incident . A problem is how to handle the forty - three massacres for which there is a question mark ( line 221 ) . For the six massacres in this list for which there are estimates , the average is 1,348 killed . In China , where many more reports of the number massacred were available , the average killed for all the low estimates was 800 . Turning to the next list , there is enough information given about the countries or territories included here for me to a country - by - country estimate of those killed . The first territory tabulated is Indochina ( lines 229- 240 ) . From information ( line 244 ) that 5.5 percent of the European population died we can estimate for the French population ( lines 242 - 243 ) at that time that at least 1,320 were killed . Similarly , from the Indochinese ( Vietnamese , Laotians , and Cambodians ) population ( lines 247 and 248 ) and a report that 2.5 percent died , we get a high estimate of 575,000 dead ( line 250 ) . This is a very large number , and appears to grossly exaggerated the total massacred ( and is thus made a high ) . Many may have died from other causes , such as local famines , for which the Japanese were not wholly responsible . In the Philippines , where the Japanese were especially prone to massacre inhabitants due to the pervasive guerrilla war being waged against them , the democide rate high was almost 14 murdered per thousand by the Japanese ( line 348 ) ; for China a high of near 30 per thousand of the population in occupied territory probably were similarly killed ; From information available in the sources , there appears no special reason to believe that the Japanese treated Indochinese with greater brutality than they did the Chinese or Filipinos ; indeed , overall , they may have been much better treated than Filipinos . Accordingly , I assume the low based on the Chinese democide ( 21 percent that of the Philippines ) is that for Indochina ; I base the high on the native population dead ( line 250 ) ; and I calculate the mid-value as the average between this and the Chinese and Filipino bases . This gives ( line 250 c ) a range of 68,000 to 575,000 Indochinese killed , with a most probable estimate of 207,000 , considerably under 2.5 percent of the population . I treat Indonesia next ( lines 253 - 284 ) . Numerous massacres were reported in Indonesia , and those for which estimates of the number of people killed are available total 13,100 to 15,290 dead ( line 285 ) . Given the population of Indonesia ( line 289 ) , this estimate can be checked by calculating an overall toll based on the Japanese democide in China and the Philippines ( lines 292 and 293 ) . Moreover , we have the one estimate that a total of 4,000,000 Indonesians died in the war from all causes ( line 296 ) . Finally , adding the forced labor and massacre deaths ( line 297 ) gives a total that can be compared with these above figures . Clearly , juxtaposed to lines 292 to 296 , the total seems well in line and I thus take the estimate of massacre and atrocity deaths ( line 286 b ) as reasonable . The next territory to consider is Malaya ( lines 301 - 311 ) . The Chinese living in Malaya particularly suffered from the Japanese occupation , at least 37,000 of them being executed ( lines 301 , 302 , 304 ) . In order to get some overall figures , estimates based on the China and Philippine democide rates are given ( line 318 and 319 ) . Also included with these bases is a high of 100,000 killed given by Malayan officials . Noting this high and that the few available figures already total 38,000 killed ( line 312 ) , I consolidated these figures into a range of 55,000 to 100,000 killed , with a mid-estimate of 83,000 . Manchuria , that follows ( lines 326-329 ) , is considered separately from China . It had already been taken over and administered as a Japanese colony ( in effect ) prior to the Sino -Japanese War . Very little information is available in the sources on massacres and atrocities in the territory during the war , although the Tokyo War Crimes Trials and Japanese behavior elsewhere suggest that many such took place . As to Okinawa ( line 333 ) , we know about how many Okinawan civilians lost their lives during the American invasion of the Island , and some of these intentionally were killed by Japanese troops or ordered to commit suicide , but the democide is unknown and cannot even be guessed . On the Philippines ( lines 336 to 342 ) , better estimates than for any other territory are available . After the Japanese defeat on the Islands , special American units tried to document the massacres committed by Japanese forces and secret police . Still , different and inconsistent figures are given ( lines 336-340 ) , taking into account the number of American civilians ( line 336 ) and American and Filipino POWs ( lines 73 , and 78 - 82 ) captured and killed . Most likely this is due to the difficulty of estimating the toll of many recorded and unrecorded massacres and atrocities . In any case , a minimum of 90,000 Filipino civilians killed seems solid . No high is readily suggested , so I invoke the procedure of doubling the low and taking the mid-value as a third higher than the low ( line 343 ) . For the high and mid-value , these are prudent procedures . No information is available in the sources on Philippine forced labor , yet judging from Japanese occupation behavior elsewhere , perhaps tens , if not hundreds of thousands of such laborers must have been conscripted , many probably dying . I assume these numbers to be absorbed into the democide 's high and mid-values , while presuming that the low involves no forced labor deaths at all . All this gives a most probable democide rate of two to three Filipinos per thousand per year ( line 349 ) . Next to consider is Saipan ( line 352 ) , where an unknown number of Japanese civilians were killed by Japanese troops or ordered too commit suicide . No basis for estimating these numbers is given in the sources . Estimates of democide in Singapore 's follows ( lines 355-361 ) . The best figure is of 150,000 Asians killed by the Japanese secret police ( line 356 ) and this is made the low . I make the high twice the low , and the mid-value a third higher . If anything , this procedure may underestimate the real total . The low excludes at least 5,000 Chinese rounded up by the Japanese Army and killed in February , 1942 ( line 359 ) ; and other Army massacres undoubtedly occurred , some of which are listed in the table ( lines 355 , 357 , 358 , and 360 ) . And no forced labor deaths are included ( although some may have been picked up by the Asian toll on the Burma - Thailand railroad -- line 105 ) . Finally , there were 590 American civilian victims ( line 365 ) . Adding together all these massacre and atrocity figures ( line 369 ) gives a total of 413,000 to 841,000 killed . Here and there in the sources are hints of local Japanese caused famines in one territory or another , but only for India and Indochina are estimates of famine deaths given . That for India is blamed on Japanese policies in Burma that upset the rice supply , but there is not enough information to assume that these policies were pursued with a reckless or knowing disregard of a famine that might be produced . For Indochina , when the food supply was disrupted by US air raids and a naval blockade , the Japanese knowingly diverted to their forces rice needed by the inhabitants for survival . Without more information , however , how much of this famine to blame on the Japanese is a guess . Accordingly , a low of 25 percent responsibility is estimated ( line 378 ) , which seems prudent enough . From all the assumptions , consolidations and calculations made , the overall Japanese democide in World War II can now be estimated ( lines 381 - 384 ) , and Japanese democide in China included ( line 386 ) . This gives a total democide of 3,056,000 to 10,595,000 with a likely mid-total of 5,964,000 people killed . How credible is this range and most probable democide ? To assess this , the total population controlled by Japanese forces is first calculated ( line 400 ) , and after comparing this to one such figure ( line 401 ) given in the sources , a range of population figures is consolidated ( line 402 ) . These population figures are then used to calculate the death toll using the Chinese and Filipino democide rates as the basis ( lines 405 and 406 ) . Since totals are now being compared , these bases are calculated for the full 1937 to 1945 period . The total democide figures are reproduced below the two resulting ranges ( line 409 ) for comparison . As can be seen , the overall democide total for Japan is close to that one would get estimating it from Japan 's democide in China or the Philippines . This implies that the total democide figures are not inconsistent from one territory or country to another , but that there was a pattern of Japanese democide throughout that is captured by these results . This pattern is there regardless of the many assumptions , estimates , and calculations involved , and even taking into account that in some cases a China and Philippine bases was used to estimate a country or territory 's massacres and atrocities ( most forced labor and all POW deaths were determined independently ) . And this relative consistency lends credibility to the democide totals . With these totals I calculated ( lines 412 and 413 ) the overall and annual democide rate ( for the occupied population , at its greatest extent ) . As can be seen , nearly one out of every one - hundred people controlled by Japan was murdered , or almost three per thousand people per year . * From the pre-publisher edited manuscript of Chapter 3 in R.J.

In the Thirty Years ' War , an estimated 8,000,000 Germans were wiped out by flea- borne bubonic plague and louse - borne typhus fever . On Napoleon 's retreat from Moscow , typhus , dysentery and pneumonia killed 450,000 of the Grand Army 's 500,000 men . World War I was the first war in history in which guns were more deadly than germs . Battlefield deaths totaled 8,000,000 ; deaths from disease , 3,000,000 . Yet , despite the great achievements of medical science , disease was still a potent wartime killer . In 1914 , typhus swept through Serbia , spread to Russia , where , in four years , it killed 3,000,000 peasants . Today British and French doctors expect no epidemics of typhus , typhoid or cholera . Although there is no effective remedy for any of these diseases , all can be prevented by sanitary precautions . British soldiers are given inoculations against smallpox , tetanus , typhoid . But a titanic task faces the doctors of Germany and Central Europe . Typhus and Typhoid . Carried by the louse and the rat-flea is Rickettsia prowazeki , a tiny organism which causes the dirty pink eruptions , burning fever and wild delirium of typhus fever . Prevention is simple : \" no lice , no typhus . \" Also louse - borne is trench fever , a milder relative of typhus , which made its first appearance in World War I . Still to be tried on a mass scale are new typhus vaccines which have been produced independently by breeding Rickettsiae on chicken eggs , both by Harvard 's famed Bacteriologist Hans Zinsser and by Dr. Herald Rea Cox of the U. S. Public Health Service . About 8,000 doses of this new vaccine already have been sent to Hungary . When the Germans moved into Poland last fall , they lugged with them portable shower baths , ran farm motors to make steam for delousing Polish prisoners . Because of these thorough precautions , there has been no large - scale typhus epidemic in louse - ridden Poland , although the disease has flickered there , as it has in China , for many years . Warsaw has suffered from typhoid fever , a disease quite different from typhus , transmitted by typhoid bacilli which lodge in human excrement , food , water . Nor have the Finns been plagued with typhus . Bi-weekly steam baths are their chief protection . Dr. Herbert Alonzo Spencer of the U. S. Public Health Service , who recently spent a month traveling through Finland , believes that there is no danger of a typhoid epidemic . Influenza . Greatest plague of World War I , if not the greatest in history , was the flu epidemic of 1918 which scourged every continent , almost every inhabited island . Throughout the world , more than 20,000,000 people died of it , 550,000 of them in the U. S. Since influenza runs in cycles of some 20 years , some epidemiologists expect another great pandemic any year now . In recent months British doctors have anxiously watched flu graphs , but last week the British Medical Journal heaved a sigh of relief , announced that \" this year 's epidemic certainly does not rank among the major visitations of recent years . \" POWERED BY digg"},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

The Associated Press unveiled its preseason college football poll on Saturday , the latest rankings released to unofficially signal the countdown to kickoff . The USA Today Coaches ' Poll and SI.com 's preseason top 25 were released earlier this month . Alabama claimed the No. 1 spot in the preseason poll with 58 of the 60 possible first - place votes ( No. 2 Ohio State and No. 5 Georgia split the other two ) . Oregon , Stanford and Georgia rounded out the top five . The full AP poll is below , with first - place votes in parentheses : 1 . Alabama ( 58 ) 2 . Ohio State ( 1 ) 3 . Oregon 4 . Stanford 5 . Georgia ( 1 ) 6 . South Carolina 7 . Texas A&M 8 . Clemson 9 . Louisville 10 . Florida SI Recommends 11 . Florida State 12 . LSU 13 . Oklahoma State 14 . Notre Dame 15 . Texas 16 . Oklahoma 17 .

Illinois 16 , Mississippi 11 , Utah St. 8 , Georgia Tech 6 , Arizona 3 , Cincinnati 3 , North Carolina 3 , Penn St. 2 , BYU 1 . Notes : \u2022 Alabama is the preseason No. 1 for the fourth time in school history . The Crimson Tide 's 58 first - place votes matched Florida in 2009 for the highest percentage of first - place votes in the preseason poll 's history . Alabama , you might recall , has claimed three of the last four BCS titles and is vying to win its third straight , the first for any program . But history actually does not favor the Tide : Since the AP rankings began in 1950 , only 10 of the 63 teams who began the season No. 1 went on to win the national championship . The most recent ? USC in 2004 . \u2022 Much like the USA Today Coaches ' Poll , the SEC asserted its dominance with six teams in the AP Poll : Alabama , Georgia , South Carolina , Texas A&M , Florida and LSU . Five of the AP 's top 10 were SEC teams , which were more than all but three conferences had in the entire poll . The Big Ten and Pac - 12 each had five teams ranked , with the Big 12 landing four and the ACC two . \u2022 The AP Poll mirrored the Coaches Poll by including three teams outside the Power Five conferences : Louisville ( No. 9 ) , Notre Dame ( 14 ) and Boise State ( 19 ) . This was Louisville 's best preseason rankings in program history . The Cardinals and Broncos might become mainstays in the polls with their weak schedules : Neither team will play a game against another AP preseason top 25 team this season . \u2022 The distribution of first - place votes is intriguing . It comes as no surprise that Alabama landed the vast majority of first - place love , but an AP voter actually gave Georgia one of the other two votes for the top spot . In SI.com 's preseason top 25 , Georgia did n't even crack the top 10 , coming in at No. 12 . SI 's staff put its stock elsewhere in the SEC , ranking South Carolina ( No. 6 ) and Texas A&M ( No. 3 ) ahead of the Bulldogs . The coaches failed to have as much faith in Georgia , as well , with sixth - ranked Texas A&M and No. 2 Ohio State receiving the other first - place votes in the Coaches ' Poll . \u2022 Get ready for a battle at the top of the Pac - 12 this season . Oregon ( No. 3 ) and Stanford ( No. 4 ) represent the highest - ranked conference duo in the poll . \u2022 The AP Poll features the exact same 25 teams as the Coaches ' Poll , and 19 of them earned the same ranking . There are no changes in Nos. 15 - 25 between the two polls . Per Brett McMurphy of ESPN"},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

It 's an integral time in our day during which our bodies work to repair , recoup and prepare for the day 's work ahead . Not only is our sleep a time to unwind physically , but mentally as well . As we sleep , our body works to repair muscle and strengthen itself , though it also regulates mood and stabilises hormones and emotions . Without a great night 's sleep every night , we open our bodies to a higher risk of injury , a less happy day and far less productivity at school and work . As we learn more about sleep , it 's becoming ever clearer that it 's the ' activity ' that underpins everything in our lives . Without a proper sleep routine and good sleep hygiene , you 're really giving up a considerable portion of your life to a reduced life span , as well as reducing your levels of happiness throughout the day thanks to daytime sleepiness and potential mental health problems . From various sleep studies , it 's now clear that a poor amount of sleep has severely detrimental impacts on millions of Australian each year , as research reveals that Aussies in all age groups are not sleeping enough overall . Below we 'll take a look at some common sleeping disorders , the effects of insufficient sleep or sleep deprivation , the common symptoms associated and how companies and corporate investment in sleep are working to entice us all into a better night 's sleep . Let 's take a look at Australia 's overall sleep trends . Not Enough Sleep Studies by the Sleep Health Foundation reveal that 33 - 45 % of Australian respondents are experiencing poor sleeping patterns , which is increasing fatigue and irritability along with poor workplace performance and ability to prevent accidents . While women are the ones more likely to wake up earlier and have more difficulty sleeping , overall 8 % of adults are sleeping over 9 hours on average , and 12 % are sleeping less than 5 \u00bd hours ( Sleep Health Foundation ) . Ultimately , the results are becoming more concerning every year with a total 10 % rise in poor sleeping patterns and short sleep duration from 2010 to 2018 , and an average of three thousand lives claimed by poor sleep per year . As is revealed by various sleep studies , poor sleep or chronic lack of sleep results in an increase in everything from risk of illness , accident and early death . Factor in the issue of Australian 's getting poorer and poorer sleep and our ability to safely undertake work and daily actions like driving is significantly decreased . Sleep Disorders and Sleep Problems With insomnia continuing to be the most common sleep disorder , occurring in 23 % of women and 17 % of men ( Sleep Health Foundation ) , there are other areas where individuals struggle with sleep . This includes Sleep Apnoea , Restless Legs Syndrome , Narcolepsy , as well as more general snoring and sleepwalking problems . Current key statistics are : \u2013 APF 2017 found that Sleep apnoea prevalence in Australia ranges from 9 - 38 % based on age and gender , where it was present more in males and older individuals along with those fitting into the obesity weight level cohort . \u2013 Narcolepsy is less common , but still affects 3 million people worldwide ( Snore Australia ) , with Sleep Health Foundation reporting isolated sleep paralysis episodes affecting 15 % of the Australian Population \u2013 Sleepwalking was most commonly faced by children aged 6 - 12 years old \u2013 Loud Snoring on a regular basis was evident in 24 % of men and 17 % of women ( Sleep Health Foundation ) \u2013 MyDr ( 2019 ) reports that ' About 5 - 15 per cent of people may have trouble getting to sleep because they suffer from restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) ' How do Australians Sleep ? The way individuals sleep can affect their posture , sleep quality and physical wellbeing over time . According to the National Sleep Foundation ; \u2013 41 % of Adults frequently sleep in the Foetal Position \u2013 7 % of Adults frequently sleep on their stomach \u2013 8 % of Adults frequently sleep on their back \u2013 15 % of Adults frequently sleep on their side Therefore , the majority of sleepers opting for the foetal position where the individual is on their side with knees bent and hunched torso , which increases circulation and reduces snoring . However , the curl can create breathing difficulties and result in sorer joints . Whilst sleeping on one 's back is the healthiest option , only a small percentage of Australians are frequenting this position , which could be a contributing reason for the increase of individuals not sleeping enough . The stomach position is the worst , due to the pressures placed on the neck and back leading to more aches as well as more severe nerve problems and , of course , inadequate sleep . Other Reasons for Poor Sleep Due to the increase in technology and an ever-connected digital world , it is becoming harder for individuals to switch off before bed to get the recommended amount of sleep . The increase in screen time particularly close to sleep time can create delays in falling asleep and increased anxiety . ' Thinking about work ' was also among the highest reasons for a lack of sleep affecting 24 % of individuals ( Sleep Health Foundation ) . According to VicHealth , 44 % of people across all ages admitted to using their computers and phones before bed , which is linked directly to sleep issues . Additionally , both worrying and illness \/ physical discomfort prevented Australians from sleeping , experienced by 51 % and 27 % of Australians respectively during a three - month study by Phillips Global Sleep Survey . Physical discomfort may be due to sleeping positions and mattress comfortability . Over one - third of adults have more than four caffeinated drinks per day which can prevent their ability to wind down and sleep at the end of the day and increasing the risk of waking because of a sleep disturbance ( Sleep Health Foundation ) . Symptoms & Effects of Sleep Deprivation Common symptoms of sleep deprivation revolve around ; \u2013 Constant yawning \u2013 Sleep Inertia \u2013 Poor Concentration \u2013 Higher Irritability \u2013 Lack of Motivation \u2013 Clumsiness \u2013 Forgetfulness or Memory Issues \u2013 Increased Appetite \u2013 Obstructive Sleep Apnea Let 's take a look at these symptoms in a little more depth . Memory Issues As we sleep , our brains work around the clock to consolidate our days , make new connections and in laymen 's terms \u2014 get ready for the day ahead . A night of poor sleep wo n't only prohibit this memory consolidation , but will also impact our ability to pull on important information the following day . If you 've slept poorly the night before an exam , test or presentation at work , for example , you 're going to have a hard time pulling important information from memory and thus , be less productive and hinder your day 's work . To add , sleep studies by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine have shown us that routine poor sleep can , in fact , damage long and short term memory formation \u2014 essentially preventing us from remember important details or even forgetting entire events . Clumsiness As we all know , when we 're tired , we 're far clumsier and less are of what goes on around us \u2014 which becomes particularly troubling when we get behind the wheel of a vehicle . From data available to us \u201c drowsy driving caused 72,000 crashes and 800 deaths in the United States , \u201d alone , making it quite a severe problem . According to APG , when Australians have a bad night of sleep , it significantly decreased their brain functioning in the areas of motivation ( 43 % ) , concentration ( 35 % ) and mood ( 38 % ) . Particularly , memory issues formed , and high blood pressure was a concern for individuals lacking sleep . Moreover , 20 - 30 % of all Australian fatal crashes were a result of fatigue ( Allianz ) . Work-related accidents were also common due to the reduction in concentration and memory . When individuals are running low on sleep , their bodies may store more fat and they tend to gravitate towards unhealthy food alternatives , overall increasing the risks of obtaining type 2 diabetes . Overeating and Appetite Changes As is revealed by the Sleep Foundation , lack of sleep also greatly affects our appetite and amount we eat and at which time throughout the day . First off , there is an increase of 300 calories or roughly 1,200 k J increase in food consumption by those who have sleep habits less than ideal during the night according to the Sleep Foundation , which immediately highlights the link between appetite , weight gain and inability to lose weight when we sleep poorly . This appetite change is caused by the increased level of endocannabinoid in our body when we do n't sleep . This ' endocannabinoid ' is a lipid , which is essentially the body 's way of making us want to eat more , and enjoy what we 're eating a lot more . Acting similarly to how marijuana causes the munchies , endocannabinoid also encourages to overconsumption of food when we 're sleep-deprived . Increased Irritability Data from Harvard 's Healthy Sleep website suggests that lack of sleep also contributes to fairly considerable switches in mood \u2014 and irritability in particular . As we 're all aware , a bad night 's sleep makes us far more short - tempered , stressed and anxious than normal , and the science backs this up . The University of Pennsylvania 's study on sleep found that 4.5 hours of shut - eye caused participants to be a lot more angry , sad , stressed , exhausted and irritable than normal \u2013 showing that there was n't one particular mood generated by poor sleep , but rather an inability to regulate mood swings in all directions . On top of irritability , mental health was also considerably affected by poor sleep . In fact , the study also outlined that up to 20 per cent of those who experienced routinely poor sleep will develop major or severe depression . That said , without a sleep routine that allows for a solid eight to nine hours , the risk of depression is alarmingly high . Concentration and Performance A statistic that might make business owners or CEOs quiver is the detrimental effect on concentration and performance \u2014 and rightly so . Australians getting less than six hours of sleep per night are far less likely to be productive than their well - rested counterparts , costing businesses a tonne of money over the course of the year . Sleep researchers measuring the quantitative effects of sleep deprivation of productivity have noted that sleep-deprived participants had a very low concentration level and found it near impossible to pay attention to tasks or focus on doing one thing at a time . The impact was so severe that in some cases , the effect was outlined as simply ' confusion . ' On top of a mental slowdown , judgment making was a lot poorer as was alertness which made getting behind the wheel of a car a lot less safe than is ideal . Statistics revealed that 'at least 100,000 car crashes ' annually were as a direct result of poor sleep . Sleeping Lengths With all of the above impacts and dangers outlined , it 's important to understand the required amounts of sleep and quality levels of sleep suggested for people to get the most out of their time in bed . The recommendations of sleeping lengths change per age and do not settle until the adult age of 20 years old . The changes must be accounted for when checking if individuals are sleeping enough , especially high school students who are more prone to late nights and early mornings ; \u2013 Adults : 7 - 9 hours \u2013 Teenager : 8 - 11 hours \u2013 Child 6 - 12 : 9 - 12 hours \u2013 Child 3 - 5 : 10 - 13 hours \u2013 Child 1 - 2 years : 11 - 14 hours As we know , poor sleep and especially can have detrimental impacts on an individual 's health and without getting an in-depth look at how you 're sleeping , it can be hard to tell just how much sleep \u2014 and how much quality sleep \u2014 you 're getting each night . A majority of the Aussie population struggles to get enough sleep , due to disorders such as chronic insomnia as well as poor sleeping trends , though companies like Apple have begun to stand in to combat this with new accessories , sleep aids , software and a gamification of sleep . If individual sleep hygiene increases , including more comfortable sleeping positions , reducing screen time and attributing enough hours to sleep per night , some improvements can be made . Economic Sleep Deprivation Statistics During the 2016 - 17 financial year , a study of Australian business and the economy was undertaken with the aim of pinpointing the financial cost of poor sleep on the workforce . As we know , performance at work is worryingly poor when we 've not had enough sleep , and because of this businesses lose thousands to tens of thousands of dollars per year , which as a nation adds up to billions of dollars . The results of the study showcased that the cost was suspected to be $ 45 billion in lost value on the Aussie economy as a whole . A few insight include : - The direct cost of sleep disorder management \u2014 $ 160 million - The direct cost of conditions related to sleep disorders \u2014 $ 1.08 billion - Financial losses related to reduced productivity at work \u2014 $ 12.19 billion - Sleep - loss related to premature death cost \u2014 $ 610 million - Employee sick day or inability to work \u2014 $ 1.73 billion - Employee arrival to work , with little to no work taking place \u2014 $ 4.63 billion - Financial losses related to accidents \u2014 $ 2.48 billion - Non-financial costs related to poor well - being \u2014 $ 27.33 billion . With those insights listed , sufferers from sleep deprivation or poorly rested Australians are contributing to a significant decline in the economic growth or sustainability of the nation 's economy . The Sleep-health Economy A look at the financial implications of sleep loss above , it 's not hard to see that there 's major room for improvement , and as a result \u2013 the sleep health economy is booming with world - leading corporations such as Apple joining the game . As retailers across the globe look to cash in on the poor sleep epidemic , the industry has ballooned to $ US40 billion and has n't shown signs of wavering just yet . With everything from noise generators , high - tech CPAP machines , smart blankets and more making an appearance , there 's a lot happening to get young adults to older adults more invested in their sleep . A few of the products , services and solutions you 'll find appearing as a result of the sleep economy include : Highly-optimised Mattresses The years of poorly designed , loud and uncomfortable spring mattresses are over and mattress brands are making big changes to get the attention of their sleep-deprived core demographics . Brands like Koala , Eva and Sleeping Duck for example have taken a deep dive into the $ 8 billion mattress market to create beds that are almost entirely proprietary , significant investment has also being made into Adjustable mattresses in Australia . With custom-designed materials and accessories that improve breathability , sleep experience and promote sleep , these are some of the first companies to truly go all - in on sleep improvement . Sleep Tracking As you might 've noticed , Apple 's recently released watch OS 7 comes with built - in sleep tracking that is so myopically focused that it measures everything down to the ' micro-movements ' our bodies make as our breathing shifts when we 're in REM sleep . Not only Apple is investing in sleep either , with a tonne of sleep trackers hitting the market to quantify our hours of sleep in bed and entice us to get a good night 's sleep . A myriad of smartphone apps have also begun hitting the market to give us insight , encouragement and tips on sleeping better . Prescription Medications and Treatment It does n't come as a surprise that the sleep medication industry is booming during the sleep - loss epidemic , with treatment - based medications growing to well over a billion dollars in sales in the US this year . There are also new medications and herbal treatments hitting the market such as melatonin which are making a splash online . Statistically speaking , these treatments and medications are projected to grow their industries from $ 1 billion this year to over $ 10 billion by 2025 . A sizeable growth outlook and a good indicator of what 's to come for the future of sleep . Recap Throughout the past decade , researchers have put sleep under the microscope in Australia and across the globe to find that Australians are sleeping far worse than is ideal . Up to 45 per cent of Aussies are n't getting enough sleep , with 12 per cent getting fewer than six and even five hours per night . Our most common sleep disorder continues to be chronic insomnia , with 17 per cent of men and 23 per cent of women in Australia routinely suffering from the condition . Sleep studies have also pinpointed that a whopping 21 per cent of Aussies sleep in the foetal position , which is unideal when it comes to getting a good night 's sleep . Just 8 per cent of us sleep on our backs , which is the most ideal sleeping position for getting a quality night 's sleep . Chronic pain also continues to be an issue for Australians looking to fall asleep , with 27 per cent of sleepers highlighting that pain keeps them from falling asleep or staying asleep each night . The most common symptoms or issues associated with poor sleep include constant yawning , high irritability , clumsiness , and inability to focus and risk of overeating . Ideal sleeping lengths remain at 7 to 9 hours for adults , 8 to 11 hours for teens and between 9 and 13 hours for younger children . Infants and very young children require at least 11 hours of sleep and up to 14 hours . A fiscal analysis of the country 's economy has outlined that sleep costs Australia 's economy a considerable $ 45 billion annually .

Nor is it a painstakingly assembled retelling of his own personal history . Instead , the author describes his quiet , deeply touching story as \u201c fable -like . \u201d Set in Arthurian Britain circa 500 A.D. -- a historical period we know little about -- it follows an old married couple that hopes to restore their lost memories , as they and their neighbors seem to be suffering from a collective amnesia . Axl and Beatrice are granted permission to leave their town , and early on in their journey they encounter bloodthirsty pixies , a once - fierce dragon made weak with age , a passionate warrior who harbors a lust for vengeance , and a stubborn boatman whose route leads passengers to an Eden-like mythical land . They soon learn from a weak , old Sir Gawain ( the Green Knight , that is ) that the dragon 's enchanted breath is the source of their hazy thinking . Fantastical plot devices aside , Ishiguro would characterize his novel as an extended metaphor for the way social memory functions -- be it the way a nation tries to forget a war , or a married couple attempts to recall the details of their wanton first dates . Although he 's written about the complexities of personal memories in many of his novels , Ishiguro has never attempted to confront how memory impacts us on a social level . \" I want people to appreciate the difficulty of questions about remembering and forgetting , \" he told The Huffington Post . \" I want to insist on the complexity of human dilemmas . \" Below , Kazuo Ishiguro discusses the central themes of his latest novel , as well as his opinions on genre , Marcel Proust and the way memory is illustrated in movies : On writing a novel that -- on its surface , at least -- differs from his earlier works : My initial inclination was to carry on doing these kind of monologues , which my previous books have been . With Never Let Me Go and The Remains of the Day , you stay well within the consciousness of just one character . They turn over their memories , sometimes they 're hiding from more uncomfortable parts of their pasts . And that question of , \" When is it better to just forget things and keep them forgotten ? \" comes up over and over again as applied to just one individual . [ The Buried Giant ] is not a first - person narrative , and it takes place in a landscape I have n't previously used . Those are the two really obvious departures . And they were both very conscious decisions . I did something I 've been wanting to do for at least 15 years , which was to write a novel about that same question -- when is it better to remember , when is it better to forget -- but applied on a larger scale , to society , to a nation , to a community . I could n't keep it as a first - personal narrative . This book would n't be appropriate as something that stays within the confines of just one mind . I had to somehow have a way of portraying a kind of a community as a crucial point of its development . On collective memory and its role in war : [ The Buried Giant ] was triggered by my being here in Europe when Yugoslavia disintegrated , and during the Rwandan genocide . Both of these happened very close together in the ' 90s . And they were puzzling as they were horrifying -- how people who had lived so intimately for a generation , using each other 's babysitters for their children -- suddenly turned on each other within small villages . Neighbor had turned on neighbor , and terrible slaughters occurred . It did seem to be a case of some kind of buried memory having been deliberately resurrected so that people could feel this hatred for each other . I have n't entirely abandoned the idea of writing a novel set in one of these places . I thought if I did that , it 'd be more journalistic or historical . It would be about Yugoslavia disintegrating or about slavery in the British Empire or in America . But people would inevitably see it as being about a single issue . I feel it 's appropriate as a novelist as opposed to a nonfiction writer to take a step back and acknowledge that these are recurring patterns in the human condition . You 'll see them repeated all through history . Because I wanted to say that I 'm looking at a universal thing , and possibly an eternal thing , I really wanted to set it in a landscape that people could see I was n't literally interested in . It was largely metaphorical . And what happened in this landscape is something we can apply to recent history . I 've even thought about a novel where characters could hop from one sort of setting to another , so that we could get all these examples plus things like South Africa after apartheid and Japan after the Second World War . There probably is a novel to be written like that , where we can see a pattern emerging over and over again . Instead , I decided to write something that 's almost like a fable . On writing emotional , rather than political , novels : I 'm not making a huge effort to be accurate . There are ogres in the mist and pixies coming out of the water . I 'm not looking for any kind of clear moral , and I never do in my novels . I like to highlight some aspect of being human . I 'm not really trying to say , so do n't do this , or do that . I 'm saying , this is how it feels to me . Emotions are very important to me in a novel . On \" forgiving and forgetting \" in romantic relationships : I wanted to also apply the question of memory to a marriage . I was interested in the role of shared memories in a marriage , especially a long marriage like the one in the book . Most relationships that go for a long time , whether it 's parent -child , siblings , or friends -- over time there are things that we think would be better to just leave behind . There are always dark , uncomfortable passages . It might seem the best thing to just bury them . With something like a marriage you have to ask , if you just deny that something 's happened , and you literally forget it , what does that do to the love ? Is it somehow inauthentic ? Is it \u201c real \u201d love still ? On the other hand , if you do actually go back and look at it squarely , would that destroy the love as well ? On writing about memory and forgetting as a kind of supernatural force : I needed some way of everybody losing their memories , or their memories at least being very , very patchy . This might be a metaphor of a much more complicated and subtle thing that happens in our world : Our memories are controlled by the media , popular entertainment , history books , and museums . School textbooks are a significant , conspicuous example of people trying to control societal memory . There 's regularly a rouse about this in Japan , of course . Japanese school textbooks do not mention what the Japanese did in the Second World War in Southeast Asia . It 's not magic , but somebody is exercising something like that . In my simplified , mythical landscape I created a kind of mist that had fallen over this land , that had a supernatural quality of making people forget . You could argue that it 's been done with a relatively good end in mind : to stop the cycle of vengeance . Sometimes you can only do this by forcing a kind of amnesia . The peace is held uneasily in my story , by this mist . [ In my book ] , this couple starts to think , well , we need our memories for our love to survive . Where can we go to find a solution to this ? How can we make the memories come back ? Hence it becomes a story about people who want this mist to go away , and people who want this mist to stay . On classifying his books as science - fiction , fantasy , or other literary genres : I suppose I could 've set it in the future , and people would 've called it sci-fi . If you do a story about long , long ago , people call it fantastical . On why Marcel Proust is overrated : To be absolutely honest , apart from the opening volume of Proust , I find him crushingly dull . The trouble with Proust is that sometimes you go through an absolutely wonderful passage , but then you have to go about 200 pages of intense French snobbery , high - society maneuverings and pure self - indulgence . It goes on and on and on and on . But every now and again , I suppose around memory , he can be beautiful . I 'm not sure he talks about memory in the way that I do in this book . He 's really good at capturing the emotional essence of memory . I suppose he got people like me thinking about writing about memory in the first place . On the portrayal of memory in novels as opposed to movies : Most novels at some point use memory in some way . And memory often works well in novels . It does n't work very well in films . It 's something to do with the form . We have the flashback device , which is very much a device -- it 's quite clunky . It 's a storytelling device rather than a serious attempt to capture the texture of memory . Every now and again someone tries to do it . I 'm wondering if it 's also to do with the fact that when we remember , we tend to remember in stills . If I ask you now to recall some sort of key memory from your childhood , you may find that it 's still images . It 's full of emotions , and you have to figure out how the emotions fit into that tableau vivant . And then you start to say , what was happening just before this picture , and what happened just after that moment ? In novel - writing that 's quite natural . You 've got that interior monologue that can supply that . The moving image seems to be contrary to the way our memory works . It 's very concrete and present-tense , and it unwinds in a regular way . That does n't seem to be anything like memory ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

When the theme park opened on July 1 , 1974 , it was just called Great Adventure , the manifestation of a grand vision by Warner LeRoy , the son of \" The Wizard of Oz \" producer Mervyn LeRoy and Doris Warner , the daughter of Warner Brothers Studios executive Harry Warner . With the flamboyance of Liberace and the business savvy of Donald Trump , LeRoy arrived on the scene in Ocean County in the early 1970s with money to burn and a pair of borzois ( Russian wolfhounds ) at his side . Like a kid playing with a model railroad set , LeRoy had designed a 1,500 - acre theme park and resort in his imagination \u2014 settling on the Pine Barrens in rural Jackson as a location . Land here was relatively inexpensive and unencumbered at the time , and close enough to both the New York and Philadelphia markets to attract investors . Here , LeRoy pitched the original name of his dream , the \" Enchanted Forest and Safari Park , \" which he saw as becoming a sprawling complex with rides , exotic animals for the open-air zoo and any number of attractions . One day , he presumed , his creation would rival Walt Disney World in Florida , said Harry Applegate , who is the theme park 's unofficial historian and operator of the website greatadventurehistory.com . \" Projected costs quickly escalated and the plans were dramatically scaled back , \" Applegate said . \" Even so , some of the oversized and over - the - top designs which he envisioned for the entire property did make their way into the park that was built . \" Those concepts that came to fruition included The Fort ( which houses the Runaway Mine Train and one end of the Skyway , and once included the Super Teepee and the Conestoga Wagon ) , in Great Adventure 's western section ( formerly called Rootin ' Tootin ' Rip Roarin ' ) , in addition to the whimsical - themed ice cream parlor called Yum Yum Palace . The restaurant was constructed to resemble an immense ice cream sundae , with fiberglass used to create a roof of candy , ice cream scoops and swirls , he explained . Ultimately , LeRoy 's direct involvement with the evolution of Great Adventure did not extend much past that first season 40 years ago , Applegate said . LeRoy sold his remaining interest in the park in 1993 . Four years after that first summer , the Six Flags brand was added to the name of Great Adventure and Safari , when the Texas - based entertainment company acquired the park ahead of its 1978 summer season , Applegate said . Six Flags operates 18 parks across North America , including 16 in the United States , one in Montreal and another in Mexico City , and reported $ 1.1 billion in revenue in 2013 , according to the company . LeRoy , who always was thinking ahead to his next big project , would become better known as a restaurateur in the years that followed Great Adventure . He was responsible for bringing glamor and pizzazz to places such as Tavern on the Green and The Russian Tea Room in Manhattan in the 1970s and 1990s , respectively . Under his leadership , both institutions were turned into profitable restaurants and , culturally , into household names , as the Associated Press reported when LeRoy died at the age of 65 in 2001 of complications from lymphoma . Today , Six Flags Great Adventure is the largest seasonal employer in New Jersey , said Kristin Siebeneicher , a spokeswoman for the theme park . Some of those employees from that first year four decades ago have remained with the park to this day . \" The park has changed a great deal over the past 40 years , but one thing has remained the same : Six Flags Great Adventure is a place to create happy , lasting memories with thrills for all ages , \" Siebeneicher said . \" We are proud to celebrate 40 years here in New Jersey . \""},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Confirmation of the appointment was widely awaited : rumors had been circulating for some time , and Cardinal Burke disclosed the Pope 's decision himself in an interview last month . The move means that Cardinal Burke , 66 , is completely removed from the Curia and holds a purely honorary position without any influence in the governance of the universal Church . Given his age and seniority , such a move is unprecedented and many therefore view it as a demotion . He will be replaced by Archbishop Dominique Mamberti , the Vatican Secretary for Relations with States \u2013 effectively the Holy See 's foreign minister . Some have speculated whether Cardinal Burke 's appointment is a result of his outspoken criticisms during the synod . But rumors of the transfer , first circulated by veteran Vatican watcher Sandro Magister , began in mid-September , considerably earlier than the meeting . Although he has criticised how the synod was run , the cardinal has insisted he supports the Pope , saying he remains at Francis ' service and has no personal animosity towards him . Last year , Pope Francis removed Cardinal Burke from a committee of the Congregation for Bishops that advises the Pope on episcopal appointments . It 's widely known that a small group of cardinals advised Francis to remove him from the committee because of his tendency to block candidates who were considered not sufficiently orthodox or capable of serving as bishops . His position as patron of the Knights of Malta is Rome - based and mostly ceremonial . He is nevertheless likely to continue and perhaps even step up his defense of the Church 's teaching in the face of continued efforts to radically alter pastoral practice in the run - up to next year 's second synod on the family . Archbishop Mamberti will be replaced by Archbishop Paul Gallagher , a native of Liverpool , England , who is currently the apostolic nuncio to Australia . Gallagher notably succeeded Archbishop Michael Courtney as apostolic nuncio to Burundi after Courtney was murdered in the country in December 2003 ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

To escape the pressures of the problems currently gripping the country , he is also said to invite friends over for a game of snooker . When he is on his own , he takes on a machine that fires tennis balls at him at high velocity , which he has nicknamed \u201c the Clegger \u201d following his closely - fought victory against the Deputy Prime Minister . The book , titled Cameron : Practically a Conservative , suggests his capacity to unwind is crucial to his ability to cope with the strains of the job . The book is written by Francis Elliott of The Times and James Hanning of The Independent on Sunday . In extracts published on Saturday , in Mr Elliot 's newspaper , the books claims the Prime Minister 's Sunday routine generally starts early in he morning with the newspapers and time working on his computer . Friends quoted in the book say that throughout the day it can then involve \u201c a c- -- film on telly , play with the children , cook , have three or four glasses of wine with lunch , have an afternoon nap , play tennis \u201d . The book also discloses how Steve Hilton the outgoing Number 10 director of implementation , left Downing Street this week believing Mr Cameron had become too focused on power rather than forcing through radical change . Despite their 20 - year friendship , the book is said to chart a loss of faith between Mr Cameron and his policy guru , who left Downing Street this week for a post at a Californian university .

With Britain in recession and the Conservatives slipping in the polls , the Prime Minister 's leisure habits have increasingly been used as political ammunition against him by both Conservative and Labour opponents as a sign of a lack of application . Mr Cameron , 45 , has been dubbed \u201c DVD Dave \u201d for his love of box sets and mocked for enjoying weekly \u201c date nights \u201d with his wife , Samantha , 41 . But friends say Mr Cameron 's enthusiasm for pursuits other than work is a healthy sign of an appetite for life . On Friday night , a Downing Street spokesman said : \" This weekend the Prime Minister will be working at the G8 and Nato summits in Washington and Chicago , before returning to a full week 's work in the UK . \" He considers the job of Prime Minister , with its requirements to be on duty seven days a week , to be an enormous privilege . \""},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

The 238 mid- to late-nineteenth - century novelists listed in the Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature , vol. 4 1800 - 1900 ( 3rd. ed. , 1999 ) represent the most enduring of approximately 7,000 authors identified by John Sutherland ( The Longman Companion to Victorian Fiction , 1988 ) as entitled to call themselves ' novelist ' . From the society novels of the 1830s , to ' industrial ' novels reflecting the desperate lives of the poor , historical and domestic novels , tales of adventure , the emerging detective stories of the 1860s , the sensational novel and science fiction , they were responsible for an astonishing range of literature . This activity was fostered by an increasingly skilful and professional publishing system . Most Victorian novels were published in three volumes at 31s. 6d , or 10s . 6d per volume . Although too expensive for the average purchaser , this price enabled the publisher to cover his costs on a comparatively small edition ( usually 1,000 copies ) , and allowed for a reasonable payment to the author . The majority of readers , who could not afford to buy new novels , flocked to the circulating libraries which sprang up all over the country . Led by Charles Mudie 's establishment in New Oxford Street , these controlled a significant share of the market in new novels , keeping a censorious eye on the moral and religious content of their stock . At the same time , authors and publishers were anxious to increase their sales by reducing the price of new fiction . The unexpected success of Dickens 's Pickwick Papers in 1836 - 7 revitalised the old practice of publishing in shilling monthly numbers . Serialisation in periodicals ( and , to a lesser extent , newspapers ) was also popular , especially from the 1860s with the founding of important literary journals like the Cornhill Magazine , Belgravia , and The Argosy . In both cases , famous artists of the day were often commissioned to provide high quality illustrations , which were an additional inducement to purchase . With increased sales came the prospect of improved payments for at least some authors , which in turn contributed to the professionalisation of authorship during the century . Once a serial had been completed , and the novel had exhausted its original market in three volumes , it might be reprinted in a cheaper ( usually 6 shilling ) one - volume edition , and then again as a yellowback in one of the popular Railway Libraries . As the century progressed , the intervals between these editions tended to contract , and by the 1880s the 6 shilling novel was beginning to emerge as the preferred form for new fiction . Faced with the growth of free libraries , and increasingly vociferous complaints from authors about censorship of their work , the circulating libraries finally took matters into their own hands . In 1894 they announced that they would pay no more than 4 shillings a volume for fiction - in effect signalling the death of the ' three - decker ' ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

The 25- year-old was sentenced at Wood Green crown court on Tuesday over the April attack at the Mangle E8 club in Dalston , east London , which happened after he got into a fight with a group of men . He had been convicted at a hearing in November of five counts of grievous bodily harm with intent and nine counts of actual bodily harm . Passing sentence , Judge Noel Lucas QC said : \u201c Your case has attracted a great deal of public interest . This is because what you did at the Mangle club ... was a despicable act . \u201d Lucas praised the \u201c extraordinary courage \u201d of three women who stood in court to describe the impact of their injuries . Phoebe Giorgiu , who suffered burns on her chest , breasts and arms , said the biggest challenge had been mental , including ongoing anxiety attacks that had stopped her from going to bars , clubs and other crowded places since . \u201c The thoughts that filled my mind were suicidal , \u201d she said of her state of the mind in the aftermath of the attack . \u201c Do I want to carry on knowing what 's underneath my bandages ? \u201d Lauren Trent had been celebrating her 22nd birthday at Mangle on the night of the attack . \u201c Forever , my birthday will be the anniversary of the night I was involved in an acid attack , \u201d she sobbed . Turning to Collins in the dock , she added : \u201c From the moment you threw the contents of that bottle you changed not only my life and my best friend 's life , [ but ] my family , my friends and your life . \u201d Sophie Hall , also 22 , cried as she remembered her experiences of the night . \u201c I knew my face was a mess because I could feel it in my hands , \u201d she said . \u201c It was blistered . \u201d She now hides the facial scars from the incident with makeup , but is unable to mask the scars on her arm and shoulder , she said . Collins , was told he had demonstrated not the least remorse for his actions , which injured 14 people . Collins was already serving a six-month sentence , suspended for a year , after punching a man outside a nightclub in Greenwich , an attack that had left the victim needing 20 stitches . The prosecution detailed five previous convictions , dating to 2008 , including for public order offences , criminal damage , driving while disqualified and possession of cocaine . The court also heard that Collins had in 2013 accepted a caution after the mother of his ex-girlfriend complained to police that he had phoned her to call her \u201c a cunt \u201d and threaten her with an acid attack . In mitigation , George Carter -Stephenson QC produced a thick folder of social media posts made by Giorgiu , Trent and Hall in the months following the attack . Going through each one by one , he pointed to posts and pictures \u2013 including several taken from holidays \u2013 that , he said , showed their scarring did not amount to serious disfigurement , and that claims of panic attacks in crowded places were overblown . Asked by the judge whether such a tactic was not unnecessarily invasive , he replied : \u201c One has to be careful that it [ the victim impact statement ] accurately does reflect the situation . There is no doubt that the three victims this court has heard from have suffered , but it is important that this court has balance . \u201d The defence also produced a psychological report that it said showed that Collins was an individual of limited intelligence , with a low IQ that bordered on a learning disability ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Palataan 60 vuoden takaiselle Linnanm\u00e4elle . Elokuussa 1959 Linnanm\u00e4ke\u00e4 py\u00f6ritt\u00e4v\u00e4 Lasten P\u00e4iv\u00e4n S\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6 l\u00e4hestyi Tampereen kaupunginhallitusta . Taustalla oli tanskalaiselta tivolinpit\u00e4j\u00e4lt\u00e4 ostetut kymmenen laitetta ja s\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6n halu laajentaa toimintaa Tampereelle . Kaupunginhallitus innostui ja perusti huvipuistotoimikunnan , joka aloitti mmun muassa ahkeran matkustelun maailman huvipuistoissa . Sijoituspaikastakin l\u00f6ytyi nopeasti yksimielisyys . Se oli Ratinanniemi . Sit\u00e4 valmistelemaan perustettiin vuonna 1962 Ratinanpuisto Oy . Huvipuistotoimikunnan matkoilla ideoita sikisi . M\u00e4lm\u00f6n mallin mukaan huvipuistoon haluttiin muun muassa p\u00e4iv\u00e4hoitotoimintaa . Lis\u00e4ksi huvipuistotoimikunta p\u00e4\u00e4tyi operoimaan kalojen ja t\u00e4htien kanssa . Tampereen Huvipuiston yhteyteen haluttiin saada my\u00f6s akvaario ja planetaario . Miksi n\u00e4m\u00e4 ? Selitykseksi S\u00e4rk\u00e4nniemen 40 -vuotishistoriikin kirjoittanut Maria Eskelinen nostaa sen , ett\u00e4 huvipuistotoimikunnan puheenjohtaja , apulaiskaupunginjohtaja Sampo Toni oli kova kalamies ja kaupunginjohtaja Erkki Lindfors harrasti t\u00e4htitiedett\u00e4 . Eik\u00e4 t\u00e4ss\u00e4 viel\u00e4 kaikki . Vuonna 1965 huvipuistoajatuksesta p\u00e4\u00e4dyttiin taas sivuraiteelle , kun Lindfors innostui Kuopiossa Puijon tornista . Py\u00f6riv\u00e4n n\u00e4k\u00f6tornin saamiseksi kaupunkiin perustettiin n\u00e4k\u00f6tornitoimikunta suunnittelemaan Puijon tornia v\u00e4hint\u00e4\u00e4n 10 metri\u00e4 korkeampaa kohdetta . Miten S\u00e4rk\u00e4nniemi sitten p\u00e4\u00e4tyi S\u00e4rk\u00e4nniemeen ? T\u00e4st\u00e4 voi syytt\u00e4\u00e4 n\u00e4k\u00f6torni-ideaa . Kortelahden kallio muun muassa veneveist\u00e4m\u00f6ist\u00e4 ja oluttehtaista tunnetuksi tulleessa S\u00e4rk\u00e4nniemess\u00e4 katsottiin edullisimmaksi paikaksi , varsinkin kun tilaa oli my\u00f6s akvaariolle ja planetaariolle . Kun ideaa esiteltiin loppuvuodesta 1965 lehdist\u00f6lle , pyysi Lindfors poistamaan mietinn\u00f6st\u00e4 kaikki hintatiedot ik\u00e4vien yleis\u00f6nosastokirjoitusten ehk\u00e4isemiseksi . Lehdist\u00f6 otti hankkeen vastaan innostuneena . Tammikuussa 1966 n\u00e4k\u00f6tornitoimikunnan mietinn\u00f6n pohjalta perustettiin Tampereen S\u00e4rk\u00e4nniemi Oy . Ensin p\u00e4\u00e4tettiin rakentaa akvaario-planetaario ja sitten n\u00e4k\u00f6torni . Tosin t\u00e4ss\u00e4 vaiheessa ajatus karkaili taas . Tampereella eli pitk\u00e4aikainen haave my\u00f6s pysyv\u00e4n el\u00e4intarhan saamisesta . Taustalla olivat Lindforsin Puolan Lodzista vuonna 1960 lahjaksi saamat leijonanpennut Tam ja Pere . Ensin Korkeasaaressa ja sitten Tampere-talon paikalla vanhan teurastamon tiloissa olleiden leijonien ymp\u00e4rille kaavailtiin el\u00e4intarhaa S\u00e4rk\u00e4nniemeen . Vuosikymmenen lopulla suunnitelmissa olivat muun muassa pingviinialue , saukkotalo , bambialue , sis\u00e4el\u00e4intarha trooppisine sademetsineen . Lennokkaista ideoista kaksi toteutui . Paperilla olivat my\u00f6s delfiinialtaat ja lasten el\u00e4intarha . Nyttemmin Koiram\u00e4en el\u00e4inpuistoksi muuttunut Lasten el\u00e4intarha avattiin kes\u00e4ll\u00e4 1970 ja delfinaario vuonna 1985 . Planetaario ehdittiin vuonna 1967 alkaneiden rakennust\u00f6iden aikana risti\u00e4 jo S\u00e4rk\u00e4n moskeijaksi kupolin muodon takia . Avaaminen viiv\u00e4styi , sill\u00e4 planetaariolaitteet saatiin japanilaiselta Minoltalta vasta talvella 1969 . Akvaario-planetaarion avajaisia vietettiin 25 . huhtikuuta vuonna 1969 . Jo ensimm\u00e4isen viikon aikana vieraita k\u00e4vi l\u00e4hes 16 000 , vaikka 2,50 markan p\u00e4\u00e4sylippua pidettiin kalliina . N\u00e4sinneula avattiin yleis\u00f6lle huhtikuussa 1971 . Sitten oli se huvipuistohanke , jos viel\u00e4 muistatte . Ratinanpuisto Oy operoi edelleen alkuper\u00e4isen suunnitelman parissa huvipuistoa Ratinanniemeen . Vuonna 1969 tehdyss\u00e4 kokonaissuunnitelmassa huvipuistoa soviteltiin el\u00e4intarhojen kanssa jo S\u00e4rk\u00e4nniemeen . Uskoa lis\u00e4si akvaario-planetaarion suosion osoittama paikan edullisuus . Stadion ja uusi tie olivat muuttaneet Ratinan jo liian ahtaaksi . Ratkaisu tuli vuonna 1970 . Ratinanpuisto Oy ja Tampereen S\u00e4rk\u00e4nniemi Oy fuusioitiin ja huvipuistoidea siirtyi S\u00e4rk\u00e4nniemeen . Vuosina 1972 ja 1973 huvilaitteita py\u00f6rittiv\u00e4t yksityiset yritt\u00e4j\u00e4t . Linnanm\u00e4en Lasten P\u00e4iv\u00e4n S\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6n kanssa tehtiin sopimus muun muassa laitteiden vuokraamisesta vuonna 1974 . Huvipuisto avattiin vappuna 1975 yli 6 vuotta akvaarion ja planetaarion ja 16 vuotta huvipuistotoimikunnan perustamisen j\u00e4lkeen .

RADC work on technology used in COBRA DANE began as early as 1955 with SARAC , the Steerable Array Radar and Communications program . COBRA DANE was designed as an intelligence gathering radar capable of collecting data on Soviet missile launch tests into Kamchatka or the Pacific Ocean . In conjunction with the Electronic Systems Division , the Center worked on performance specifications and the Statement of Work for the system , and requests for proposals were sent to numerous companies . Raytheon eventually won the contract . By 1976 RADC completed technical assistance and engineering support for installation and testing of the COBRA DANE radar system . The COBRA DANE radar system was completed and turned over to the Air Defense command in July 1977 . In 1978 , the RADC Cobra Dane Program Director 's Office was awarded an Air Force Organizational Excellence Award for its efforts . First deployed in 1977 , the AN \/ FPS - 108 radar operates in the 1215 - 1400 MHz band using a 29 m phased array antenna . The primary mission is to track and collect data on foreign intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) and submarine launched ballistic missile ( SLBM ) test launches to the Kamchatka impact area and the broad ocean impact areas in the Pacific Ocean . The metric and signature data collected support START 2 and INF treaty monitoring , and scientific and technical intelligence efforts ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

No one had ever used the term \" black humour \" before this one came along , unless , perhaps , it was from a racial angle . It 's one of those books that is influential beyond all commercial measure ; it very nearly did n't get published at all and , in a sense , did n't properly enter the public sphere until well after its proper time . Breton , founder of literary surrealism , had the idea for the book in 1935 ; he saw the book as an important artistic statement , an expression of something that he had noticed and that he felt needed to be said . Various problems delayed publication until just before the Nazi defeat of France ; the Vichy government wasted no time in banning it . It came out again in 1945 , to almost complete silence - presumably Breton was considered pretty much vieux jeu by then . Another slightly revised edition came out in 1950 , and then a \" definitive \" one in 1966 , shortly before Breton 's death - by which time people were beginning to see what he was driving at . He begins with Swift 's \" Directions to Servants \" , \" A Modest Proposal \" , \" A Meditation on a Broom -Stick \" , and a few of his aphorisms ; as far as Breton was concerned , \" when it comes to black humour , everything designates [ Swift ] as the true originator . \" This seems self - evident to us now , because we know what black humour is - but that 's because Breton defined and coined the concept . ( He refused to make any additions to the 1966 edition : \" It should never be seen as some sort of constantly updated annual , a pathetic honour roll bearing no trace whatsoever of its original purpose . \" ) After this , we have 44 other writers , chronologically arranged , from De Sade to - well , the last one you 're most likely to have heard of is Leonora Carrington ( who 's still alive , incidentally ) . Each author is given an introduction - some of these can be rather more impenetrable than one would expect or wish from a conventional anthology ; but then this is not , as you 've gathered by now , a conventional anthology . Some of the entries you may not think are particularly funny . The extracts from Lautr\u00e9amont 's Maldoror , for instance , are not going to have you in stitches unless you have a particularly refined sense of humour ; but as a precursor of surrealism he had to go in , and reading him here , you could say , absolves one from the duty of reading him elsewhere . But for the most part Breton 's inclusions are illuminating , a more worthwhile example of the surrealist project in action than surrealism itself : it makes writers and their works look new by placing them in unusual lighting . ( Breton avoids using the word \" surrealism \" , incidentally . This is more than just a manifesto , which is why this book is probably going to stay in print for longer than his others . ) There are more than just the usual suspects here . You can see why Kafka , Alfred Jarry , Poe , Lewis Carroll , Rimbaud and Apollinaire , to pick a few names more or less at random , had to be represented , but O Henry is a bit of a surprise ( a pleasant one ) ; Gide , too , especially when he is followed , some pages later , by a scabrous lampoon of him by Arthur Cravan . ( \" M Gide 's handwritten letter can be procured at our offices for the price of 0.15 francs . \" ) It is not , I should warn you , a very easy book to get into - which is a bit disconcerting for us , seeing that modern anthologies try to be as user-friendly as possible . But once you accept its idiosyncrasies you will find yourself in an unsettling world , one that is both very familiar - it is pleasant for the anglophone reader to run into so many texts written originally in English - and yet capable of leaping out at you in the most unexpected way . It 's a testament to originality , to defiance of convention , a revolt against sentimentality , and if you 've ever used the term \" black humour \" yourself , or expressed a liking for it , then you really ought to have this on your shelf ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

These two German trench loopholes are typical of the types used in this area and nearly a century later still look down on the old French front line ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

In addition to the music , the track 's lyrics also gave way to nostalgia , harkening back to the Golden Age of Hollywood as evident in Madonna 's spoken rap section in the bridge where she name - drops a bevy of cultural icons : Greta Garbo , and Monroe Dietrich and DiMaggio Marlon Brando , Jimmy Dean On the cover of a magazine Grace Kelly ; Harlow , Jean Picture of a beauty queen Gene Kelly , Fred Astaire Ginger Rogers , dance on air They had style , they had grace Rita Hayworth gave good face Lauren , Katherine , Lana too Bette Davis , we love you Ladies with an attitude Fellows that were in the mood Do n't just stand there , let 's get to it Strike a pose , there 's nothing to it Vogue , vogue Coupled with a stylized black - and - white music video , which was famously directed by David Fincher , the Material Girl 's homage to 1920s and 1930s Hollywood was sheer perfection to her fans , who helped her bring home three MTV Video Music Awards in 1990 . For those of you who want to vogue down memory lane and learn some biographical trivia of the stars in Madonna 's rap , we 've compiled the list for you Greta Garbo Swedish - American actress Greta Garbo is considered one of the greatest female actresses of classical Hollywood cinema , and her breathtaking beauty \u2014 famous for her long pencil-thin eyebrows and sultry eyes \u2014 is only just one aspect that made her a star . During the 1920s and 30s , she made a splash with silent films such as Torrent ( 1926 ) and Flesh and the Devil ( 1926 ) and later transitioned into talking films , scoring big with Annie Christie ( 1930 ) , Mata Hari ( 1931 ) , Grand Hotel ( 1932 ) , and Camille ( 1936 ) . In all Garbo made 28 films in her career and earned three Academy Award nominations \u2014 later receiving an honorary Oscar in 1954 . Fiercely private , Garbo retired from acting at the age of 35 and spent her later years as an art collector . Marilyn Monroe With her platinum blonde hair , breathy voice and curves , Marilyn Monroe set herself up as the unequivocal blonde bombshell and sex symbol for the ages . Her troubled childhood as an orphan haunted her throughout her career despite finding immense success with films like Gentlemen Prefer Blondes ( 1953 ) , How to Marry a Millionaire ( 1953 ) , The Seven Year Itch ( 1955 ) , and Some Like It Hot ( 1959 ) . Her inner demons did not relent , despite marrying accomplished men like Arthur Miller and Joe DiMaggio , whom she eventually both divorced . While en route to making something of a comeback with her final film Something 's Got to Give , Monroe was found dead in her Brentwood home from an apparent barbiturate overdose at the age of 36 . Marlene Dietrich As one of the highest paid Hollywood actresses of her time , Marlene Dietrich had an enduring career that lasted seven decades , thanks to her uncanny ability to reinvent herself . Throughout the 1920s , the German - born actress was a sought - after silent film actress , eventually moving on to talking films like Morocco ( 1930 ) , Shanghai Express ( 1932 ) and Desire ( 1936 ) . She was a celebrity fixture during World War II and began a two -decade career as a live - show performer starting in the 1950s . Outside of her film work , Dietrich was a passionate humanitarian , advocating for the rights of German and French exiles during the war . Joe DiMaggio During his 13 - year tenure in Major League Baseball , Joe DiMaggio was a New York Yankee through and through . As a center fielder , three - time MVP and nine - time World Series champion , DiMaggio is lauded as one of the best players in baseball history . In 1955 he became a Baseball Hall of Famer and is also remembered for his enduring devotion to former wife Marilyn Monroe . The pair married in January 1954 , which was hailed \" the Marriage of the Century . \" The union lasted less than a year ( despite an 18 - month courtship ) , but they remained close friends . DiMaggio reportedly had roses delivered to her crypt three times a week for 20 years . Marlon Brando Marlon Brando may have been known for his strikingly good looks in his youth and later , for his personal self - indulgence , but his professional status as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century remains solidly intact . His roles in such memorable films as A Streetcar Named Desire ( 1951 ) , On the Waterfront ( 1954 ) and The Godfather ( 1972 ) \u2014 the last two of which he received Academy Awards for \u2014 changed the cultural landscape of cinema . With additional blockbuster hits like Last Tango in Paris ( 1972 ) and Apocalypse Now ( 1979 ) , Brando secured his place as one of the highest paid actors of his era and a master of his craft . James Dean James Dean made only three films in his brief career \u2014 Rebel Without a Cause ( 1955 ) , East of Eden ( 1955 ) and Giant ( 1956 ) \u2014 yet he had already become a force in Hollywood . Through his characters ' brooding ways and estranged dispositions , Dean became a symbol of his generation , but he 'd never have an opportunity to further explore his artistic gifts . When Dean was n't acting , he was a professional racecar driver . At just 24 , his life was cut short in a high - speed car accident off a California highway , when a Cal Poly student collided with Dean 's vehicle . Dean was killed immediately . Grace Kelly Her Hollywood career may have been short -lived , but Grace Kelly is ranked as one of the top actresses of classic cinema . Kelly turned heads starting in 1953 with the film Mogambo and became a star in The Country Girl ( 1954 ) , earning her an Oscar for Best Actress . Other box office hits followed , including Alfred Hitchcock - directed films like Dial M for Murder ( 1954 ) , Rear Window ( 1954 ) and To Catch a Thief ( 1955 ) co-starring Cary Grant . But at 26 , Kelly was ready to say goodbye to Hollywood and embrace royal life as Princess Grace of Monaco through her marriage to Prince Rainier III . After having three children with the prince and dutifully serving her adopted country for decades , Princess Grace died from a car accident at 52 . Jean Harlow Dubbed the \" Blonde Bombshell , \" Jean Harlow was one of the biggest stars and sex symbols of 1930s Hollywood cinema . ( Fun Fact : Howard Hughes offered $ 10,000 to any stylist who could duplicate the color of Harlow 's platinum - blonde hair , but never found anyone who could do it successfully . ) Her role in Hell 's Angels ( 1930 ) helped prove her bankability , and she followed it up with a number of hit films like Red Dust ( 1932 ) , Red - Headed Woman ( 1932 ) , Dinner at Eight ( 1933 ) , Reckless ( 1935 ) , and Suzy ( 1936 ) . Yet despite Harlow 's fast -moving , successful career , her star would not burn bright for long . At just 26 , she unexpectedly died of kidney failure . Gene Kelly The movie musical would never be the same after actor and choreographer Gene Kelly danced his way into it . The Pittsburgh native 's classical ballet technique combined with his athletic style and good looks charmed their way into moviegoers ' hearts and offered them a visual masterpiece they had never experienced before . Utilizing unique camera angles and bold mass movement in his musical storytelling , Kelly is best known for his performances in An American in Paris ( 1951 ) , Anchors Aweigh ( 1945 ) and above all , Singin ' in the Rain ( 1952 ) . His contributions to the industry earned him an Academy Honorary Award in 1952 . Fred Astaire As an homage to his predecessor , Gene Kelly once said that \" the history of dance on film begins with Astaire . \" With a career that spanned close to eight decades , Fred Astaire is viewed as the most important dancer in film history . Known for being light on his feet , he is widely remembered for his onscreen pairing with Ginger Rogers . The paired starred in films like Top Hat ( 1935 ) , Swing Time ( 1936 ) and Carefree ( 1938 ) . Rogers called him \" the best partner anyone could ever have . \" A multi-talented artist , Astaire was also a singer , choreographer and television personality . Ginger Rogers \" Sure he [ Astaire ] was great , but do n't forget that Ginger Rogers did everything he did ... backwards and in high heels , \" so said a caption from Bob Thaves ' Frank and Ernest cartoon in 1982 . In her prolific career , Rogers made over 70 films , including Top Hat , Swing Time , The Gay Divorcee , and 42nd Street . She also danced her way throughout the 1930s with Fred Astaire and helping reinvent the movie musical . She would later become one of the top actresses of the 1940s , earning an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in Kitty Foyle . She also costarred with other \" Vogue \" icon Marilyn Monroe in Monkey Business ( 1952 ) . Rita Hayworth Dancer by trade with stunning looks to boot , Rita Hayworth was known as \" The Love Goddess \" for her sultry charisma onscreen . She was one of the biggest box office draws and pin-up girls of the 1940s and is most famous for her film Gilda ( 1946 ) but is also celebrated for her collaboration with Gene Kelly in the musical Cover Girl ( 1944 ) . A trained dancer , her career ended with Ralph Nelson 's The Wrath of God ( 1972 ) . Hayworth died from Alzheimer 's disease in 1987 , which was not widely known at the time , but when her illness was made public , it helped increase awareness . Lauren Bacall Lauren Bacall 's smoky voice and cat eyes made her irresistible on the big screen , and audiences took to her immediately when she made her film debut as the female lead in To Have and Have Not ( 1946 ) , co-starring her future husband Humphrey Bogart . Bacall would continue making a number of successful films including Key Largo ( 1948 ) , How to Marry a Millionaire ( 1953 ) , Designing Women ( 1957 ) , and Murder on the Orient Express ( 1976 ) . She would successfully transition from screen to stage , winning two Tonys for her Broadway performances in Applause ( 1970 ) and Woman of the Year ( 1981 ) . In 1996 she would earn an Academy Award nomination for her role in The Mirror Has Two Faces . Katharine Hepburn Ranked as the top actress in Classic Hollywood Cinema , Katharine Hepburn had a career that lasted six decades and won a record four Academy Awards under the Best Actress category . Her defined features , as well as her unconventional independent attitude , enhanced the strength she exuded in her roles on stage and on the screen . Successful films include Morning Glory ( 1933 ) and The Philadelphia Story ( 1940 ) , the latter of which she personally helped adapt to film to help resurrect her career . Always perfecting her craft , Hepburn challenged herself in her later years , starring in award - winning films like The African Queen ( 1951 ) , Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner ( 1967 ) and On Golden Pond ( 1981 ) . Hepburn continued to act into her late 80s . She died at 96 . Lana Turner Still in high school , Lana Turner was famously discovered at a Hollywood malt shop when the stars came knocking . Signed to MGM , she eventually became the studio 's biggest female star in the 1940s and at one point , the highest paid woman in America . With a career that stretched five decades , Turner was considered a sex symbol and a talented actress , with The Postman Always Rings Twice ( 1946 ) cementing her ability to play dramatic roles . Other films include The Bad and the Beautiful ( 1952 ) , Peyton Place ( 1957 ) , Imitation of Life ( 1959 ) , and Madame X ( 1966 ) . Turner 's personal life also brought public interest ; the glamorous femme fatale turned out to be a serial bride , marrying seven times . Bette Davis Katharine Hepburn may be ranked as the American Film Institute 's greatest actress in Classic Hollywood Cinema , but Bette Davis comes in at a close second \u2014 and it 's not because she played by the rules . Known for her intense and forceful nature as well as her chain smoking and nervy voice , Davis was a perfectionist when it came to her work . Hailed for her performances in Dangerous ( 1935 ) and Jezebel ( 1938 ) , both of which earned her Academy Awards for Best Actress , Davis is also remembered for her roles in Dark Victory ( 1939 ) and All About Eve ( 1950 ) . In 1941 she became the first female president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and before her career ended , accrued over 100 film , television and theater credits to her name ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

When Native American tribes were forced from their ancestral homelands in the southeastern United States to what is now Oklahoma in the 1800s \u2014 known as the Trail of Tears \u2014 thousands of Black slaves owned by tribal members also were removed and forced to provide manual labor along the way . Once in Oklahoma , slaves often toiled on plantation - style farms or were servants in tribal members ' homes . Nearly 200 years later , many of the thousands of descendants of those Black slaves , known as Freedmen , are still fighting to be recognized by the tribes that once owned their ancestors . The fight has continued since the killing of George Floyd last year by a Minneapolis police officer spurred a reexamination of the vestiges of slavery in the U.S. CHEROKEE NATION FREEDMEN The Cherokee , Chickasaw , Choctaw , Muscogee ( Creek ) and Seminole nations were referred to historically as the Five Civilized Tribes , or Five Tribes , by European settlers because they often assimilated into the settlers ' culture , adopting their style of dress and religion , and even owning slaves . Each tribe also has a unique history with Freedmen , whose rights were ultimately spelled out in separate treaties with the U.S. Today , the Cherokee Nation is the only tribe that fully recognizes the Freedmen as full citizens , a decision that came in 2017 following years of legal wrangling . \u201c I think that we are a better tribe for having not only embraced the federal court decision but embraced the concept of equality , \u201d said Cherokee Nation Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. , a longtime supporter of citizenship rights for the Freedmen . The Cherokee Nation , among the largest Native American tribes , has about 5,800 Freedmen citizens who have traced an ancestor on the tribe 's original Freedmen rolls in the late 19th century . When the federal government sought to break up tribal reservations into individual allotments after the Civil War , they created two separate tribal rolls \u2014 one for members with American Indian blood and one for Freedmen . In many cases , tribal citizens who appeared Black were placed on the Freedmen rolls , even if they had blood ties to the tribe . Of the Five Tribes , only the Chickasaw Nation never agreed to adopt the Freedmen as citizens , according to the Oklahoma Historical Society . SEMINOLE NATION CONTROVERSY The Wewoka - based Seminole Nation in particular faces fierce criticism after several Black tribal citizens were denied COVID - 19 vaccines at a federally operated American Indian health clinic . LeEtta Osborne-Sampson , a Seminole Freedman who has a tribal identification card and serves on the tribe 's governing council , said she sought a vaccine in February at a clinic operated by the Indian Health Service , an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services . She said a worker told her the Seminole Nation does n't recognize Freedmen for health services . When she asked for additional explanation , the worker called over a tribal police officer , she said . \u201c So , I left , \u201d said Osborne - Sampson . \u201c Even the worst person would try to help when there 's a pandemic all over the world , but they do n't care about the Freedmen . I feel like they want us to die . \u201d Three other Seminole Freedmen shared similar experiences with The Associated Press about the same clinic . The Seminole Nation says the decision about whether to provide vaccines to Seminole Freedmen rests with the IHS , not the tribe . \u201c To be clear , the Seminole Nation does not operate the Wewoka Indian Health Services clinic , has absolutely no policy oversight and was in no way involved with administering COVID - 19 vaccines , \u201d Seminole Nation Chief Greg Chilcoat said in a statement . The agency said in a statement that it was reviewing eligibility of Seminole Freedmen and will be working with the tribe to determine what services IHS will provide . FIGHTING FOR CITIZENSHIP Seminole Freedmen say they are unable to receive services other tribal citizens get , including health care , tribal license plates and housing subsidies . The Seminole Freedmen have been fighting for years to be recognized as full tribal citizens in legal battles that underscore the systemic racism that Freedmen from all Oklahoma - based tribes say they have experienced from tribal governments and their members . Many Seminole Freedmen are descendants of freed Black slaves who joined the Seminoles in Florida during their wars against the U.S. government . \u201c We fought in three wars with them to get where we 're at , and now they 've turned against us , \u201d said Anthony Conley , who also said he was denied a vaccine at the clinic . Conley said he believes racism and an unwillingness of tribal citizens to share tribal funds is at the core of the tribe 's decision to exclude Freedmen from full citizenship , a claim that Chilcoat disputes . TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY The Muscogee ( Creek ) and Choctaw nations have cited tribal sovereignty as reasons for their opposition to citizenship for Freedmen . When Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters of California last year attempted to force the tribes to reconcile the Freedmen issue by inserting language into a housing bill , Choctaw Nation Chief Gary Batton said the U.S. government is responsible for the Freedmen 's plight , not the Choctaw Nation . \u201c There is no more fundamental element of tribal self - governance than the authority of a Tribe like the Choctaw Nation to determine our own citizenship , \u201d Batton wrote in a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi . Ultimately , it might be a decision for the federal courts to make . Osborne - Sampson said she and other Freedmen are consulting with an attorney on how to proceed ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

You may even be wondering what a bread clip is , but they are so ubiquitous there is no doubt you have used one . It 's the little flexible plastic u-shaped locks that come on nearly every bag of bread in the grocery store . They hold the tops of bags of potatoes or apples closed until you 're ready to use them . They are easy enough for a child to master and completely reusable , too , to ensure your English muffins and bagels stay fresh . Frequently they are printed with the use - by date of a product or emblazoned with the company slogan . They are absolutely everywhere closing billionsof bags each year . And almost every single one of those little plastic , indispensable , yet totally dispensable locks are made by one family - owned company , the Kwik Lok company of Yakima , Washington . The company has been making Kwik Loks for over 66 years , ever since Floyd Paxton whittled the first one from a credit card , according to the company 's website ( and first reported by Atlas Obscura . ) Paxton was a manufacturing engineer by training and after World War II he found himself in the heart of Washington State 's apple country looking at a problem . The state 's apple industry had graduated from building wooden crates to ship their fruit to using plastic bags , but they did n't like any of the options for closing them . Like most engineers , Paxton could n't help but try to solve the problem . Inspiration reportedly struck while he was on a plane eating a package of complimentary nuts , The Oregonian reports . He apparently had a small appetite for the nuts , though , because he could n't eat the entire bag and wanted to save them for later , but did n't have a way to seal the bag . His novel solution , was to pull out his trusty pen knife ( you could still bring knives on to planes in 1952 , after all ) and whittle an expired credit card into the first ever Kwik Lok . Paxton realized that his humble whittling was a useful addition to the closure market and established the Kwik Lok Corporation in 1954 in California . He first sold them to the apple industry , eventually moving the company to Washington state , where their headquarters are still located . These days they have six factories and 330 employees all working to make a product whose use has spread far beyond the produce aisle . According to Atlas Obscura , Kwik Lok says they now sell billions of bag closures every single year . Despite its exponential growth , the company is still a family business , too , now run by three sisters : Stephanie Paxton Jackson , Kimberly Paxton-Hagner , and Melissa Steiner .

South Africa 's openers faced just two balls in the gloom before they were heading back to the pavilion with broad grins on their faces . It was an inevitable end , and it was hard to see why West Indies had not just batted through to the close and added to Graeme Smith 's frustration . On a pluperfect batting track and in front of another good crowd , West Indies had made steady rather than spectacular progress , with the run rate never climbing above three an over . In fairness to South Africa , they looked more on the ball than they had yesterday , but on this batsman-friendly surface it made little difference . Overnight rain left the playing area too damp for a prompt start , but when play resumed an hour late it was fairly clear that the bowlers were in for another long day . Both Chanderpaul and Wavell Hinds started circumspectly , Hinds taking 20 minutes to add to his overnight 188 . A taunt of \" Boring , Wavell , that 's boring , \" from Graeme Smith in the slips only stirred him and thereafter he got back into his stride , bringing up his double hundred with a punch behind square on the off . He then played the shot of the match , a classical straight drive off the disappointing Makhaya Ntini . Chanderpaul began the brighter , flicking the second ball he faced for four , but displayed remarkable concentration in his shot selection , happy to duck bouncers and leave any temptation outside his off stump . He punished anything on his legs as well as unleashing a few sumptuous drives through the covers . There was no respite for the South Africans as one Hinds was replaced by another , Ryan , who started uncertainly but slowly found his grove . He added 116 with his captain before on 47 he aimed a drive at a flighted ball from Boje but only edged straight to Jacques Kallis at first slip . If Hinds had played well enough to deserve his fifty , Boje had earned the wicket with his perseverance on an unhelpful surface . As Chanderpaul pressed on , Narsingh Deonarine , the fifth left-hander in the top seven and another making his debut , survived a jittery start and a hostile welcome from Andre Nel and gradually found his touch . The run rate continued to fall as the ball grew soft , and a message came out from Bennett King , the coach , to get things moving . Then came Chanderpaul 's moment of triumph , which nobody would begrudge him in the difficult circumstances surrounding this match . The shame was that seconds later it was followed by the declaration which was so badly timed .

There were losses but I do not have exact figures , \" he said , promising a \" tough wipe - out \" of rebels in the settlement . The rebels seized the villages on Sunday night as they tried to break through the cordon set up by Russia around the gorge . Some 70 rebels are reported to have laid down their arms near Selmentausen on Monday , and federal forces are shelling Komsomolskoye in an attempt to oust their comrades . One officer nearby said as many as 50 Russian soldiers had been killed and others wounded since Sunday . Mr Yastrzhembsky said there were 1,500 - 2,000 fighters in the mountains , but could not exclude the possibility that up to 1,000 of these might have succeeded in escaping . Rebel tactics The BBC 's Jonathan Charles on the Chechen border says the security situation in the south is worsening and the rebels have adopted a new strategy of launching ambushes and guerrilla raids on Russian troops . Earlier , Russia cancelled Monday 's visit to Chechnya by representatives of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) , ostensibly because it could not guarantee their safety . Meanwhile , a report on Russian TV said paratroopers had stormed strategic heights above the Argun and Vedeno gorges on Monday , killing up to 50 rebels . Four Russian troops were killed . The push to take the gorges has exacted a heavy toll on Russian forces in recent days , although accurate casualty figures remain notoriously difficult to obtain . Mourning Russia 's leadership had said the gorge was under its control , but it was the scene of a bloody counter - attack over the weekend when rebels killed 31 paratroopers in fierce battles as they tried to break out into Chechnya 's flatland . The fighting - near Selmentausen , and a second village , Ulus - Kert - was the second major set-back for Russian troops in a few days after 20 soldiers were killed in an ambush near the Chechen capital , Grozny , last week . On Monday , Russians crowded into a church outside Moscow to mourn those victims . Acting President Vladimir Putin , whose popularity stems largely from his tough conduct of the war , will be hoping for swift progress in the operation to wipe out Chechen resistance ahead of a 26 March presidential election that he is expected to win .

( ERNEST LEBERECHT ) German astronomer , b. 4 December , 1821 , at ( Nieder - ) Cunnersdorf near L\u00f6bau , Saxony ; d. 16 March , 1889 , in Arcetri near Florence . Having lost his mother in early infancy , he was placed under a schoolmaster from his ninth to his fourteenth year , and employed as sexton , beadle , gardener , and collector of fees on occasions of New Year , of baptisms , and marriages . He then learned the art of lithography , and about his twentieth year , went to Copenhagen with letters of recommendation to a distant relative Lehmann , the father of the Danish statesmen and journalist , Orla Lehmann . During a three - years ' stay he was a welcome and frequent guest with a number of artists and academicians . The sculpture Reinhold carved his bust , and the painter Bunsen drew his portrait . His German poems to friends and benefactors show a complete mastery of his native tongue . He became enthusiastic over the literature and national songs of the Danes , and translated selections into German , e.g. , \" King R\u00e9n\u00e9 's Daughter \" . These three years in Denmark were , as he used to say , his academic career . With a desire to know peoples and countries from experience , he went to Christiania , but soon turned his path to the land of the fine arts . About 1850 he settled in Venice as lithographer . The Palace of the Doge seems to have attracted his artistic tastes , for he became intimately acquainted with the family of the Porter Gambin , whose daughter Marianna he married , embracing at the same time the Catholic faith . His wife testified that Tempel had never been satisfied with his former religion and purposely chose a Catholic companion in life . The marriage proved very happy , although not blessed with children . Contact with cultured people in Venice awakened in him a taste for astronomy . From his earning he bought a 4 - inch ( Stienheil ) comet -seeker , and in 1859 made two discoveries , one of a comet ( designated 1859 I ) , on 2 April , and another of the Merope-Nebula in the Pleiades , on 19 October . The new talent for discoveries matured in him the plan of embracing the astronomical career . In his enthusiasm he moved to Paris , but found that lack of scientific training precluded entrance to the Imperial Observatory . Greatly disappointed by Leverrier , the director , he moved with his wife to Marseilles in 1860 , where he was accepted by Benjamin Valz as assistant astronomer . Tempel began his career in Marseilles with the discoveries of a comet ( 1860 IV ) on 22 October , and of two minor planets on 4 and 8 March , 1861 , all with his own 4 - inch comet-seeker , on the terrace of the observatory . The position however lasted only half a year , owing partly , it would seem , to continued strained relations with Leverrier . He then settled down once more as lithographer without , however , giving rest to his comet-seeker . From window or garden he discovered , during ten years , no less than thirteen comets and four minor planets , more than half of them new . From Marseilles he began publishing his observations in the \" Astronomische Nachrichten \" . In France he missed cordial and intellectual intercourse , and a literary attempt of his in \" Les Mondes \" , in May , 1863 , on the question of the variability of nebulae , was severely criticized by Leverrier . In the same year ( 1863 ) he paid a two -months ' visit to his native country , spending most of the time at the observatory of Leipzig . Just two years before , in 1861 , a former astronomer of Leipzig , d'Arrest , had built a new observatory at Copenhagen . Unfortunately for Tempel , d'Arrest was the very one who criticized his publication on the Merope-Nebula as exaggerated , although the controversy ended in justifying Tempel 's assertion , that nebulae must be observed with low magnifying powers . Tempel 's effort , in 1870 , to get a position under d'Arrest was fruitless . In January , 1871 , the Provisional Government ordered the Germans out of Marseilles . In spite of his experiences in France , Tempel sympathized with the unfortunate country during the war . Arrived at Milan he found in Schiaparelli the man who appreciated his talents . Though he had no academic degrees , he was offered a position in the Brera Observatory . Two of Tempel 's comets had attracted Schiaparelli 's attention : that of 1866 ( I ) which furnished to him the proof of connexion with the November stream of meteors , and that of 1867 ( II ) which proved to revolve entirely between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter and to run almost parallel with the latter planet in 1869 , so as to furnish a type specimen of planetary perturbation . Comet \" 1869 III \" is called Tempel 's \" third periodic comet \" , but its periodicity was not recognized until 1880 . Four new comets were discovered in Milan . Comet \" 1873 II \" , called Tempel 's \" second periodic \" , is remarkable for the shortness of its period , being little over five years , and second only to Encke 's comet . Tempel 's publication in the Milan \" Ephemeris \" for 1872 shows that he reduced his own observations . His mind was sufficiently mathematical to acquire the use of logarithms and trigonometry and to draw elliptical orbits . Number V of the Brera Publications contain masterly lithographic plates of a lunar eclipse ( 1 June , 1863 ) , of the Merope-Nebula , of Jupiter 's satellites and a series of Coggia 's comet . A more perfect map of the Pleiades appeared in \" Monthly Notices \" ( XL , 1880 ) . Contact with Schiaparelli brought honours to Tempel . The Vienna Academy rewarded him four times for the discovery of comets , the two of 1869 discovered in Marseilles , and the two of 1871 . Once in 1872 , in the absence of the director , he received the Emperor of Brazil at the observatory , acted as cicerone , and presented some of his drawings . The year after , he received , through the Brazilian Consul , the diploma of \" Knight of the Imperial Brazilian Order of Roses \" . When , in 1873 , the Arcetri Observatory lost its director Donati , by death , Schiaparelli proposed Tempel as successor . The severe winters of Milan and the prospect of an independent position made it easy for Tempel to accept , although the unfinished state of the buildings and instruments , the title and scanty salary of assistant astronomer , the lack of library and assistants , were fraught with disappointments . After four years ' work in Milan ( 1871 - 74 ) Tempel moved to his last station , which he was to hold for fourteen years . He found the observatory situated in an earthly paradise . It was designed and commenced in 1869 by Donati , under the University of Florence , but interrupted in 1872 by Donati 's sickness . For two years it had been left in this state . The rain poured in on all sides and a wall of the meridian room had to be supported . A description of the observatory is given by Tempel in the \" Astr. Nachr . \" , CII ( 1882 ) . The predecessor of Donati , Amici , had constructed two object - glasses , one of 9.4 inches and one of 11 inches , large sizes in those times , but their mountings were imperfect and incomplete . The former had a wooden stand and could only be used on the terrace ; pointing to objects of over 40\u00b0 altitude was found dangerous . The mounting of the largest instrument was parallactic , but without divided circles , without clock - work , without clamp and slow motion . The observing chair was a ladder that did not reach to stars within 20\u00b0 of the horizon . Both instruments had only one eye-piece . The books present contained no star catalogues , and were lying on the floor . Money was still owing on the building , and no resources for the future open . The habitation was so defective that Tempel had to live in a neighbouring villa until his death . On examination the object - glasses proved a little defective in colour correction but excellent in definition ; hence less adapted for planets but perfectly suitable for comets , asteroids , and nebulae , the very programme of Tempel . Nebulae , however , became now his main field . In Arcetri he picked up only one more comet , \" 1877 V \" . The work with the large equatorial proved very slow and laborious . To find and to identify the stars , the observer had to descend from the ladder , use the comet-seeker on the terrace and make triangulations on the small charts at hand , all without electric light . And yet , after four years ' work , Tempel presented to the Royal Academy of the Lincei a collection of drawings of the more interesting nebulae , which secured him the royal prize given every six years for the best astronomical work in Italy . The Academy even offered to publish the drawings , but the proofs of the lithographs did not satisfy the author . The designs are the more valuable as they contain many stars , measured with a double ring -micrometer . Tempel discovered many new nebulae , observed a number that had been neglected since Herschel 's time , wrote a mass of careful notes that are not yet published , occasionally correcting errors . Extracts of his observations are found in the \" Astr. Nachr. \" ( vols. 93 - 113 ) . Drawings of the Orion nebula were published in the \" Astr. Nachr. \" , vol. LVIII ( 1862 ) , and in the Memoirs of the R. Bohemian Society of 1885 ( reviewed in the Vierteljahrsschrift , XXII ) . Tempel was elected foreign associate of the Royal Astronomical Society of England in 1881 , together with Gyld\u00e9n , Pickering , Tietjen , and Tisserand ( Monthly Notices , XLI , 377 ) . In 1886 he was honoured with a letter from King Humbert , handed to him by the Adjutant General , in recognition of his astronomical drawings . In the intercourse with scientific men , the lack of academic training betrayed itself occasionally , and Tempel himself regretted all his life that he had not learnt Latin . Diffusiveness of style and uncritical assertions provoked contradiction . A controversy with Dreyer , the astronomer of Birr Castle , about the reality of spiral forms in many of Lord Rosse 's drawings of nebulae , may be found in \" The Observatory \" ( vols . I - II , 1878 ) . The existence of a faint nebula drawn by Tempel ( near H. I 55 Pegasi ) was denied by Keeler ( Astroph . J. XI , 1900 ) . Tempel 's intercourse with old friends in Copenhagen remained cordial to his end . He received them or friends recommended by them , like brothers , and always regretted that his means did not allow him to revisit Copenhagen . His letters to them breathe a deeply religious spirit . He glories in his honesty from childhood , regrets complaining about injuries received , speaks of the blessings of Providence , of friendship beyond death , gives thanks and praises to God , promises prayers to friends and benefactors , and looks confidently towards eternity . Expressions like these made his Protestant friend say in the \" Dagbladet \" : \" During the many years ' sojourn in Italy his mind , which was subject to depressions , had found peace by entering the Catholic Church \" . The same friend assured the writer of this article that , on a visit to Arcetri , he had found Tempel very happy in his religious convictions . His dearest company was an old priest who visited him regularly . A Franciscan from the Convent of Quaracchi was his confessor , and the Carthusians of the Certosa were his friends . Towards the end of 1886 Tempel was attacked by a liver complaint and , in the beginning of 1887 , by partial paralysis . Unable to observe , he put his notes in order for publication . During his illness he received the sacraments repeatedly . The parish priest of S. Leonardo ( now Canon Emilio Nunziati ) testifies that Tempel was a thoroughly convinced Catholic and died a saintly death , having his mind clear to the last . Tempel was hardly sixty - eight years old . He is buried near the tomb of Donati , in the cemetery of S. Felice a Elma , a suburb of Florence . He left neither debts nor property , and his widow was provided for by what is called in Italy a \" spaccio di sali e tabacchi \" , this again , as it seems , through Schiaparelli . More than 186 drawings of nebulae and stars , with numerous notes , are now the property of the university and deposited in the Tribune of Galileo ( via Romana ) . A list of them is in the \" Aston . Nachr . \" CII ( 1882 ) , and in the \" Bohemian Memoirs \" ( 1885 ) . Dagbladet ( Copenhagen , 4 April , 1889 ) ; Monthly Notices R.A.S. , L ( 1890 ) , 179 ; SCHIAPARELLI , Astron .

But , unlike all the others , it also explains why . While the theory of surface reactions is still under active development , the approach Dr. Richard Masel takes in this book is to outline general principles derived from thermodynamics and reaction rate theory that can be applied to reactions on surfaces , and to indicate ways in which these principles may be applied . The book also provides a comprehensive treatment of the latest quantitative surface modeling techniques with numerous examples of their use in the fields of chemical engineering , physical chemistry , and materials science . A valuable working resource and an excellent graduate - level text , Principles of Adsorption and Reaction on Solid Surfaces provides readers with : * A detailed look at the latest advances in understanding and quantifying reactions on surfaces * In-depth reviews of all crucial background material * 40 solved examples illustrating how the methods apply to catalysis , physical vapor deposition , chemical vapor deposition , electrochemistry , and more * 340 problems and practice exercises * Sample computer programs * Universal plots of many key quantities * Detailed , class - tested derivations to help clarify key results The recent development of quantitative techniques for modeling surface reactions has led to a number of exciting breakthroughs in our understanding of what happens when gases come in contact with solid surfaces . While many books have appeared describing various experimental modeling techniques and the results obtained through their application , until now , there has been no single - volume reference devoted to the fundamental principles governing the processes observed . The first book to focus on governing principles rather than experimental techniques or specific results , Principles of Adsorption and Reaction on Solid Surfaces provides students and professionals with a quantitative treatment of the application of principles derived from the fields of thermodynamics and reaction rate theory to the investigation of gas adsorption and reaction on solid surfaces . Writing for a broad - based audience including , among others , chemical engineers , chemists , and materials scientists , Dr. Richard I. Masel deftly balances basic background in areas such as statistical mechanics and kinetics with more advanced applications in specialized areas . Principles of Adsorption and Reaction on Solid Surfaces was also designed to provide readers an opportunity to quickly familiarize themselves with all of the important quantitative surface modeling techniques now in use . To that end , the author has included all of the key equations involved as well as numerous real - world illustrations and solved examples that help to illustrate how the equations can be applied . He has also provided computer programs along with universal plots that make it easy for readers to apply results to their own problems with little computational effort .

Os imigrantes eram pessoas que possu\u00edam riquezas antes da guerra ou cidad\u00e3os com pouco dinheiro mas que estavam dispostos a empreg\u00e1 - lo na agricultura . \" Diferentemente do que se imaginava , a maioria deles era formada por pequenos propriet\u00e1rios \" , afirma Alessandra Zorzetto , que em sua tese de mestrado estudou a compra e venda de propriedades feita por imigrantes americanos , de 1865 \u00e0 1900 , na regi\u00e3o de Santa B\u00e1rbara D'Oeste , Americana , Campinas e Piracicaba ( cidades do interior de S\u00e3o Paulo ) . At\u00e9 1867 , cerca de 10 mil sulistas passaram a embarcaram nos portos de New Orleans , Charleston , Boston , Nova Iorque e outros , com destino a in\u00fameros pa\u00edses . Destes , 2.700 seguiram para o Brasil ( Tabela . 1 ) . Eles chegavam ao porto do Rio de Janeiro , depois de uma viagem que durava de 30 \u00e0 60 dias e , muitas vezes sem destino certo , ficavam hospedados na Casa do Imigrante . N\u00famero de americanos em janeiro de 1867 Esses estrangeiros se estabeleceram em v\u00e1rias regi\u00f5es do pa\u00eds , mas a maioria se encaminhou para o interior do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo , que contava com estradas de ferro ligadas ao porto de Santos o que facilitava o escoamento da produ\u00e7\u00e3o . De todas as regi\u00f5es que acolheram americanos , Santa B\u00e1rbara D'Oeste , cidade a 150 km de S\u00e3o Paulo , foi a que mais se desenvolveu . Os primeiros americanos a chegar l\u00e1 foram o Coronel William Hutchiinson Norris , ex-combatente da Guerra Civil Americana e ex-senador do estado do Alabama , e seu filho , que passaram a ministrar cursos sobre t\u00e9cnicas de cultivo de algod\u00e3o aos fazendeiros locais . Uma vez estabelecidos , receberam o restante da fam\u00edlia e outros conterr\u00e2neos . Segundo afirma a soci\u00f3loga Teresa Sales no artigo \" O trabalhador brasileiro no contexto das migra\u00e7\u00f5es internacionais \" contido no livro Emigra\u00e7\u00e3o e Imigra\u00e7\u00e3o Internacionais no Brasil Contempor\u00e2neo , as migra\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o se d\u00e3o de forma aleat\u00f3ria , mas se dirigem para certas \u00e1reas com as quais seu lugar de origem tem fortes la\u00e7os , que constituem redes sociais . Assim , um grupo j\u00e1 estabelecido pode ajudar aquele que acabou de chegar . Em Santa B\u00e1rbara D'Oeste , um grupo desses imigrantes se instalou ao redor da esta\u00e7\u00e3o ferrovi\u00e1ria e acabou dando origem a Villa Americana , que mais tarde se emanciparia formando o munic\u00edpio de Americana , hoje a 5 Km deSta. B\u00e1rbara . \" Os brasileiros foram muito generosos , dando - nos presentes e vendendo \u00e0 cr\u00e9dito , auxiliando os mais pobres a fazer a sua primeira safra \" O per\u00edodo de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o que se seguiu incluiu m\u00edmicas para se comunicarem com os brasileiros e empregados . Muitas vezes , no entanto , quem aprendia outra l\u00edngua eram os \u00faltimos . Algumas fam\u00edlias compraram escravos para ajudar na lavoura ou na cria\u00e7\u00e3o dos filhos , embora tenham aberto m\u00e3o destes em 1888 com a aboli\u00e7\u00e3o dos escravos . Outros retornaram ao seu pa\u00eds depois de dificuldades de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o . Muitos profissionais liberais como professoras , m\u00e9dicos e dentistas tamb\u00e9m emigraram dos Estados Unidos , trabalhando no com\u00e9rcio e trazendo conhecimentos e m\u00e9todos mais avan\u00e7ados . A introdu\u00e7\u00e3o do arado , ao inv\u00e9s da enxada usada pelos brasileiros , diminuiu o tempo de preparo do solo e aumentou a produtividade . Nas lavouras de algod\u00e3o foi adotada a t\u00e9cnica de rota\u00e7\u00e3o de cultura , alternando com o cultivo de milho e cana , para amenizar o problema de exaust\u00e3o do solo . Muitas vezes os americanos traziam sementes de diversas plantas como forma de trazer um peda\u00e7o de sua na\u00e7\u00e3o . Entre alguns exemplos est\u00e3o as melancias da Ge\u00f3rgia e a noz pec\u00e3 , hoje cultivada no sul do Brasil . Os americanos , protestantes em sua maioria , n\u00e3o podiam ser enterrados em cemit\u00e9rios cat\u00f3licos . Ent\u00e3o , passaram a ser sepultados em uma \u00e1rea de aproximadamente um hectare na fazenda da fam\u00edlia Oliver , hoje no Campo , h\u00e1 15 km do centro de Sta. B\u00e1rbara . Apesar de n\u00e3o cat\u00f3licos poderem ser enterrados em cemit\u00e9rios no Brasil a partir da \u00faltima d\u00e9cada do s\u00e9culo XIX , as fam\u00edlias americanas ainda preservam o Cemit\u00e9rio do Campo para enterrar seus descendentes . Algumas tradi\u00e7\u00f5es americanas foram , pouco a pouco , sendo absorvidas pela cultura local , mas outras foram incorporadas e difundidas pelo pa\u00eds . O famoso frango frito , a broa de milho , as panquecas , os waffles e as tortas doces e salgadas v\u00eam da cultura americana . Os edredons de penas ou de algod\u00e3o eram confeccionados pelas americanas que se reuniam para costurar e por as conversas em dia , enquanto seus maridos estavam no campo . Veja tabela 2 abaixo . A primeira gera\u00e7\u00e3o de americanos procurava conservar sua cultura , falando apenas ingl\u00eas e casando seus filhos com membros de fam\u00edlias americanas . A partir da terceira gera\u00e7\u00e3o , no entanto , os jovens que foram crescendo , mudavam - se para as cidades grandes em busca de continuar seus estudos . Alguns se aventuraram pelo nordeste e outros casaram - se com brasileiros ou outros imigrantes . Trimestralmente acontece em Santa B\u00e1rbara D'Oeste ( SP ) a Reuni\u00e3o da Fraternidade Descend\u00eancia Americana e , anualmente , acontece a festa dos descend\u00eantes no Cemit\u00e9rio do Campo , onde descendentes , do pa\u00eds inteiro , vestidos com roupas t\u00edpicas do sul dos E.U.A , se reunem para preservar suas tradi\u00e7\u00f5es . A pr\u00f3xima reuni\u00e3o ser\u00e1 no dia 08 de abril de 2001 , para maiores informa\u00e7\u00f5es consulte o Site da Fraternidade . Desde de 1988 foi organizado pela Prefeitura de Sta. B\u00e1rbara D'Oeste o Museu do Imigrante que possui uma se\u00e7\u00e3o sobre os imigrantes americanos , com exposi\u00e7\u00e3o permanente de objetos , documentos e fotos sedidas pela Fraternidade . O Centro de Mem\u00f3ria desta mesma cidade , arquiva fotos e documentos que podem ser consultados se segunda a sexta das 8 \u00e0s 12h e das 13h30 \u00e0s 17h .

Biography At the general election of 1820 Dashwood King was returned for ' the seventh time without opposition ' for Chipping Wycombe , which was on his doorstep at West Wycombe , though he preferred to live at Halton , near Wendover , eight miles to the north . 1 An independent Member , he evidently had no great interest in politics beyond his hostility to Catholic claims ; and in Buckinghamshire he was associated with the anti-Catholic Lord Chandos , one of the sitting Members and son of the pro-Catholic duke of Buckingham . When the other sitting Member decided to retire at the 1820 dissolution he alerted Dashwood King , who seems to have shown a fleeting interest in standing ; but he was reckoned to have ' no chance ' , and if his promotion of a county meeting was an attempt to impede the new Whig candidate Robert John Smith * , it was unsuccessful . 2 Dashwood King 's diaries , which survive for 1820 - 23 , 1827 and 1832 in this period , are a terse and almost entirely unreflecting record of his daily movements , revealing his variable attendance at the Commons , his personal piety and conscientious discharge of his duties as a magistrate , his abiding passion for hunting and shooting and the mounting financial problems which harassed and perplexed him . 3 He took his seat in the new Parliament on 9 May 1820 and attended fairly regularly that session , when his only recorded vote was against the Liverpool ministry 's appointment of an additional Scottish baron of exchequer , 15 May . He served on the Haddingtonshire election committee , 8 - 13 June , and was ' up all night ' in the House for the debate on Wilberforce 's motion for a compromise of the Queen Caroline affair , 22 June . 4 He spent two hours at the queen 's trial in the Lords , 25 Aug. 1820 , and was mostly at Halton for the rest of the year ; he leased West Wycombe in October . 5 After a brief visit to Brighton , Dashwood King attended the Commons to vote against government on the omission of the queen 's name from the liturgy , 23 Jan. 1821 , then ' came away early ' . 6 He had an operation ' for the cure of the hydrocele ' [ dropsy of the testicle ] , 31 Jan. , was ' severely ' stricken with ' gout ... in the stomach ' two days later and on 12 Feb . secured through Cockerell , Member for Evesham , a month 's sick leave . 7 He spent seven weeks at Brighton and another four at Halton before appearing in the House for an election committee ballot , 8 May . Resuming attendance later that month , he was in Hume 's minorities for ordnance reductions , 31 May , and divided against including arrears in the grant to the duke of Clarence , 8 June 1821 . At the end of the year he rented new London lodgings at 60 Conduit Street . 8 In August he had been obliged to turn down a request for money from his 31 - year - old eldest son George Henry Dashwood\u2020 : My own embarrassments are at this time great , insomuch that I have reduced my comforts with the hopes of overcoming them ; and which in two years as far as the extent of tradesmen 's demands I might accomplish provided further reductions in the value of lands and the prices of wood should not frustrate my exertions ... I have not been able to provide a carriage for your mother as usual ... and as much as in me lies , I shall avoid every uncalled for expenditure . 9 At the quarter sessions , 16 Oct. 1821 , he spoke and voted in the minority for placing official advertisements in the ' radical ' Buckinghamshire Chronicle . 10 Dashwood King was present when the Irish insurrection and habeas corpus suspension bills were rushed through the House , 8 Feb. 1822 , having moved into Conduit Street earlier that day . 11 He voted with government against more extensive tax remissions , 11 Feb. , but divided for reduction of the salt duties , 28 Feb. , and in the opposition majority for admiralty cuts , 1 Mar.12 He was at Halton from 8 Mar. until 22 Apr. , when he attended the debate on the state of Ireland . He thought Canning 's reply to Lord John Russell 's parliamentary reform motion ( which he presumably opposed ) , 25 Apr. , was 'as good a speech as ever I heard him deliver ' . He divided against Canning 's bill to relieve Catholic peers , 30 Apr. , 10 May . He was in the protectionist minority of 24 for a 40s . fixed duty on corn imports , 8 May.13 He attended spasmodically thereafter : he was in the House , for example , for debates on the Ionian Islands , 14 May , the aliens bill , 5 June , Scottish burgh accounts , 17 June , Irish tithes , 19 June , when he voted against inquiry , the influence of the crown , 24 June , and the slave trade , 27 June . He took a close interest in the Highgate chapel bill in July 1822.14 He was present for the king 's speech and the address , 4 Feb. , and on 21 Feb. 1823 heard Robinson , the new chancellor of the exchequer , open his budget . He did not attend again until 17 Mar. , being preoccupied with sorting out George Henry 's marriage settlement . On 26 Mar. he went with George Holford , Member for Queenborough , to inspect Millbank penitentiary . 15 He attended for Canning 's defence of ministerial policy on the French invasion of Spain , 14 Apr. , and an attack on the prosecution of the Dublin Orange rioters next day . He voted against ministers for inquiry into this , 22 Apr. , got ' home late ' from Russell 's reform motion , 24 Apr. , and was a regular attender for the following week . 16 After a spell in the country he resumed spasmodic attendance at the end of May : he voted against Scottish parliamentary reform , 2 June , but to recommit the silk bill and condemn misuse of the Barbados defence fund , 9 June , and with Hume for inquiry into the cost of the coronation , 19 June 1823.17 His only known vote in the 1824 session was against the beer duties bill , 24 May . At the Wycombe mayoral feast , 30 Sept. 1824 , following Chandos 's lead , he confirmed 'his objection to Catholic emancipation ' , but ' paid a high compliment to the labours of the Protestant Dissenters ' . 18 He divided for the Irish unlawful societies bill , 25 Feb. , and against Catholic relief , 1 Mar. , 21 Apr. , 10 May , and the Irish franchise bill , 26 Apr. 1825 . He voted against government on the duke of Cumberland 's annuity , 10 June 1825 . In 1826 he was in minorities against the emergency admission of warehoused foreign corn , 8 , 11 May . That month he agreed to rectify an oversight in the payment of George Henry 's allowance : I have bills to run for some time and from some of my principal tenants , which reduced my balance to a small sum . I endeavour to limit my expenses and those which depend upon myself are of small amount . Those I pay to my family [ are ] very large , and I have a narrow income left . I say this , to justify myself , for I do not know in what way I mismanage . 19 At the general election in June 1826 he was returned unopposed for Wycombe , where he emphasized his efforts to prevent interference with the corn laws . He was a guest at the dinner to celebrate the return of Chandos 's Whig uncle Lord Nugent for Aylesbury on ' constitutional principles ' , 10 July , when , on being toasted as 'one of the earliest friends and stoutest advocates of the principles of freedom of representation ' , he commented that if voters stuck to ' purity of election ' principles ' they would not have to fear the invasion of strangers , and would possess the privilege of selecting and electing their own representatives ' . He had nominated Chandos for the county , and duly chaired his celebration dinner , 17 Aug. 1826 , suggesting that constituents should ' treat ' their Members rather than the reverse . 20 Dashwood King heard Canning explain the ministerial plan for further relaxation of the corn laws , 1 Mar. 1827 , then attended for a week , voting against Catholic claims on the 6th .21 Resuming on 23 Mar. , he voted against the second reading of the corn bill , 2 Apr . He was occasionally present in May and June 1827 , but no votes have been found . 22 When Peel , home secretary in the new Wellington ministry and leader of the anti-Catholic Tories , sought his support in January 1828 , Dashwood King wished him ' success in your attempt to re-establish a government on those principles which are without doubt most approved of by the country ; 23 but his only known votes in the ensuing session were for repeal of the Test Acts , 26 Feb. , and against Catholic relief , 12 May . Planta , the patronage secretary , thought he would side ' with government ' for the concession of Catholic emancipation in 1829 , but , after defaulting on a call of the House , 5 Mar. , he divided against it , 23 , 30 Mar . He was not permanently alienated from the ministry and voted with them against the enfranchisement of Birmingham Leeds and Manchester , 23 Feb. , and for the grant for South American missions and against abolition of the death penalty for forgery offences , 7 June 1830 . He divided against Jewish emancipation , 5 Apr. , 17 May . He voted for an unsuccessful attempt to restrict the scope of the sale of beer bill , 1 July 1830 . After his unopposed return for Wycombe at the general election that summer , when he nominated Chandos , now an Ultra , for the county , 24 ministers listed him as one of the ' moderate Ultras ' , though he was regarded as essentially a ' friend ' . He was absent from the division on the civil list which brought them down , 15 Nov. 1830 . He was at this time plagued by the financial problems of his third son Edwin , an officer in the Blues , who was ' over head and ears in debt ' . 25 Dashwood King , who is not known to have spoken a word in debate during his Commons career of almost 35 years , presented a Bridgwater petition for reform , 21 Mar. 1831 . Next day , however , he divided against the second reading of the Grey ministry 's reform bill , as he did for Gascoyne 's wrecking amendment , 19 Apr. 1831 . His opposition to the measure cost him his seat at Wycombe , where he was execrated by the unfranchised residents and discouraged by most of the dominant Whig corporation from standing at the ensuing general election . He took the hint and retired . He again proposed Chandos , an anti-reformer , for the county . 26 At the 1832 county election , displaying ' an activity that surprised everyone ' , he sprang onto the table to answer an accusation that he had refused to contribute towards the cost of erecting a church in his parish with the boast that 'he and his family had built two churches , without any subscription at all being asked from any human being ' . 27 The last 18 years of his life were largely wretched . Edwin died in Paris in 1835 and his brother Henry , Dashwood King 's youngest son , had to resign his living at West Wycombe in disgrace over a sexual scandal . He died in February 1846 , six months before his married sister Elizabeth St. Leger.28 By then Dashwood King , whose wife had died in 1844 , was close to complete financial ruin . In 1847 his elder daughter Mary , whose profligate husband Augustus Berkeley had purloined all her money and impregnated a village girl , found bailiffs ransacking Halton and her father skulking in a hotel in Berkhampstead . 29 In 1848 Dashwood King put his affairs in the hands of trustees , who had great difficulty in persuading him to fulfil his ' promise ' to leave Halton for a frugal life in London lodgings . 30 He returned to Halton , where he died in October 1849 . By his will , dated 7 Aug. 1843 , he directed his trustees to raise from a leasehold estate held from the dean of Windsor annuities of \u00a3 400 for his second surviving son , the Rev. John Richard Dashwood , and his daughter Mary . He left his property at Chobham , Surrey , to one Agnes Erskine , who had been ' brought up by Lady Dashwood ' , and cleared this estate of all encumbrances by a codicil of 24 Apr. 1844 . By another codicil of 9 Feb. 1846 he stipulated that rents from his estates in Merionethshire and Montgomeryshire should be used to provide a \u00a3 200 annuity for Erskine ; and by one of 12 Mar. 1846 he directed that the contents of West Wycombe should be sold to liquidate debts on the Welsh property . His will was proved under \u00a3 7,000 , but the estate was ' insolvent ' and was left unadministered for seven years . 31 Dashwood King was succeeded in the baronetcy by George Henry , who was Liberal Member for Buckinghamshire , 1832 - 5 , and for Wycombe from 1837 until his death in 1862 , when it passed briefly to his brother John Richard .

As a fellow \" bomber \" says , Melbourne is a globally recognised Mecca for street art . It 's a veritable Louvre of urban expression ; a Hermitage of kerb-side creativity . The results range from irritating to inspiring . Imagination - deficient peacocks spend their time \" tagging \" , defacing surfaces with their self- aggrandising signature . But others use wit and visual flair to brighten sites that would otherwise be monochrome and depressing . These artists provide flashes of transcendence and beauty . As this fresh documentary from writer \/ director \/ producer Nicholas Hansen shows , fascinating work is being done under cover of the night . Ned Kelly 's head is being stencilled onto walls ; George Bush 's visage adorns a footpath beside the words \" Piss on Me \" ; and clever slogans are blooming , such as \" This wall has been intentionally left blank . \" Nearly all this street art is illegal - an issue underscored in the Victorian Government 's recent bid to clean up the city ahead of the Commonwealth Games . Which is n't right . When voracious developers are encouraged to deface Australia 's cities with ugly and isolating apartment blocks , it 's unfair to tell talented artists they ca n't beautify the city with their stencils , stickers , spray cans and humour . With the wonderful tagline \" Scratch it and it spreads \" , Rash was one of the audience favourites at last year 's Melbourne International Film Festival . Deservedly so .

And with the area now becoming home to a number of new towers , the older bank buildings that have long dominated Toronto 's skyline must work harder to compete for tenants . The new building will be named the Ernst & Young Tower and has attracted two high - profile financial tenants \u2013 E&Y and the TMX Group \u2013 that currently occupy a lot of space in older towers nearby . \" Ernst & Young is leaving one of the original bank towers , \" Michael Kitt , executive vice president of Oxford , which also has ownership stakes in older office buildings , said in an interview . \" The vacancy rate for new buildings , less than ten years old , is under two per cent downtown , whereas the rate for the rest of the buildings would be closer to five . So tenants really do appreciate the benefits of new space . \" He rattled off a list of features that new buildings have that are appealing : air quality , lighting controls bike rooms , change rooms , showers , high ceilings . \" As we have grown and diversified our organization , our efforts to integrate our acquisitions and optimize synergies have made clear the importance of a work space that fosters innovation and teamwork , \" TMX Group vice president Michael Vivaldi stated in a press release .

Do n't confuse this with the very similar looking Two Loop Shoelace Knot - the technique is quite different and much faster . It 's a truly revolutionary way to tie your shoelaces !| Please do n't be put off by these detailed instructions - even the Standard Shoelace Knot looks tricky when illustrated ! Give it a try ; you 'll find it 's easier than it looks . | Step 1 :| Tie a Left-over- Right Starting Knot as shown , then hold the laces as pictured . The right ( blue ) lace is held between the right thumb and forefinger whilst the left ( yellow ) lace is held around the left thumb and forefinger , using the other fingers of the left hand to hold the lace taut . | Step 2 :| This move creates two loops , one with the loose end behind , the other with the loose end in front . Use the middle finger of the right hand to push the loose end of the right lace behind , whilst the left hand simply rotates forwards to swing its loop across to the right . | Step 3 :| This next move crosses the two loops over each other . Use the left thumb to push its loose end over to the right , whilst the right middle finger continues to push its loose end all the way between the left thumb and forefinger to end up inside the left loop . Note that the diagram at left shows somewhat exaggerated crossed loops . They are really more \" alongside \" each other , which is difficult to illustrate . | Step 4 :| This tricky move requires each hand to use the two fingers inside its own loop to grab the loose end of the other hand 's loop . Use the left thumb and forefinger to grab the loose right end , then the right thumb and middle finger can grab the loose left end . | Step 5 :| This move sees each hand releasing its own loop and pulling the loose end of the opposite loop through its own . Take care not to pull the ends all the way through , as this will form a \" knot \" instead of a \" bow \" . In fact , this is a quick way to tie a starting knot ( though the finger movements must be reversed left to right or else it forms a Granny Knot ) . | Step 6 :| This final step simply completes the knot by pulling the loops tight . With practice , I can now tie my laces in about one third of the time of a conventional knot ! Note that you do not have to follow my instructions to the letter . So long as you retain the \" core \" of the technique , you are welcome to use whatever finger movements are most comfortable for you . | Finished Knot | | || The finished \" Ian Knot \" is identical to either the Standard Shoelace Knot or the Two Loop Shoelace Knot . Because it was tied much more quickly and symmetrically , the laces suffer less wear and tear and thus last longer . | | NOTE : If your finished knot comes out crooked , it 's probably because you tie your Starting Knot the opposite way to mine . This will result in an un- balanced \" Granny Knot \" , which both sits crooked and comes undone more easily . See my Slipping Shoelace Knots page for more information . |"},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Toomey offered examples of such instances where businesses serving the public should be allowed to discriminate , including a gym run by the Mormon Church , a Presbyterian - run retirement home , or a Jewish community center . Several Democratic senators took the floor in opposition to the amendment , noting that the chamber already approved language exempting faith - based organizations and clergy from ENDA 's discrimination protections . \" This amendment threatens to gut the central premise of ENDA , \" said Sen .

Nonetheless , certain design mistakes keep being made over and over again . Here are seven of the most common : 1 . Too much scripting Strategy games have a direct lineage from board games , and the fun of playing the latter comes from understanding the rules and mechanics of the game world and then making decisions that have consequence within that world . Computerized strategy games allow a single player to experience this same world on his or her own . At some point , however , strategy developers began to create lengthy , scripted scenarios as the single - player portion of their games ( In fact , the recent World in Conflict shipped without a single - player skirmish mode altogether ) . These scenarios have a peculiar feeling - they use some of the same rules as the core game while often violating others . The AI takes action depending not on its own development rate or strategic priorities but on whether the human has hit certain triggers . In many scenarios , in fact , the human cannot even lose because -- when defeat approaches -- the script will freeze the AI and starting pumping in free units for the player . Further , these scenarios are often built around specific \u201c objectives \u201d to achieve , such as destroying a specific structure or capturing a single point . This artificial environment takes decision - making away from the player . Not only is there only one path to victory , but the player 's performance along that path may not even matter . Games without interesting decisions get boring quickly . Fortunately , some recent strategy games , such as Sins of a Solar Empire and Armageddon Empires , have returned to open-world , random - map gameplay -- without pre-set objectives or artificial triggers -- and are reminding us of the joy of cohesive and consistent strategy games . 2 . Too much stuff The temptation to pile extra units and buildings and whatnot onto to an already complete design is strong . Indeed , I have seen many developers describe games as simply a collection of stuff ( \u201d 18 Weapons ! 68 Monsters ! 29 Levels ! \u201d ) . This approach is wrong - headed . A game design is a collection of interesting decisions , and the \u201c stuff \u201d in the game is there not just to fill space but to let you execute decisions . Games can provide too few options for the player but -- more commonly -- games provide too many . How many is just right ? Obviously , there is no magic number , but it is possible to come up with a good rule - of - thumb for how many different options a player can keep in his or her mind before everything turns to mush . Blizzard uses the number 12 to make sure their RTS 's do n't get too complex . StarCraft averaged 12 units per side . So did WarCraft 3 ( not counting Heroes ) . And you can bet that StarCraft 2 is going to be in that neighborhood as well . In fact , Blizzard has already announced that , for the sequel , they will be removing some of the old units to make room for the new ones . Players must be able to mentally track their in - game options at one time , and putting too many choices on the table makes it impossible to understand the possibility space . 3 . Limited play variety No matter how good your game , it is going to get stale after awhile . It 's unfortunate when a great game does n't take the few steps necessary so that players can change the settings to create alternate play experiences . Company of Heroes is an incredible tactical RTS , a watershed moment for the genre - but the game allows neither Axis vs . Axis battles nor matches with more than two teams . This design choice may fit the fiction of WWII , but it significantly reduced the game 's play variety . An example of an RTS that got this right is the Age of Empires series . Not only could you mix-and - match any combination of civilizations and players and teams , but you could also design your own map scripts . I remember one interesting Age of Kings map that had almost no wood but tons of stone and gold , which turned the game 's economy upside-down . The game even allowed multiple players to control the same single civilization ( one could control the military , the other the economy , for example ) . Thus , I 've played 2 - vs - 3 games of AoK where the sides with 2 civs was actually controlled by 4 players ( and , in fact , handily won the game ! ) . These simple variations probably doubled the life - span of AoK amongst my group of friends . Significantly , these options should be orthogonal to the game 's core mechanics -- they need to add variety without adding complexity . 4 . Black box mechanics Sometime during the late - 90's , around when Black & White was being developed , the concept of an interface - less game came into vogue . The idea was that interfaces were holding games back from larger , more mainstream audiences . Ever since then , I have noticed a discernible trend to hide game mechanics from the player . Age of Kings shipped in 1999 with an incredible reference card listing every cost , value , and modifier in the game . For modern RTS 's , however , it 's unusual if the manual actually contains numbers . I want to emphasize that the answer here is not to bathe the players in complicated mathematics in the name of transparency . Instead , designers should think of their interfaces as having two levels : a teaching level and a reference level . The teaching level focuses on first - time players who need to know the basics , like how to build a tank and go kill the bad guys . The reference level should answer any question the player can think of about how a game mechanic works . It is perfectly fine , by the way , to put this info inside of a separate in - game resource , like the Civilopedia . Rise of Legends implemented an interesting version of this two -interfaces idea . Most of the popup help in the game had an \u201c advanced \u201d mode that you could unlock by holding down a key , giving you significantly more details about the game 's underlying mechanics . 5 . Locked code \/ data Protecting your code and data is a very natural instinct -- after all , you may have spent years working on the project , developing unique features , pushing the boundaries of the genre . Giving away the innards of your game is a hard step for many developers , especially executives , to take . Nonetheless , we released the game \/ AI source code for Civ 4 shortly after shipping , and -- so far -- the results have been fantastic . Three fan - made mods were included in the game 's second expansion pack -- Derek Paxton 's Fall from Heaven : Age of Ice , Gabriele Trovato 's Rhye 's and Fall of Civilization , and Dale Kent 's WWII : The Road to War -- and so far , these scenarios have been heralded as one of Beyond the Sword 's strongest features . These mods would have been nowhere near as deep or compelling ( or even possible ) if we had not released our source code . For many PC developers , I 'm preaching to the choir , so I 'd like to be very clear that the problem is worst amongst strategy games . For whatever reason ( perhaps the lack of a pioneering developer like id Software ? ) , strategy developers have been much more closed off to modding than their shooter and RPG brethren . There are exceptions , like Blizzard 's fantastic scenario editor for WarCraft 3 , but by and large , strategy modders do not have many places to turn for platforms on which to work , which was one reason we felt compelled to focus on modding for Civ 4 . Giving stuff away can feel good . It should also feel smart . 6 . Anti-piracy paranoia The damage that piracy does to our industry is impossible to calculate but also impossible to ignore . Few company heads can be as brave as Stardock 's Brad Wardell , who chose to leave out copy protection altogether for the Galactic Civilization series ( They encourage paying customers by providing on - line updates to players with legitimate serial numbers . ) . Having some sort of mechanism to stop casual piracy is a given in the industry , but what is not a given is the hoops companies will make their customers jump through just to be able to start the game . The most important question to ask is \u201c will this added security layer actually increase our sales ? \u201d A good place to be lenient , for example , is with local multi-player games -- in other words , can players without the CD join a multi-player game hosted by a legitimate copy . Starcraft let you \u201c spawn \u201d extra copies of the game that could only join local multi-player games . Allowing unlimited LAN play was our unofficial policy for Civ 4 as well . The game does a disk check when opening the executable but not when you actually launch the game ; thus , a group of 4 friends could just pass one disk around for local multiplayer games . We do not believe players are willing to buy extra discs just for LAN parties , which are rare events . However , we would love for new players to be introduced to Civ in these environments , encouraged by their friends who are already fans . At some point , they are going to want to try single - player -- in which case , it is time for a trip down to the local retailer to buy their own copy . 7 . Putting story in the wrong places Story and games have a checkered history . Too many have suffered from boring cut-scenes , stereotyped characters , and plots that take control away from the player . Especially problematic are games which do n't let the player fast - forward through cringe- worthy dialogue . The worst offense , however , is when a story gets stuck somewhere it really does n't belong . Like in a strategy game . After all , strategy games are the original games . Humans first discovered gameplay with backgammon and chess and go ; it 's a noble tradition . The \u201c story \u201d in a strategy game is the game itself . Picking a specific example , how much better of a game would Rise of Legends have been if Big Huge Games had given up on creating a story - based campaign and instead iterated on the excellent turn - based Conquer the World strategy layer from Rise of Nations ? Ironically , the campaign mode was my favorite way to play RoL . I loved that you could only acquire technologies and advanced units on the strategic map between missions , which helped simplify the core RTS game . However , I enjoyed the campaign in spite of the story , not because of it . The key point here is that , for the sake of chasing a story , Big Huge Games missed a big opportunity to match a great core RTS game with a simple , overarching strategy layer that could be infinitely replayable . They are not alone ; almost every other RTS developer seems to be falling into the same trap , and it is time for this trend to stop ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Although historically there had been some interest in the albacore fishery from some charter vessels and a few private boats , the fishery really only began to see substantial growth after the year 2000 . Most catches in the recreational fishery occur seaward between 20 and 50 nautical miles from shore , with the albacore usually beginning to arrive in late June or early July and the fishing opportunity remains strong through late September in most years . Albacore caught off the Oregon Coast are younger aged fish ( usually 5 years or less ) and typically average 15 - 18 lbs with numerous fish into the mid 30 lbs landed each year by anglers off Oregon . Most recreational albacore tuna fishing has been by surface trolling jigs or plugs , but more recently anglers have been casting lures , angling with live bait , and even deep jigging . Good success can be had with all techniques . Due to the distance from shore and the highly variable and sometimes volatile marine fishing conditions off the Oregon Coast , this is a fishery that requires specialized boating and safety equipment and a good maritime knowledge base . The Ocean Recreational Boat Survey is part of the Ocean Sampling Project . The Ocean Sampling Project is made up of two sub-units : The Commercial Troll Salmon Project ( CTSP ) and the Ocean Recreational Boat Survey ( ORBS ) . ORBS collects the information needed to manage Oregons 's ocean sport fisheries , while the CTSP gathers needed information for management of the ocean commercial troll salmon seasons . Although the primary focus of the Ocean Sampling Project was originally for salmon management , it is the primary source of fishery information for the ocean recreational fisheries off Oregon . ORBS makes estimates of the angling effort and catch in the ocean recreational boat fishery . The ORBS estimates total ocean sport effort by boat type ( charter and private ) , and interviews are conducted randomly of ocean boats to generate estimates of catch for both salmon and non-salmon species . All sampled salmon are examined for the presence of a CWT . Additional biological data are collected from salmon and non-salmon species , and anglers are also interviewed regarding released fish species . The Ocean Sampling Project is staffed by a project leader and an assistant project leader at Newport , and two sampling coordinators ; one each at Tillamook and Charleston . The sampling coordinators serve as liaison between field samplers , fishery participants , and program staff at Newport ; deliver data and coded wire tags to Newport ; and also provide additional sampling when needed . We regularly sample fishery landings at all primary Oregon coastal ports , utilizing approximately 20 to 30 seasonal samplers .

After initial success in the 1980s \u2013 when their spidery , questing songcraft struck a popular chord \u2013 the English prog stewards survived the departure of original singer Fish in 1988 by rolling the dice on Steve Hogarth , who claimed to have never heard a Marillion album . Then , after a turbulent time in the 1990s , the band consciously uncoupled from the standard music business model in 2000 , embracing crowdfunding long before Kickstarter became cool . They have never looked back : next week they will play two nights at the Royal Albert Hall , their second visit in two years . But after cultivating such a fiercely loyal fanbase , is there a risk that a Marillion show in 2019 might resemble an AGM ? Not with Hogarth out front . For two hours , the swooping , self -dramatising singer strives to elevate every song into an epic \u2013 not difficult in the case of broiling opener Gaza , which rumbles and churns for 20 minutes \u2013 while also providing some appealingly frazzled between - song repartee and nipping off stage to change into a series of dystopian sci-fi jackets .

Early on , Ogelthorpe realized the importance of a marker on Tybee Island at the mouth of the river and ordered a 90 - foot , wooden structure be erected there . After construction on the tower had started , Ogelthorpe became upset at the lack of progress being made and jailed the head carpenter , threatening to hang him . The carpenter 's crew pled for his life , promising they could complete the tower in five more weeks . During the next sixteen days , they accomplished more than they had in the previous sixteen months . Apparently , government contractors earned their reputation centuries ago . The tower , used as a daymark for vessels entering the river , was completed in 1736 . The third tower rose to a height of 100 feet , was constructed of brick with wooden stairs and landings , and makes up the bottom section of the current Tybee Island Lighthouse . After Georgia ratified the Constitution in 1790 , the tower was ceded to the federal government . For the first time , the tower was outfitted with an official lamp . Candles with reflectors were first used atop the tower before being upgraded to whale oil lamps . A fifty - foot tower was built seaward of the lighthouse in 1822 , and an array of lamps in the shorter tower paired with those in the main tower functioned as a range light . As American lighthouses adopted the use of Fresnel lenses , the Tybee Lighthouse received a second - order lens in 1857 , while the front light was given a fourth-order lens . Now , instead of having to tend multiple lamps , the keepers were responsible for just a single lamp in each tower . The efficient Fresnel lens , with the single lamp at its center , greatly increased the range of the lights . In 1861 during the War Between the States , the Confederate forces abandoned Tybee Island for the safer confines of Fort Pulaski on Cockspur Island , roughly two miles upriver . Before retreating , the troops set fire to the lighthouse , burning the wooden stairs and landings . Union soldiers occupied Tybee Island and bombarded Fort Pulaski with newly developed rifled Parrot guns , prompting the surrender of the fort in just thirty hours . In 1886 , an earthquake , a rare occurrence for the east coast , struck the area . The annual report of the Lighthouse Board for 1887 summarized the damage to the Tybee Island Lighthouse : The earthquake of last August extended the cracks that have been observed in this tower for several years and made some new ones , but not to any dangerous extent . The lens was displaced and the attachments to its upper ring were broken . The damage was repaired without delay . The entrance for which the Tybee lights made a range \u2026 is gradually moving to the southward and in January last it became necessary to move the front beacon 98 feet in that direction . Electricity reached the lighthouse in 1933 , replacing kerosene as the light source . The staff at the lighthouse was reduced to just one keeper , George Jackson , who served until his death in 1947 . The Coast Guard , who took control of the tower in 1939 , occupied the station buildings until 1987 , when they moved to a modern facility on Cockspur Island . Otho O. Brown became office in charge of the Tybee Island Lighthouse in 1961 , and after two years at the station , he was paid a visit by Admiral Stephens , who had come to make an unannounced inspection . During Brown 's time at the lighthouse , he had put the station in sparkling condition . The masonry tower was completely scraped and repainted , inside and out , and Brown had participated in the development of a new prototype Light Attendant Station boat . Admiral Stephens commented to Brown , \" your leadership , initiative and enterprise are considered of the highest degree and your performance of duty is considered ideal . \" That was the first time the Admiral had used the word \" ideal \" to describe a man 's performance of duty . The lighthouse is still active , illuminating the skies above Tybee Island nightly with its first-order lens . In 1998 , the Tybee Island Lighthouse underwent a major restoration . The Tybee Island Historical Society had spent twelve years raising the nearly half a million dollars needed for the project . International Chimney Corporation of Buffalo , NY served as general contractor , and Scottish masons , Irish painters , and local craftsmen were recruited to work on the lighthouse . From 1970 through 1998 , the top half of the lighthouse was black and the bottom portion was white . When the lighthouse was painted as part of the restoration , the top and bottom portions of the lighthouse were painted black and the middle section white . The lighthouse had sported this particular daymark for more time than any other ( from 1916 to 1964 ) . To see a picture of the various daymarks used on the Tybee Island Lighthouse click here . The tireless efforts of the Tybee Island Historical Society were rewarded in 2002 when they received ownership of the station under the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act . The lighthouse was one of the first to be transferred under the act . Visitors to the Tybee Island Lighthouse today are treated to one of America 's most intact and historic light stations . The five - acre site is home to the lighthouse , a head keeper 's house built in 1881 , a first assistant 's house built in 1885 , a second assistant 's house built in 1861 , a summer kitchen built in 1812 , an oil house built in 1890 to house the volatile kerosene fuel , and a garage built in the 1930s . Following the renovation of the lighthouse in 1998 - 99 , the head keeper 's house was restored in 2000 - 01 , the first assistant 's dwelling was renovated in 2003 - 04 , and from 2005 - 08 attention was placed on the second assistant 's house , which was converted into a lecture hall , art gallery and audio-visual space . The Tybee Island Light Station is certainly one of the most complete and well - maintained stations in the United States .

Notes from a friend : Kraig writes : Located just seaward of the Tybee Island Lighthouse is Battery Garland of Fort Screven , which is now home to the Tybee Island Museum . Besides being a great place from which to photograph the lighthouse , the museum contains numerous exhibits detailing the history of Tybee Island . Fort Screven was built for the Spanish American War and was used until the end of World War II . Marilyn writes : We loved this lighthouse ! We spent so much time there both day and night that we could be docents . Seriously , it is worth the visit at night too . The fort is very cool too , but those people must have been darn short which did n't work well for me and barely did for Joanne . Joanne writes : Night and day , day and night , both are spectacular . Be sure to tour the fort as well and watch your head when going through the doors .

He was 28 years old and had lived most of his life in exile in France . With him were c.2,000 French mercenaries , funded by the King of France . Little more than a fortnight later , his supporters had defeated King Richard III at Bosworth , near Leicester , and he became King Henry VII . The Tudor dynasty which followed had a profound influence on Britain as we know it today . Why did Henry choose Mill Bay ? Familiarity was one reason . Henry was born in Pembroke Castle , on the opposite side of the Milford Haven waterway . His uncle , Jasper Tudor , was nominally Earl of Pembroke and had maintained contact with people in the area while bringing up his nephew in France . Another reason for choosing Mill Bay was to avoid detection by the king 's observers at Dale Castle , some 3 km further north . Inevitably , news of Henry 's landing travelled quickly \u2013 the king knew about it by 11 August . Crucially , however , the decision to land in this secluded bay allowed the fledgling army to come ashore unopposed . It was also imperative for Henry to start his march to Bosworth in a sympathetic region , because the army would quickly need provisions from supportive locals as well as extra soldiers from gentry who would rally to his cause . His strategy paid off , and he received a hearty welcome in Haverfordwest , the first major town on his route . His chief supporter in Wales was Rhys ap Thomas , whose homes included Carew Castle , near Pembroke . He marched across Wales via a different route to gather more soldiers for the battle . The story was later romanticised to portray Rhys standing at Mill Bay to welcome Henry . In 2004 the Pembrokeshire Marine Special Area of Conservation was designated , including the Haven . This aims to conserve the area 's exceptional marine wildlife while also supporting the waterway 's commercial and recreational activities .

A great believer in the capitalist enterprise , he was a keen , honest , and forthright negotiator who treated everyone equally and with dignity regardless of their circumstances . Albert passed away in 1997 at the age of 90 . Founders Albert and Ethel Herzstein were both children of pioneers . The family name \u2013 which ironically translates as \u201c heart of stone \u201d \u2014 is unique , originating only from the town of Thielen in Germany 's Westphalia region . Albert 's parents , Jewish settlers Morris Herzstein and Lena Goldsmith Herzstein , owned a successful mercantile store and built the first cinema in the remote town of Clayton , in far northeast New Mexico . Ethel Ann Avis was from Fulshear , Texas , about 30 miles southwest of Houston . Her family helped to establish the Fulshear United Methodist Church , which became one of the Herzstein Foundation 's early recipients . Born in 1907 in Trinidad , Colorado ( because his New Mexico hometown had no hospital ) , Herzstein came to Houston as an ambitious young man of 18 . It was 1925 , and he arrived with little more than a job offer from B.K. Smith 's small welding company . Within two years , he had married a woman he adored , Ethel Ann Avis , an operator at the Western Union office . Investing funds from the sale of Ethel 's Ford Coupe in 1930 , the entrepreneurial Herzstein helped build Smith 's company into an industry powerhouse . It eventually became Big Three Industries , then Air Liquide . The Herzsteins established their charitable foundation in 1965 on the advice of a banker friend who saw they had no children and a growing estate . He advised , \u201c Do n't give or throw away $ 1,000 here and there . Do it big , and put your name on it . That will be the footsteps you leave behind . \u201d Herzstein retired from Big Three in 1965 and established a thriving real estate business , Herzstein Investments , which eventually acquired more than a million square feet of warehouse space , debt free . The fortune \u2013 and the Herzstein 's philanthropy \u2013 grew . Among their large early gifts , the couple helped build Fulshear United Methodist Church for Ethel 's lifelong congregation . They also supported Al 's temple , Congregation Emanu - El , but they were more concerned with the principles of religion than theology . From its early stages , the foundation also provided important funds to Catholic organizations and numerous non-denominational institutions \u2013 the Chinquapin School , Houston Food Bank , the University of New Mexico and S.E.A.R.C.H. After Ethel died suddenly in her sleep in 1983 , her estate became the catalyst for larger - scale philanthropic programming . Sadie R. Smith , Al 's sister , contributed her estate in 1985 . Al 's generosity earned him numerous accolades in his later years . A Columbus Foundation selection committee consisting of Bill Moyers , Dr. Jonas Salk , and Marian Wright Edelmen gave him The American Philanthropist of the Year Award in 1993 . Shortly before his death , St. Thomas University awarded him an Honorary Doctorate . People often asked Herzstein why he was so generous . His answer , like his personality , was simple and to the point : \u201c Because I 'm the luckiest guy in the world . \u201d"},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Deeply discredited by China 's counterrevolutionary alliance with U.S. imperialism , demoralized facing the prospects of hard struggle in the Reagan years , American Maoism has come to the end of the line . A spectacular symptom : in the space of a couple of months this spring the two top dogs of New Left Maoism \u2013 Mike Klonsky and Bob Avakian\u2013suddenly departed from the scene . And speaking for those of us who have known these macho ego-tripping phonies since their days as anti-working - class SDS honchos , it could n't happen to a more deserving pair of jerks . A protracted upheaval in the slavishly Peking -loyal Communist Party Marxist - Leninist ( CPML ) has deposed the Klonsky Family regime while its central committee dissolved itself . Reportedly CPML members have been leaving in droves as an ongoing internal debate questions the very reason for existence of the group . Meanwhile Avakian , the lider maximo of the pro-\u201c Gang of Four \u201d Revolutionary Communist Party ( RCP ) , now facing a lengthy jail sentence on charges stemming from the RCP 's frenzied 1979 Chinese embassy attack , has fled to France where he is requesting political asylum . A signed editorial statement in the April issue of the CPML 's Call , entitled \u201c The Crisis in Marxism and M-L Unity , \u201d begins starkly : \u201c Any reader of the last few issues of The Call can plainly see the CPML is in the midst of a serious ideological , political and organizational crisis . \u201d Its one - sentence summing up indicates the rightist thrust of all sides in the dispute : \u201c The basic reason for this crisis is the ultra-left orientation , line and method that held back the CPML 's development from a small sect into a political force in the United States . \u201d \u201c Ultra -left \u201d ?! On every key international issue the Peking Stalinists stand to the right of the liberal bourgeoisie . From Angola to Afghanistan , they saw their task as stiffening the resolve of Western imperialism to fight the \u201c main enemy , \u201d Russian \u201c hegemonism . \u201d And as this role as anti-Soviet Cold Warriors increasingly turned U.S. Maoists into despised sects , the crisis set in . Beginning last year , the CPML began publishing fundamental self - criticisms rejecting its whole previous \u201c party-building \u201d line and denouncing its orientation in the unions as \u201c sectarian . \u201d The Call lost its Spanish -language section , El Clarin , went from weekly to monthly , changed its masthead from \u201c Organ of the Communist Party Marxist - Leninist \u201d to \u201c Voice of Socialism in the United States . \u201d In March came the laconic announcement that \u201c the chairman resigned his position . \u201d Citing \u201c organizational disintegration , \u201d the CPML reported that an emergency delegates conference had been held where an Interim Political Committee was formed and the question of party liquidation was openly debated : \u201c For example , many CPML members feel our mistakes of sectarianism flowed from our conception of ourselves as the vanguard party . But there is disagreement over whether the whole concept of vanguard party is invalid or whether it was misapplied \u201d ( \u201c CPML Holds Special Meeting to Rebuild Organization , \u201d Call , March 1981 ) . Indeed , outright dissolution of the CPML is not out of the question , as a number of leading members have since quit heading in the direction of mainstream social democracy . What is going on in the \u201c official \u201d U.S. Maoist organization ? In the welter of documents and letters , the frankest piece was \u201c A Message to the Movement \u201d ( Call , February 1981 ) by former staff writer Jim Hamilton . After years of double - talk Mao-think jargon , Hamilton 's piece is a straight out call for American nativist populism . In the face of the rightward shift in U.S. politics signaled by the Reagan election , Hamilton speaks for demoralized New Lefters who see the CPML 's prospects drying up and want to throw in the towel as a \u201c vanguard \u201d tendency . Instead they hanker after the old \u201c movement \u201d they used to know . Hamilton 's indictment : Nearly ten years of difficult and dedicated mass work by our hundreds of cadres has yielded little result in terms of building a truly mass revolutionary movement . Neither our press nor our political approach has really ' caught on ' among any significant section of the population , and they show no signs of doing so unless fundamental changes are made in our work . Our membership has declined by several hundred over the past two years ... Basically , Hamilton says they were wrong to form a party at all : ... it is evident that our conception of a single , vanguard communist party playing the only leading and revolutionary role in society was more than a little to blame for our hegemony - seeking and for the poor state of our united front work . Furthermore , the notion that the CPML was that vanguard party only added to the problem . [ emphasis in original ] Hamilton rips the CPML 's \u201c disdain for electoral work \u201d and the \u201c apocalyptic vision of the U.S. revolution \u201d rooted in \u201c the anti-Marxist notion that armed struggle is the only strategic component of the revolutionary seizure of power . \u201d The \u201c Chilean experience , \u201d he writes , must be reinterpreted in the light of a \u201c possible parliamentary transition . \u201d Shades of Khrushchev ! But in reality , Hamilton 's main line is in the direction of American national - reformism : \u201c Is n't there something wrong when many in our movement know the names of Chinese officials but not the names of their own Congressmen ? \u201d The message of \u201c A Message to the Movement \u201d is nativist populism : The New Right , for instance , is a real phenomenon , reflecting not only the latest shift in ruling class policy but also the fact that racists and reactionaries have often spoken to the people 's genuine fears and frustrations better than we have . Hamilton wants to beat the right - wing populists at their own game . For him and many others in the CPML , the \u201c left \u201d should lead the racist \u201c tax revolts \u201d instead of the likes of California state senator Howard Jarvis . Following the logic of his positions , Hamilton has since quit the CPML , along with former Call editor Daniel Burstein . Others who support this line are talking about a fusion with Michael Harrington 's Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee ( DSOC ) , a pressure group for Kennedy liberalism , and the slightly less openly pro-Democratic Party New American Movement ( NAM ) . While Hamilton 's \u201c Message \u201d was openly liquidationist , the response of the Interim Political Committee was hardly less so . The differences were over how the CPML should be liquidated . While the dissidents want to merge outright with the social democrats , the leaders of the rump organization long for the amorphous New Left that was their breeding ground in the late ' 60s . This perspective is spelled out by the editorial in the April Call signed by PC spokesman John Martin : The CPML 's self - conception of being the vanguard party undoubtedly caused difficulties in uniting with other organizations . Further , the organization that will be formed through any merger will approximate a pre-party organization and not the party itself . [ emphasis in original ] The main targets of this pitch for good old \u201c M-L unity \u201d are Mickey Jarvis ' Revolutionary Workers Headquarters ( a split from Avakian 's RCP ) and the West Coast - based League of Revolutionary Struggle ( Unity ) group . Among their numerous mea culpas for \u201c ultra-leftism , \u201d both CPML leaders and dissidents single out their ineffective policies in the labor movement going back to the days of Klonsky 's October League ( OL ) . An article last year , \u201c Summing Up the Party 's Trade Union Work , \u201d states : The most vivid example of the practical results of incorrectly aiming the main blow ( with a particular emphasis on attacking the most social democratic union officials ) was our boycott of the Sadlowski election in the Steelworkers union . \u2013 Call , 9 June 1980 Back in 1977 , the Klonskyites accurately called liberal bureaucrat \u201c Oilcan Eddy \u201d an \u201c Opportunist Out of Office . \u201d But as we pointed out then ( see \u201c Maoist OL Somersaults Over Sadlowski , \u201d WV No. 144 , 11 February 1977 ) , this refusal to support a liberal bureaucrat - on - the - make was only a momentary aberration for these Mao-Stalinists . More representative of the practice of the OL \/ CPML was their craven support to the bureaucratic Brotherhood Caucus in the Fremont ( California ) United Auto Workers . Here their only deviation from mainstream labor reformism was to initiate an anti-union court suit for \u201c super-seniority \u201d for women and minorities ( in reality a call for \u201c preferential layoffs \u201d of white , male fellow workers ) . But the real source of the near-terminal crisis of American Maoism is not that it did n't sell out enough in the domestic class struggle . At that level , they were certainly on a par with the reformist Communist Party and Socialist Workers Party . The specific origins of the Peking Stalinists ' decline are to be found in their links to the ruling bureaucracy of the Chinese deformed workers state and its deepening alliance with U.S. imperialism . For years , Peking -loyal Maoists tried to disguise China 's support for NATO with Mao-talk about Russia as the \u201c main enemy . \u201d And now that their isolation has reached catastrophic proportions , one would never know from the documents of the current explosion in the CPML that Klonsky & Co. ever had anything to do with \u201c People 's China . \u201d But the Chinese connection is there . Both sides try to distance themselves from some of Peking 's most rabid anti-Soviet theses . Hamilton writes , \u201c Is n't there also something wrong when we insist on describing the Soviet Union as ' capitalism restored even though no one in our movement can offer a coherent proof of that contention ? \u201d Martin , for the Interim Political Committee , talks of a need to \u201c reassess \u201d the \u201c change of tactics of the USSR internationally \u201d : \u201c This new left posture of the Soviet social imperialists , along with the Chinese experience of the Gang of Four and their internal influence , show that revisionism today comes from the left as well as the right . \u201d The idea of Brezhnev as an ultra-left is absurd , but it does indicate some awareness by the CPML leaders of their own position in far right field . Obviously , they are worried that their hundreds of ex-members ( and many who have stuck it out this far ) may be attracted to the so-called \u201c anti-revisionist , anti-dogmatist Trend \u201d which has lately been picking up disoriented former New Left Maoists ( see \u201c Where is the ' Trend ' Going ? \u201d WV No. 273 , 30 January ) . As we pointed out , the main line of the Trend is slouching towards Moscow as these perennial fellow travelers oscillate from one Stalinist bureaucracy to another in the eternal search for the popular front . But even \u201c critical Brezhnevism \u201d may look a lot more appetizing than supporting the CIA - backed 1975 South African invasion of Angola and China 's 1979 attempt , in collusion with U.S. imperialism , to teach Vietnam a \u201c bloody lesson . \u201d From the time Klonsky 's OL and Avakian 's Revolutionary Union ( RU ) were squabbling over the fallout products from the 1969 split in SDS , the two have feuded over who would be Numero Uno in the New Left Maoist milieu . By the mid-1970s the OL \/ CPML 's main claim to fame was its recognition by Peking . Avakian 's RU \/ RCP lost out in the battle for the Chinese franchise , and following Mao 's death supported the \u201c Helmsma n 's \u201d widow Chiang Ch'ing and her \u201c Gang of Four \u201d deposed by Hua and Deng . But Klonsky 's well - photographed handshake with Hua did n't catapult him into the big time\u2013if anything , it had the opposite effect . So not surprisingly the RCP is gloating over the current tribulations of their archrivals : ... the Chinese had made their own belly crawling peace with U.S. imperialism and penny ante parties were an embarrassment to them at best ... Thus , Klonsky 's magic carpet franchise of tailing after the Chinese revisionists , upon which he staked his own career and the prestige of his organization , was pulled out from under . \u2013 \u201c The Rocks the CPML is Crashing On , \u201d Revolutionary Worker , 3 April The Avakianites are hardly in a position to crow , however . Their own adventurist antics have landed them in a heap of trouble which could spell curtains for the RCP . It 's been a while now since this crazed leader cult went off the deep end . To the accompaniment of Avakian 's clanking bullet necklace , punk Maoist RCP youth brigaders went wild in the streets : Weatherman - style high school \u201c breakouts , \u201d arrests for planting their miniature red flags atop the Alamo . Building for its Mayday 1980 happening , the Avakianites pulled scores of cadres out of the factories chanting , \u201c Chairman Bob is our leader , Long live the RCP ! \u201d In LA , this craziness took on tragic dimensions as RCPer Damian Garcia was stabbed to death and two others injured in a confrontation in Pico Gardens housing project . There was the United Nations stunt , when the Avakianites drenched U.S. and Soviet deputy delegates with red paint . But the most dramatic was a pistol - waving assault on the Chinese embassy in Washington in January 1979 protesting the U.S. visit of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping ( Teng Hsiao - p'ing ) . After a lower court had dismissed charges , on appeal federal prosecutors won reindictment on charges which could total 241 years imprisonment for Avakian and 16 other \u201c Mao Tse-tung Defendants . \u201d Sizing up the meaning of Reagan 's election , the RCP Chairman fled to France . That Avakian ran to Paris rather than to someplace like \u201c socialist Albania \u201d is about the only sign of sanity in this whole insane affair . At the time that the more staid Jarvisite pro-China reformists split from the Avakianites three years ago , we wrote : An unstable , demagogic tendency , the Avakian faction is capable of both extreme adventurism and slavish capitulation to the worst backwardness of the working class . The post-split RCP will likely be simply a personality cult , crassly opportunist , violently sectarian and programmatically extremely unstable . It could go anywhere\u2013from trying to seize Solidarity House to blocking with the Ku Klux Klan ( as it did in hailing the anti-busing mobilizations in Boston and Louisville as ' fightback ' ) . \u2013 \u201c RCP Splits ! \u201d WV No. 190 , 27 January 1978 This has certainly been borne out as the RCP has gone every which way but loose . While the CPML harks back to early New Left social - democratic populism , the RCP is reverting to a Weatherman period . With Avakian and Klonsky out of the picture , who 's left in the Maoist firmament ? Jerry Tung 's Communist Workers Party ( CWP ) , once the most obscure of obscure Mao sects , was thrust into national attention as a result of the brutal November 1979 Greensboro KKK \/ Nazi massacre of five CWP workers . As the CPML falls apart and the RCP parades around cloud - cuckoo land , the CWP appears as the only run-of - the- mill Maoist group on the scene\u2013yet the Tungites are plenty out of kilter themselves . In the case of the NASSCO 3 , unionists at a San Diego shipyard trapped in frame - up bomb charges , CWP supporters could n't differentiate between union militants and a well - known provocateur who goes around talking of blowing up power stations . The CWP ( \u201c Gang of Four \u201d supporters who split from Progressive Labor in the early ' 70s ) , like many Maoist cult \/ sects , has been known for its wild gyrations between adventurism and opportunism . Following its \u201c Death to the Klan \u201d confrontations in the South and the tragic assassination of the Greensboro martyrs , the CWP has swung sharply to the right , trying to gain broad support through building popular fronts with the bourgeoisie . Last year they accurately labeled the National Black Independent Political Party as a bourgeois trap , while today they are beating the drums for the NBIPP . Now we learn that CWPers are not only attending church regularly but are teaching Sunday school . We also hear on the grapevine that Jerry Tung changed his line on the Russian question six months ago , though nothing has been said in public as yet . Most likely the CPML and RCP will not long survive the departure of their respective maximum leaders . More importantly , this dramatic double - exit throws a sharp light on the death throes of American Maoism . As we noted a year ago , when the Maoists were beating the drums for Carter \/ Brzezinski 's Cold War frenzy over Afghanistan : The rapprochement of China with American capitalism has demonstrated that the Maos and Dengs , under the guise of building ' socialism ' in their country are as willing to sell out revolution as the Stalins and Brezhnevs\u2013and prepared to join a global counterrevolutionary alliance with the main imperialist power , aimed at breaking the strength of the main anti-capitalist power ( the Soviet Union ) , besides . Increasingly confronted by the reality of these betrayals , the Maoist movement has degenerated into a collection of politically irrelevant sects like Progressive Labor , macho cults like Avakian 's RCP , or open apologists for U.S. imperialism a la Klonsky . \u2013 \u201c Maoists United with Uncle Sam , \u201d WV No. 250 , 22 February 1980 How , then , can you fight draft registration , initiated by Jimmy Carter as part of his anti-Soviet war drive , if like China and the CPML you actively support CIA - backed feudalists in Afghanistan ? It 's no accident that in the last year the Klonskyites have waffled all over the map on military conscription for the imperialist war machine . Responding to the same Cold War pressures , the Stalinists - without - a- country of Progressive Labor have recently come out for volunteering for the U.S. army ( see \u201c PL ' Picks Up the Gun ' for Uncle Sam , \u201d Young Spartacus No. 91 , May 1981 ) . Or what about El Salvador ? At the May 3 Salvador demonstration in Washington , far and away the largest protest of this kind since the Vietnam War , the CPML was nowhere to be seen while the RCP 's presence was minimal . The only exception was the CWP , with Tung speaking at the reformist \/ liberal PAM rally . The reason for the Maoists ' embarrassment is obvious . How can they unequivocally oppose the bloody U.S. - backed Salvadoran junta without being seen as aiding \u201c Soviet social - imperialism \u201d ? Thus Avakian 's Revolutionary Worker ( 27 March ) warns : \u201c None of this implies that the Soviet Union is giving up and just leaving Central America to the U.S.\u2013far from it . In fact , it is preparing to make a grab for it in the future while attempting to increase its influence in the region . \u201d At the May 3 protest it was the right - wing Reaganite counterdemonstrators who chanted \u201c End Soviet imperialis m \u201d and \u201c USSR and Cuba out of El Salvador . \u201d Aside from the specifically Maoist aspects of their present crisis , what is going on with the CPML and RCP more generally reflects the response of ex - New Lefters to their stagnation and decline during the dog days of the late 1970s . They yearn for the late ' 60s , when they had a mass audience . But where the New Left moved from social - democratic populism to the left\u2013from cheers for Kennedy 's \u201c New Frontier \u201d and \u201c part of the way with LBJ \u201d to \u201c Ho , Ho , Ho Chi Minh , NLF is gonna win \u201d \u2013 now many Maoists are looking for a populist road out of their present isolation by competing with Reaganism on its own terrain of racist reaction . Following ex- New Left honcho Tom Hayden , now a loser Democratic Party politico , CPML leader Lyn Wells declared at an anti-KKK conference this January : \u201c Why does [ California senator ] Jarvis have to lead a tax movement ? Why ca n't we lead one ? \u201d Why not ? Revolutionary socialists have no program for how the capitalist state should finance its programs ; generally we abstain on tax referenda , pointing out that tax cuts are almost always followed by wage - cutting inflation . But the present tax revolt is really the \u201c white backlash \u201d at one or two removes\u2013a racist middle - class mobilization to cut back social services in general and especially government aid to minorities , the unemployed and poor . Perhaps the CPML 's next slogan will be , \u201c They say cut back ! We say cut back ! \u201d We are witnessing the final demoralization of the \u201c classless \u201d New Left . As the CPML Interim Political Committee noted about its own crisis : \u201c All this was happening at a time when the right wing was on the warpath and Reagan galloped into office . \u201d Lacking a proletarian Bolshevik program enabling them to swim against the stream , the degenerated Maoists want to go with the tide of reaction . The response of the Trotskyist Spartacist League is quite the opposite . In a recent forum , SL central committee member George Foster warned about political dives by so-called leftists in the face of Reagan reaction : We 're going to see other stuff , too , a loss of nerve and a loss of will . Which is going to find a program : run and hide , drop out . Suddenly Michael Harrington and DSOC seem to be the wave of the future\u2013right ? \u2013 we 'll work in the Democratic Party . That stuff is going to find a program . \u2013 \u201c Facing the Reagan Years , \u201d WV No. 273 , 30 January The disintegrating New Left Maoists have found this program . As some of these big-talking hotshots flee for asylum , others seek refuge in the Harrington \/ Kennedy camp of Democratic Party liberalism and still others are heading down the road of American nativist social - populism . Unlike these impressionistic and weak - willed petty-bourgeois radicals , as Marxists we understand that the popularity of the Reagan \u201c honeymoon \u201d is superficial . The war drive against the Soviet Union and the drive to step up the exploitation of American workers , intensifying virtually every form of social oppression , will produce a new wave of class struggle . And the Trotskyists will be there fighting to lead the working class and its allies to power ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

File photo : The Associated Press Emphasis on thin is a heavy burden Pressure on female gymnasts to reach the elite level can start a painful slide toward health issues later in their lives . A few days before Christy Henrich died in 1994 , her 4 - foot - 11 , 95 - pound frame had shrunk to 47 pounds . Henrich died from multiple organ failure stemming from her eight - year battle with eating disorders , a battle that her family said began shortly after she joined the U.S. national team in 1986 . \" The first thing ( other athletes ) told her was if there 's something you want to eat , eat it and throw it up , \" Henrich 's mother Sandy recalled . \" That 's the first thing you learn when you 're on the U.S. national team . \" A decade later , American women 's gymnastics has failed to learn the lessons of Henrich 's death , former U.S. national team members and longtime observers of the sport said . The Register interviewed nearly half of the roughly 300 women who competed on the U.S. junior or senior national teams from 1982 to 2004 . The women portray a sport whose obsession with weight and diet , especially within the U.S. national team program , continues to lead to eating disorders . But top coaches and USA Gymnastics officials disagreed . \" There are people with emotional disorders in every walk of life , \" said Don Peters , 1984 Olympic coach . \" If gymnastics caused eating disorders , then everyone in gymnastics would have one . \" Bela Karolyi , renowned coach of Nadia Comaneci and Mary Lou Retton , agrees with his old rival . \" The nutritional issue is long over , \" Karolyi said . \" We 've had our big hoopla due to the Christy Henrich situation . That was such an isolated thing , bless her heart . \" Ever since Olga Korbut revolutionized gymnastics at the 1972 Olympics , the prepubescent waif has been seen as the sport 's ideal body type . Girls training under Karolyi and his wife , Martha , were restricted to as little as 900 calories daily , said 1996 Olympic champion Dominique Moceanu , who trained with them for five years . \" We sat with Martha and Bela at breakfast , lunch and dinner , \" Moceanu said . \" They were very strict . They measured everything . \" Karolyi said the nutritional practices were healthy and he believes the more girls weigh , the more vulnerable they are to injury . USA Gymnastics now has a nutritionist during training camps at Karolyi 's ranch . U.S. champion Alyssa Beckerman said on trips to competitions her coach \" checked our hotel trash cans to make sure we were n't eating anything . \" The sport 's preoccupation with weight is drilled into gymnasts at an early age . Gymnasts as young as 5 are weighed daily . Some elite gymnasts said they were weighed twice a day by their coaches . Dozens of women recalled their coaches calling them names such as \" pig . \" When that happened to Patti Massoels , a national team member during the 1980s , she weighed 90 pounds and said she was living on two graham crackers a day . Gymnasts not making prescribed weights receive punishments ranging from the withholding of food to being required to do extra workouts , gymnasts and parents said . It is not uncommon for penalized gymnasts to work out in saunas wearing rubber suits . At one gym , the practice is referred to as the \" Oink Olympics . \" Veteran coaches such as Tom McCarthy said there are good reasons for the sport 's obsession with weight . \" We have to practice flying a lot - that 's how you get good , \" McCarthy said . \" If you are even a few pounds above the best weight for your size and you keep taking landings , it 's going to take a toll on your physical being . \" The competitive environment , the gymnasts ' youth and their driven personalities put them at high risk for eating disorders , according to Ron Thompson , co-director of an eating - disorder program at Indiana 's Bloomington Hospital . \" These kids are so mentally tough , so willing to do anything the coach says will make them a better athlete . They 're perfectionists , \" said Thompson , who has studied the issue for two decades . \" So continuing to train on broken bones and having eating disorders is normal behavior to them . \" In some cases , gymnasts without eating disorders are looked down upon by teammates and coaches for not being committed enough to the sport , according to medical experts and dozens of gymnasts interviewed . \" A lot of the national team had eating disorders in some way or the other , \" said Kim Arnold , a U.S. team member in the 1990s . \" There was a lot of eating and purging . You used to see how little you can eat today and still get through a workout . \" We used to see how many meals we could miss before we had to eat again . \" Recent U.S. team members estimate that as many as 80 percent of gymnasts currently competing at the elite level have some form of eating disorder . Some coaches think the number is even higher . \" I 'd say 100 percent of them have some kind of food issue , \" said Suzanne Yoculan , a University of Georgia coach . Poor nutrition makes athletes more susceptible to injuries and can delay or interrupt menstruation . Previous research has shown that some gymnasts do n't start menstruating until they are about 15 . But dozens of gymnasts said they did n't start menstruating until their late teensor early 20s . Some said their cycles were interrupted from their mid-teens until their 20s . The weight loss from a combination of eating disorders and training long hours leads to decreases in estrogen , the hormone that helps regulate the menstrual cycle , and can be the first step in what doctors call the \" female athlete triad . \" In women whose body fat drops below 17 percent , the decreases in estrogen can lead to the triad 's second step , irregular or complete lack of menstruation . The low estrogen levels can lead to the third facet of the triad - osteoporosis . The weakening of bones due to loss of bone density and improper bone formation makes women susceptible to fractures . \" I got my period when I was 13 , \" said Sandy Sobotka , a U.S. team member in the 1980s . \" At the time I had mono ( mononucleosis ) and could n't train . Then I started training again . My period did n't come again until I was 21 . \" Contact the writer : ( 714 ) 796-5021 or sreid@ocregister.com"},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Its uses span from tsuka making to sliding panel shoji and it particularly shines in joinery where it serves as a lubricant when inserting tenons as well as the adhesive to keep them in place . One of its advantages is that , unlike most synthetic wood glues , it is reversible by steaming or splitting when repairs are needed . Some of the reasons rice glue was specifically chosen for making tsuka is that it is non-acidic , does not degrade either the steel or the wood over time , and does not retain moisture . Another is that , while quite strong , it is closer in strength to the wood itself . This allows a scabbard or handle to be split open for major cleaning or repair with minimal damage to the wood . Sokui Ingredients This all natural glue contains nothing but delicious Japanese rice and a little bit of extra water . The saying is that the most delicious rice makes the best glue . Some also say that yesterday 's rice makes a better glue than today's . I have found that most any steamed white Japanese short - grain rice works well . Whole grain ( brown ) rice tends to have pieces of husk that can interfere with creating a tight , seamless joint . Rice that has been mixed with vinegar in preparation for making sushi should be avoided due to the acidity . How to Make Sokui A bite or two of cooked rice is placed on a board and worked with a bamboo or wooden wedge to break all the grains into pulp . As the rice is squeezed under the wedge it becomes like sticky dough . Once there are no pieces or lumps left , a few drops of water are worked in to bring the glue to the desired consistency . It is important to do all of the mashing before adding any extra water or the lumps will be very hard to remove . When adding water , do it only a drop or two at a time to prevent over dilution , if things go wrong it is often easier to start over than to rescue a watery batch . The main consideration when making sokui is to take enough time when mashing . Once everything seems fully smooth and uniform , continue mashing all parts of the batch to ensure nothing is left intact and everything in kneaded thoroughly . The quality of the joint will be worth the extra time and care . Evaluating Sokui It should not be runny but should be thin enough to spread evenly on the parts to be joined . Too much water will weaken the joint and increase the drying time , too little makes it hard to spread thinly . Different woods and different climates will affect the amount of water needed , making some test pieces and practicing whenever the opportunity ( or rice ) avails will help with the feel of the process . Nori Urushi Nori-urushi is a stronger and more water resistant glue than sokui but has the drawback of being dark coloured and relatively slow curing . The mixture is generally 1:1 with raw natural urushi ( ki-urushi ) lacquer and the water in the sokui allows it to cure quicker than urushi alone , though it should sit for several days before working again . Nori-urushi is used in various stages of lacquering to attach cloth and embedded materials , and is further mixed with 2 parts fine clay ( like diatomaceous earth ) for use as a filler in base layers of hon-shitaji lacquering .

Combining any of these elements would make computers simpler and faster . Magnetic random access memory ( MRAM ) , slated to become commercially available next year , is as fast as random access memory chips , but is also non volatile , meaning it retains information when a computer is turned off . Researchers from the Paul Drude Institute for Solid - State Electronics in Germany have shown that it is also possible to use magnetic random access memory for computation . And because the memory is configurable , computing circuits formed from it could be adjusted on - the -fly to optimize processing for a particular application , said Andreas Ney , a researcher at the Paul Drude Institute . \" The processors can be optimized for each individual computational task . \" Computers that use magnetic logic circuits would be more efficient than those in use today . \" The reprogramability and the non-volatility are expected to increase the computational efficiency for both specialized small , and ... large processors , \" said Ney . Magnetic logic is an idea that dates back to the 1950s . Simple magnetic logic devices were produced for specialized applications in the 1960s , but when silicon chips emerged commercially in the ' 60s they quickly surpassed magnetic logic in performance , compactness and cost-effectiveness . Recent advances in magnetic materials and chipmaking techniques , however , have made it possible to make memory chips that store bits magnetically . Magnetic random access memory is based on magnetoresistance , the same principle used for reading information stored on magnetic hard disks . Some materials conduct electricity more easily when they are in a magnetic field . In materials with high magnetoresistance , there is an easily measurable difference in the flow of electricity through the material when it is surrounded by a magnetic field versus when it is not . These two states can represent the 1s and 0s of computer information . Magnetic random access memory uses magnetoresistive elements made from two magnetic layers . The magnetic orientations , or poles , of the two layers can be parallel or opposite . The combined electrical resistance of the layers is lower than when the orientations are parallel than when they are opposite . The researchers ' found a way for a single magnetic random access memory element to act as any of the four basic logic gates -- AND , OR , NAND or NOR -- that make up computer circuits . Computer processors manipulate information by sending signals through logic gates . In a computer 's binary information scheme , 1 is ordinarily represented by the presence of an electrical signal and 0 is represented by the absence of a signal . Every action performed by a computer processor is a combination of positive and negative signals flowing through basic logic gates . An AND gate measures two input signals , and if both input lines contain signals it returns a signal as output . If either input line lacks a signal the gate returns a 0 . An OR gate returns a 0 if both inputs are 0 and returns a 1 if either or both of the inputs are 1 . NAND and NOR gates return the opposite outputs of AND and OR gates . The researchers ' scheme calls for turning a magnetic memory element into a logic element by attaching three input wires to its top magnetic layer and an output wire to its bottom layer . This makes it possible to represent input using the polarity of an electric current rather than the presence or absence of electric current . The magnetic field that forms around electric current has either a positive or negative polarity . Electric current running through at least two of the three input wires produces a strong enough magnetic field to flip an oppositely polarized top layer . A wired memory element can be used as any of four basic logic gates by setting the two layers to one of the four possible pairs of polarizations before sending input to the device . \" Each of four states directly correspond to one of the four basic logic functions , \" said Ney . \" Programming the logic functions simply means [ selecting ] one of the four initial states . \" The element will perform the AND function if the top layer is negative and the bottom positive and current is sent through two of the three input wires . Sending negative electric current , representing 0 , through both input wires leaves the top layer unchanged . Likewise , if only one of the two inputs is positive , representing 1 , the top layer is unchanged . Only when positive current runs through both inputs does the top layer change to become parallel with the bottom layer , and the device 's output becomes 1 . The element performs the OR function if both layers begin with a positive orientation . The third input wire allows the magnetic logic element to also work as NAND and NOR gates . Current running through all three inputs produces a magnetic field strong enough to change the bottom layer 's orientation , which reverses the device 's output . The output can be sensed , or read , by measuring the magnetic layer 's resistance to current flowing from an input line to the output line . Low resistance shows that the output is positive , high resistance indicates a 0 . Future magnetic logic processors will contain many programmable magnetoresistive elements , probably arranged in a square mesh like today 's random access memory chips , said Ney . Most of today 's processors are hardwired rather than programmable , with circuits that are dedicated to one type of logic operation . Processors are optimized for different tasks -- running a personal computer , or running a car 's brake system -- by arranging these gates in a certain order . Programmable gates mean that all the specific functionality , or programming , needed to instruct a processor to run a given set of operations can be carried out using software programs . This separation between hardware and functionality will allow for universal processors that can be used for many different applications , from controlling a washing machine to controlling a power plant to carrying out rapid computations , said Ney . There 's a lot of work to do before this is possible , however . The remaining work includes optimizing magnetoresistive devices and writing software compilers that efficiently configure the logic gates of a processor to optimize it for a given task , said Ney . The researchers ' next steps are to work out how to configure more complicated logic circuits , and to build prototype devices , said Ney . Once magnetic random access memory is on the market for memory applications , it could in principle be used as a magnetic logic processor by adding an addressing scheme , said Ney . Such magnetic logic processors could be built within two years , said Ney . It will take at least a decade to develop a small , universal , magnetic logic processor , however . \" We think that [ at first ] only embedded processors for very specialized devices are practical , \" he said . Ney 's research colleagues were Carsten Pampuch , Reinhold Koch and K. H. Ploog . The work appeared in the October 2 issue of Nature .

The heads , from various parts of England and Wales , described differences in the appearance of some pupils . One head said : \" My children have grey skin , poor teeth , poor hair ; they are thinner . \" The government said measures were in place to tackle poverty . Lynn , a head teacher from a former industrial town in Cumbria , who did not want to give her full name , was one of a number of head teachers speaking to reporters at the National Education Union conference in Brighton . They were highlighting the issues faced by an increasing number of children growing up in poverty , and how their experiences affect their education . ' Grubby clothes ' Lynn said that hunger was particularly apparent after the weekend . She said : \" Children are filling their pockets with food . In some establishments that would be called stealing . We call it survival . \" Another head teacher from Nottinghamshire , Louise Regan , said : \" When you take children out to an event , maybe a sporting event , you see children of the same age from schools in an affluent area . \" It 's the grey skin , the pallor . It 's the pallor you really notice . \" She went on : \" Monday morning is the worst . \" There are a number of families that we target that we know are going to be coming into school hungry . \" By the time it 's 9.30 am they are tired . \" She said her school supplied some pupils with clean uniforms , and that they often came back in the same clothes , grubby , after the weekend . The school has a food bank which gives out food parcels and a supply of clothes , shoes and coats for those without . Poverty and neglect Lynn said : \" We have washing machines and we are washing the children 's clothes while they do PE . \" We would n't have it that these children are stigmatised because their clothes are dirty . \" The school also runs a summer school for three weeks over the holidays , run voluntarily by teaching staff without pay . Howard Payne , a head at an inner city school in Portsmouth , said there had been a four - fold increase in the number of children with child protection issues . \" Every one of these issues has had something to do with the poverty that they live in , \" he said . \" It 's neglect . It 's because they and their families do n't have enough money to provide food , heating or even bedding . \" Hot meals Mr Payne , who provides debt counselling and family support at his school , said : \" Three weeks ago , many schools in our area closed because of the snow . \" I kept ours open because I was really worried about the children - that they would n't have a hot meal to eat that day . \" He said about 45 % of pupils came into the school to eat that day . All the heads said things were getting worse as social and emotional support services were disappearing . The comments came as the NEU published research it had carried out with the Child Poverty Action Group . It found schools were increasingly stepping in to fill the poverty gap , with almost half of the 900 respondents saying their school offered one or more anti-poverty services such as a food bank , clothes bank or even offering emergency loans to families . ' Proud families ' More than four-fifths said they saw signs of children being hungry during the day , and about the same said they saw children showing signs of poor health . Alison Garnham , chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group , said : \" With nine children in every classroom of 30 falling below the official poverty line , it is time to rebuild the safety net for struggling families . \" Lynn added : \" My families are proud . Some of these parents are working two or three jobs and ca n't access the benefits system . \" They are just a few pounds over - they have less money than those on benefits . \" Jane Jenkins , a head teacher from Cardiff , said children in her school often only brought a slice of bread and margarine for lunch and that teachers supplemented this . \" It 's really difficult and when people are asking you about standards , why we do n't go up the league tables ? \" That 's often a secondary consideration . \" The Department for Education said it wanted to create a country where everyone could go as far as their talents could take them . \" That 's why we launched our social mobility action plan , which sets out measures to close the attainment gap between disadvantaged students and their peers , and targets areas that need the most support through the \u00c2\u00a372 m Opportunity Areas programme . \" A spokesman also highlighted the \u00c2 \u00a3 2.5 bn it invests in disadvantaged pupils through the Pupil Premium and a recent \u00c2 \u00a3 26 m investment in breakfast clubs ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Responding to a question seeking advice from the ulema whether or not it is permissible for a Muslim male to marry two women simultaneously in one sitting , Jamia Nizamia , a 130 - year - old religious institution in the city , answered in the affirmative . The English translation of the fatwa given in Urdu reads as follows : \" Islamic law has allowed a man to keep four wives in his marriage simultaneously on the condition of justice . Now if he gets married to these four wives in different times and in different sittings or gets married with four wives simultaneously in one sitting before two witnesses ( men ) or one man and two women according to Islamic law , it is valid . \" \" In the case in question if one gets married with two wives in one sitting as mentioned , then legally such marriage will be effective . \" The fatwa has been signed by Mufti Muhammad Azeemuddin . Sadr Qazi Muhammad Abdul Wahid Qureshi told this correspondent that he had sought a fatwa from the Jamia Nizamia after his naib ( deputy qazi ) performed the nikah of an Arab national with two girls in the old city on August 1 . \" I was not in the city that day . It was Abdur Raheem who performed that nikah , \" Mr. Qureshi said . His claim was disputed by Kala Pathar police inspector Sadiq Ahmed who said the nikahnamas ( marriage proformas ) have the signatures of Mr. Qureshi . One August 1 , a national of the United Arab Emirates married two girls , both of them said to be below 18 years of age . He gave his name in the nikahnama as Al - Rahman Ismael Mirza Abdu Jabbar and at the hotel in which he stayed as Ahmed Saleh . He was about 45 years old . He disappeared once the news of his two marriages in one night came to light . Police is investigating the case . In another recent fatwa , the Jamia Nizamia has absolved qazis from responsibility for data such as age , previous marriages that is entered on the nikahnama forms in relation to the bride . The fatwa said since the qazi is not allowed to personally collect information from the girl , he should accept details provided by the girl 's father or guardian . Reacting to the fatwa allowing the marriage of more than one girl at a time , expert on Islamic and Muslim affairs Professor Anwar Muazam said that technically such marriages could be correct but they are against the spirit of marriage . If such marriages are allowed someone may even give talaq to more than one woman and marry others in their place . In such a situation the number of marriages and talaqs could be very high . \" Would such a thing make sense , \" he asked . Another scholar , Dr Ziauddin Shakeb , said that permission to marry more than one wife to a Muslim male is conditional to his ability to do justice to his wife or wives and it was in the condition of wars . The word adl or justice is key for polygamy in Islam . \" If one breaks this spirit , then it would look ridiculous , \" he said . Back Top"},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

The contract includes several bonuses , including for winning a division or conference championship , reaching a BCS game and high graduation rates . Fedora , who led Southern Mississippi to an 11 - 2 record and the Conference USA championship , was previously an offensive coordinator at Oklahoma State , Florida and Middle Tennessee before taking over Southern Miss four years ago . He was 33 - 19 in Hattiesburg . North Carolina had been seeking a permanent replacement since firing Butch Davis before the season amid an NCAA investigation into player receiving impermissible benefits and academic fraud . Athletic director Bubba Cunningham said at Friday 's news conference that hiring a permanent coach has been the top priority since he took office in October . Cunningham and chancellor Holden Thorp both called Fedora a \" great fit \" for the Tar Heels . Everett Withers served as interim coach this season . The Tar Heels went 7 - 5 and will play Missouri in the Independence Bowl . Withers will coach North Carolina in the bowl game , and Fedora will coach the Golden Eagles in the Hawaii Bowl on Dec. 24 . Fedora said it was very tough for him to tell his team Thursday that he was taking the North Carolina job . \" We arrived at USM four years ago and they bought in , \" said Fedora , wearing a Carolina blue and navy-striped tie . \" I will always be grateful for that experience , and I will always be a Golden Eagle fan . \" Fedora stressed the importance of academics -- he said he believes every player should earn his degree .

The good reviews did n't translate into chart success , but all that changed with the release of the ' Supernova ' , Hudson 's stellar ( ahem ) collaboration with US rap superstar Kanye West . DS spoke to Mr H about losing The Library and his plan to make it as a popstar with new album Straight No Chaser . How would you describe the new album ? \" My mission statement was to make a pop record , but not a throwaway pop record . My heroes are people like Bowie and Prince and Damon Albarn . I did n't want to do anything niche . Kanye threw down the gauntlet . He said , ' Let 's see if we can make you a popstar ' . I was like ' Let 's have a go !' . It 's a bit more widescreen , a bit more punchy , but the eclecticism of the first record 's still there . There 's a tune where I 'm a cross between Deliverance and Sade . \" Did dropping The Library from your name cause any problems ? \" Not at all . The first record was very much ' Mr Hudson & The Library - A Tale Of Two Cities ' . It was all one big project . A couple of the guys left and this record was more about me working with Kanye . I 've been working in the States on his stuff and on Jay - Z 's stuff , so when I got round to making my record I was n't in that same ' North London , pottering about with my friends ' headspace . But who knows what the next album will be about ? \" Has the success of ' Supernova ' raised expectations for the album ? \" I 'm astonished at how well it 's done . I would have been happy for it to go top ten for just a couple of weeks . If anything it 's a problem because we want to put another single out , but they 're still playing ' Supernova ' on the radio ! It 's a nice problem to have though , so it 's all good . \" How involved has Kanye actually been in the new album ? \" He ' executive produced ' all of it , which means he 's overseen it . He 's got so many projects on the go so his role is kind of supervisory . I 'd always be beavering away and playing him stuff , and he 'd sort of adjust my course , but I was the engine . There 's a queue of people asking him for beats and help , he 's working on his clothing range , and he 's got his own s**t to do as well . My whole approach was not to be demanding of him , but just to try and catch him when he was feeling disposed to help me . \" Have you spoken to him since the Taylor Swift incident at the VMAs ? \" I have spoken to him since the VMAs , but we did n't speak about that . It 's not really on my radar . It 's been the cause of much merriment and I have n't really got anything to add to be honest . \" What do you think about the grand claims that Kanye 's made on your behalf ? \" As you say he does make some grand statements - I believe that he means it , but basically it 's out of my hands . I 'm just going to stay on my grind in the studio and play every show like it 's my last . It 's up to the people at home to decide who I am in the grand scheme of things . I think if I focused on the hype I 'd end up taking my eye of the ball . My approach has always been just to focus on the music . \" What was it like doing ' Young Forever ' on Jay - Z's Blueprint 3 ? \" That was a quick thing . It 's funny because sometimes big tracks come really easily . I 'm not exaggerating , but we did it in an hour . Kanye spent about half an hour on the beats , I spent half an hour on the vocal and then we were like , ' Cool , let 's send it to Jigga ' . And he loved it , so it was almost too easy . If only that could happen every day ! \" Was it intimidating working on an album that 's the follow - up to two such well - received records ? \" Of course , I was s**tting myself ! But when they flew me all the way to Hawaii , it gave me time to realise that they actually wanted me to be there . I 'd be wasting their time if I was too intimidated or too nervous . I wanted to do the situation justice so I was n't going to be shaking like a leaf . But I was terrified of Beyonc\u00c3 \u00a9 though ! \" How do you feel about the tabloid speculation concerning your private life ? \" Do I have a private life ? I 've asked the advice of people with a much higher profile and they 're like , ' Look , you 've just got to ignore it and get on with your thing ' . I think if you start watching the people watching you , that way madness lies . You 've just got to be careful not to pick your nose in public , that 's all ! \" Mr Hudson 's album , Straight No Chaser , is released on October 19."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

He was 73 . Rukeyser died at his home in Greenwich after a long battle with multiple myeloma , a rare bone marrow cancer , said his brother , Bud Rukeyser . As host of \u201c Wall $ treet Week With Louis Rukeyser \u201d on public TV from 1970 until 2002 , Rukeyser took a wry approach to the ups and downs in the marketplace and urged guests to avoid jargon . He brought finance and economics to ordinary viewers and investors , and was rewarded with the largest audience in the history of financial journalism . \u201c He brings to the tube a blend of warmth , wit , irreverence , thrusting intellect and large doses of charm , plus the credibility of a Walter Cronkite , \u201d Money magazine wrote in a cover story . Rukeyser also won numerous awards and honors , including a citation by People magazine as the only sex symbol of the \u201c dismal science \u201d of economics . \u201c Our prime mission is to make previously baffling economic information understandable and interesting to people in general , \u201d he once said in an interview with The Associated Press . Bud Rukeyser called his brother \u201c a giant at what he did . \u201d \u201c He was a pioneer in economic reporting in television . Right up to the time he got ill , he was at the top of the heap , \u201d he said in a telephone interview . Louis Rukeyser quit \u201c Wall $ treet Week \u201d and moved to CNBC in March 2002 rather than go along with executives ' plan to demote him and use younger hosts to update the format . Maryland Public Television , which produced the show , said it was firing him after he used \u201c Wall $ treet Week \u201d to complain about his producers . He contended the station could not fire him because he was never its employee . Less than a month later , he debuted with \u201c Louis Rukeyser 's Wall Street \u201d on financial network CNBC . The new show also aired on some PBS stations . Neither his old show nor his new one lasted long after that . Rukeyser 's last appearance on his CNBC show was Oct. 31 , 2003 , after which he went on medical leave for surgery to relieve persistent pain in his back . In May 2004 , he announced that doctors found a low- grade malignancy during a follow - up exam . Later that year , Rukeyser asked CNBC to end production of his show , which had continued with guest hosts . The PBS successor to Rukeyser 's show struggled , too , and Maryland Public Television pulled the plug in 2005 . \u201c He has been a financial institution , \u201d said Michael Holland , a New York fund manager and sometime Rukeyser guest . \u201c No one can replace him . He brought financial journalism to a new level with his trademarks of honesty , humor and fairness . He always looked at both sides of the issues . His only bias was toward optimism . \u201d Rukeyser was born in New York on Jan. 30 , 1933 . He did not begin his career as a financial journalist , though his father , Merryle Stanley Rukeyser , was a columnist for Hearst Newspapers and International News Service for more than 30 years . He graduated from Princeton 's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs in 1954 , specializing in public aspects of business . He was a political and foreign correspondent for the Baltimore Sun papers , chief political correspondent for the Evening Sun , chief of the Sun's London Bureau and chief Asian correspondent for the Sun . He also worked at ABC News as a senior correspondent and commentator , serving as Paris correspondent and chief of the London bureau . Rukeyser , who published best-selling books and newsletters , rejected the idea that economics is \u201c too dull and - or too complicated to hold an audience larger than the capacity of your average telephone booth . \u201c I think that 's nonsense , \u201d he told the AP . \u201c I think there is a hunger in the American public for clear , believable , understandable , usable pocketbook information . \u201d Rukeyser helped to popularize the often dull and arcane subjects of economics and finance with puns that drew appreciative groans from his audience . Once while answering a viewer 's letter on investing in a hairpiece manufacturer , he said , \u201c If all your money seems to be hair today and gone tomorrow , we 'll try to make it grow by giving you the bald facts on how to get your investments toupee . \u201d After a market slump , he considered changing the name of the show to \u201c Wall Street Wake . \u201d \u201c We have in America a bad tendency that things have to be either serious or fun , \u201d he once told the AP . \u201c Whereas in real life , this is n't true . The teachers we all remember in high school and college were not the ones who put us to sleep . I do n't think any of us should apologize for not being dull . \u201d Rukeyser was survived by his wife , Alexandra , and three daughters . A private funeral service was to be held this week , and his body was to be cremated , Bud Rukeyser said . Family members planned a larger memorial service in New York at a later date ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

The Union Pearson Express shook off its training wheels Saturday as it revved into its first full day open to the public . But while the \u201c Tier 4 \u201d diesel power is the latest in emissions - reducing technology , the joys of riding a train are timeless . I boarded the train just after 10 a.m. , carry - on bag in tow , after walking to the station from the Union Station subway platform . Destination : Toronto Pearson International Airport . It takes about five minutes to hustle from the subway to the gleaming platform , on the skywalk connecting the Via Rail departures area with the Rogers Centre . While waiting for the train , I nosed around the kiosks : coffee and treats at Balzacs , hip souvenirs at a mini Drake General Store and even draft beers at a Mill Street stand . A mini introduction to the tastes and habits of Torontonians . Trains pulled into the station every 15 minutes , as advertised . About 50 people milled about on the platform , most of them suit- and - tie types there for the grand opening , which featured balloons and a cake shaped like the train . At 10:10 a.m. , a few travellers disembarked , and I hopped on . The train cars are so fresh , they have that brand - new car smell \u2014 the scent of luxury . I took a comfy seat , spreading out into a row all my own . The car was only about a quarter full and there was plenty of storage for suitcases . The only real hiccup arrived when I went to buy my round - trip ticket . Passengers can pay their fare on board with a credit card , for a $ 2 surcharge , but the machine had trouble printing my receipt . The journey took the as-advertised 25 minutes , which flew by peacefully . The backyards and trainyards of Toronto are hardly worth writing about , but the free wi-fi was fast . It 's not a long enough trip to warrant much entertainment , anyway . At Pearson , it 's very easy to get from the train to your flight . Either walk to Terminal 1 , or take the free LINK train to terminal 3 . But while the train is ready and willing to shuttle travellers , most of the passengers on board Saturday seemed to be riding the rails just for the novelty . \u201c The girls wanted to go on the train , \u201d said Todd Somerville , family in tow . \u201c We 've been watching the Weston station getting built over the past few years . \u201d The Route Tell us At $ 27.50 each way for an adult fare ( reduced to $ 19 with a Presto card ) , the ride may prove too rich for many Torontonians , especially those living far from one of the four stations . From my Queen West neighbourhood , it would take at least another half - hour to get to Union Station or Bloor . From Scarborough , the time savings become negligible . But for out - of - towners not familiar with the TTC , the train is a good bargain . Grant Matheson and his wife just flew in from Saskatoon , and with the senior discount , their trip cost just $ 23.40 each . Normally , they would take a shuttle to their downtown hotel , for about $ 26 each . \u201c But there was n't one , so they said we had to take the train , \u201d Matheson said . Although a roundtrip cab would n't cost much more than two tickets , Matheson said he prefers a train . \u201c It 's a quick way downtown . \u201d When my colleague David Bateman travelled to Pearson just a few weeks ago , it took 35 minutes to drive from Union to Pearson at around noon , when traffic was light . If you 're catching a cab anytime near rush hour , it 's easy to see how the train could save lots of time , with a smoother ride . My trip back to Union was as uneventful as the way there . Since I 'd bought a return ticket , they simply swiped a barcode on board . As the train pulled backwards into Union Station , I caught a glimpse of the CN Tower . The UP Express had arrived ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Using rarely seen archival documents and remarkable first - person accounts , Peter Balakian presents the chilling history of how the Young Turk government implemented the first modern genocide behind the cover of World War I . And in the telling , he also resurrects an extraordinary lost chapter of American history . During the United States ' ascension in the global arena at the turn of the twentieth century , America 's humanitarian movement for Armenia was an important part of the rising nation 's first epoch of internationalism . Intellectuals , politicians , diplomats , religious leaders , and ordinary citizens came together to try to save the Armenians . The Burning Tigris reconstructs this landmark American cause that was spearheaded by the passionate commitments and commentaries of a remarkable cast of public figures , including Julia Ward Howe , Clara Barton , Theodore Roosevelt , Woodrow Wilson , Ambassador Henry Morgenthau , Charlotte Perkins Gilman , Alice Stone Blackwell , Stephen Crane , and Ezra Pound , as well as courageous missionaries , diplomats , and relief workers who recorded their eyewitness accounts and often risked their lives in the killing fields of Armenia . The crisis of the \" starving Armenians \" was so embedded in American popular culture that , in an age when a loaf of bread cost a nickel , the American people sent more than $ 100 million in aid through the American Committee on Armenian Atrocities and its successor , Near East Relief"},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Ficini De triplici vita About this Item - Title - Three Books on Life . - Other Title - Ficini De triplici vita - Summary - Marsilio Ficino ( 1433 - 99 ) was an Italian Renaissance philosopher , theologian , priest , and physician , best known for his translations and exegeses of the works of Plato . His most important original writings include Theologia Platonica ( Platonic theology , 1469 - 74 ) and Liber de Christiana religione ( Book on the Christian religion , 1474 ) . Presented here is the codex of one of Ficino 's later works , De triplici vita ( Three books on life , 1489 ) , from the Plutei Collection of the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana in Florence . The colophon on the verso of folio 174 indicates that the manuscript was completed on September 16 , 1489 . It thus predates the editio princeps ( first printed edition ) , which was printed in Florence by Antonio Miscomini on December 3 , 1489 . The illuminations are by Attavante Attavanti . De triplici vita consists of three books . De vita sana ( On healthy life ) , dedicated to Ficino 's patron , Lorenzo il Magnifico , is intended to help scholars achieve a healthy life through proper diet and habits . De vita longa ( On long life ) , which Ficino dedicates to Filippo Valori , a notable Florentine and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Lorenzo , provides similar advice to the elderly . De vita coelitus comparanda ( On obtaining life from the heavens ) delves into the possibility of drawing strength on Earth from celestial objects . Ficino dedicated this book to King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary ( 1443 - - 90 ) . Also included in the codex are two philosophical works , Apologia quaedam , in qua de medicina , astrologia , vita mundi , item de magis , qui Christum statim natum salutaverunt inscripta ( Apology for medicine , astrology , the life of the world , and even the Magi who greeted Christ at his birth ) and Epistola , cuius argumentum est : Quod necessaria sit ad vitam securitas , et tranquillitas animi ( Letter on the safety and tranquility of the soul necessary for life ) . The codex is one of the volumes commissioned for the Bibliotheca Corviniana of Matthias Corvinus that remained in Florence after the sudden death of the Hungarian king . The Plutei Collection consists of the approximately 3,000 manuscripts and books from the private holdings of the Medici family , which , bound in red leather with the Medici coat of arms , were arranged on the benches of the Laurenziana when the library first opened to the public in 1571 . Cosimo de' Medici ( 1389 - 1464 ) is known to have owned 63 books in 1417 - 18 , which grew to 150 by the time of his death . His sons Piero ( 1416 - 69 ) and Giovanni ( 1421 - 63 ) vied with each other in commissioning illuminated manuscripts . Lorenzo il Magnifico ( 1449 - 92 ) , son of Piero , acquired a great number of Greek codices and , starting in the 1480s , ordered copies of all texts lacking in the library with the aim of transforming the Medici library into an important center of research . Following the expulsion of the Medici from Florence in 1494 , the books were taken from the family . Giovanni de' Medici , elected Pope Leo X in 1513 , restored the collection to the Medici and another Medici pope , Clement VII ( Giulio de ' Medici ) , organized the establishment of the Laurenziana . - Contributor Names - Ficino , Marsilio , 1433-1499 Author . - Created \/ Published - [ place of publication not identified ] : [ publisher not identified ] , 1489 - 09 - 16 . - Subject Headings - - Italy - - 1433 to 1499 - - Codex - - Illuminations - - Memory of the World - Notes - - Title devised , in English , by Library staff . - - Original resource extent : Vellum ; 160 x 260 millimeters ; 173 folios . - - Reference extracted from World Digital Library : Christopher S.

The game at Sherbeck Field on the campus of Fullerton College required 120 minutes and featured two sendings off before the Fusion won 3 - 1 . The victory avenges the Blues ' 1 - 0 triumph in the 2011 Open Cup and provides Ventura County with a match against Major League Soccer side Chivas USA on May 29 at Ventura College . LA Blues entered the game without the services of newly arrived striker Bright Dike , who is on loan from the Portland Timbers . Dike traveled back to Portland to take part in a friendly against Valencia CF on Wednesday and was thus unavailable for his new team , for whom he has already scored and assisted in two games this season . The scoring opened in the 14th minute when Ventura County 's Tim Pontius put a ball into his own net , ceding the lead to LA . The Premier Development League side responded through Frankie L\u00f3pez , whose penalty in the 35th minute leveled the score at 1 - 1 . Ventura County nearly took the lead in the 50th minute when Kennedy Chongo 's header narrowly missed the target . The Fusion had repeated attempts on goal midway through the second half as L\u00f3pez and Daniel Steres provided the shots . Maykel Galindo came on for LA Blues in the 66th minute . The former Chivas USA and FC Dallas striker almost scored within moments of his entry , and gave the Blues a renewed attacking presence as they tried to win the game in regular time . Perhaps the most important sequence in the second half came when Steres fouled LA midfielder Irving Garcia in the 83rd minute . Fusion goalkeeper Earl Edwards saved Allan Russell 's resulting penalty , keeping the score even at 1 - 1 . Just two minutes later , the Blues had Cory Miller sent off for his second yellow card . Instead of taking the lead and keeping eleven men on the pitch , LA went a man down and remained on level terms . Full - time saw the two sides retreat to their respective benches to regroup for two fifteen- minute overtime periods . In the 97th minute , Fusion manager Ole Mikkelsen was sent off for roaming beyond his appointed technical area . Without its manager and a man up , Ventura County attacked . L\u00f3pez had the best chance of the first overtime , firing just wide late in the period . Just two minutes into the second overtime , the 23 - year old midfielder finally put the Fusion ahead with a 107th minute goal . That strike proved to be the match winner , but not the final action of the highly competitive affair . Edwards survived late LA attempts an equalizer with a double save of Russell and George Davis . The Fusion finally got space enough to enjoy when Travis Bowen scored on a rebounded from a Chongo shot in the 116th minute . The 3 - 1 score line held in favor of eleven- man Ventura County and the Fusion celebrated advancing to the Third Round . Bowen will get chance to oppose his brother Tristan when Chivas USA travel to the northwest next Tuesday . For their part , Chivas crashed out of the Open Cup in the first MLS qualifying round in 2011 ."},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

It also provides the number of inhabitants residing in densely and sparsely populated areas by municipality and county . Urban settlement A cluster of buildings shall be registered as an urban settlement if it is inhabited by at least 200 persons . The distance between the buildings should normally not exceed 50 metres , but for some space - demanding building categories - such as apartment buildings , industrial buildings , offices \/ commercial buildings , schools , hospitals etc . - the distance can be increased to 200 metres . Adjacent built - up and constructed areas , such as parks , sports facilities and industrial areas , should be part of the urban settlement . Building clusters with at least 5 commercial buildings or 5 residential buildings are included up to a distance of 400 metres from the urban settlement core . Urban settlements are geographical areas with dynamic boundaries . Thus the number of urban settlements and their boundaries will change over time , depending on construction activity and changes of resident population . The delimitation of the urban settlements is independent of the administrative boundaries . Classification of urban settlement A standard classification of the urban settlements is : 200 - 1 999 residents 2 000 - 19 999 residents 20 000 - 99 999 residents 100 000 or more residents In the publication Population and land area in urban settlements and from 1rst of January on the situation files , the following classification is used : 200- 499 residents 500-999 residents 1 000 -1 999 residents 2 000 - 19 999 residents 20 000-99 999 residents 100 000 or more residents Rules for change of number and names of urban settlements Where 2 or mor urban setttlements are merged , the new merged urban settlement is always given the number of the largest urban settlement . Where urban settlements of less than 10 000 residents are merged , only the name of the largest settlement is kept . If a merged urban settlement overpass 10 000 residents , the name of the largest urban settlement is kept if the number of residents is more than twice the number of residents in the smallest urban settlement . Otherwise the names will be shared for the new urban settlement . These rules apply from 1rst of January 2013 and onwards . Name : Population and land area in urban settlements Topic : Population Division for Population Statistics Besides statistics of urban settlements the statistics give figures of residents in densely and sparsely populated areas by basic statistical unit and municipality . Yearly None . The code for urban settlement and sparse population is stored on the files over Norwegian residents January 1st each year . Urban settlements are regional delimitations that can describe the urban development in Norway . The dicotomy of sparsely and densely populated areas is useful in analysis describing social , environmental and demographic variations . The term urban settlements is used in Statistics Norway since the Population Census in 1960 . The original definition is , with a few modifications , used in all the censuses since 1960 . Since 1960 to 2001 population statistics for urban settlements has been elaborated in connection with the censuses each 10 years . Since 1990 the statistics are elaborated per 1 January each year . A new method for automatic delimitation of the urban settlements has been used since 1999 . Allthough the definition of urban settlements remains the same , the statistics will differ slightly due to the new method . Figures referring to new and old method should not be compared . In 2013 , Statistics Norway introduced a new method for defining urban settlement boundaries . The urban settlements statistics are still based on information from the Central Population Register and the Ground property register , and it is still the distance between buildings that determines what areas are defined as an urban settlement . But the new method gave a more accurate delimitation , where the outer boundary in most cases will follow the boundary of roads and built - up elements . The more precise delimitation was made possible by using Statistics Norway 's delimitation of land use map . The statistics is mainly used by civil administration ( ministries , directorates , county - and municipality administrations ) as well as for research purposes . Population in urban settlements is used in many analysis as an important variable in social , environmental and demographic studies . No external users have access to the statistics and analyses before they are published and accessible simultaneously for all users on ssb.no at 08 am . Prior to this , a minimum of three months ' advance notice is given inthe Statistics Release Calendar . This is one of Statistics Norway 's key principles for ensuring that all users are treated equally . The international recommendations and definitions are closely related to the Norwegian definition . The most important difference is that the distance between the buildings should not exceed 200 metres in the international definition , whereas the criterion is 50 metres in the Norwegian . In the nordic definition deviation from the 200 metre limit is allowed . Statistics Norway also produce land use statistics for urban settlements . Statistics Act \u00a7 10 None The population is persons registered as residents in Norway . The observation unit is person . The main data sources are the Central Population Register , the national register of Ground , Addresses and Buildings ( Matrikkelen ) and Statistics Norway 's delimitation of land use . The statistic is estimated by counting the number of persons who belong to urban or rural settlement . None If a table consists of three or fewer units and disclosing these units can lead to identification of individuals , the figure is rounded up or left empty . As mentioned there have been some small changes in the definition of urban settlements since 1960 . During the period 1990 to 1998 the statistics have been elaborated on the basis of information from the municipalities own registration in the GAB -register . Since 1999 ( expect of 2001 and 2010 ) the delimitation will be done by Statistics Norway using an automatic method ( GIS ) . Data should not be compared unless the method is the same . In 2013 the method was revised to give a more precise delimitation . The change involves a break in the time series . The area of urban settlements declined , and the number of inhabitants increased , leading to 16 percent higher population density . The sources of error are mainly connected to the quality and completeness in the registers used . By merging the Central Population Register and the GAB register ( Matrikkelen ) , each individual gets coordinates for their reisident . Thus , the key for the merge which is the numeric address , must be identical in the two registers .

In this posture , the wings are mostly spread and drooped to the ground , exposing the bird 's upper back , also called the mantle , which gives the action its name . The head is usually bent down to feed , and the tail is often spread and drooped to provide additional cover and counterbalance . Pronunciation MAN - tuh-leeeng ( rhymes with scantling , \" pant fling \" \" rant ping \" and \" chant bling \" ) About Mantling Many birds of prey , including hawks and falcons , practice mantling after a kill . While they are feeding on the ground , particularly in open fields , rocky ground , or similar areas with less shelter or cover to provide natural concealment , the birds are more exposed . Their instinct is to cover their prey and keep it out of sight so it is not stolen by a larger , more powerful predator , whether that is another raptor or any other type of lurking hunter or scavenger such as a coyote . At the same time , the mantling bird will eat rapidly in order to decrease the time they are vulnerable , storing large bites of meat in their crop for later digestion when they feel more secure and are not at risk of losing the meal . While mantling , the feeding birds may exhibit other nervous behavior . They may frequently look around the surrounding area to scan for intruders , or shuffle their feet to continually readjust the mantling cover to disrupt views from different directions . This also helps them get a firmer grip on their prey for easier feeding or to try and move it if they are assaulted . Birds That Use Mantling Birds of prey put enormous efforts into each hunt , and success rates vary from as high as 85 percent to as low as 10 percent depending on the raptor species , prey abundance , and hunting conditions . Birds frequently seen mantling are often larger species that typically have lower hunt success rates and more reason to guard a successful kill fiercely . Larger raptors such as red-tailed hawks , peregrine falcons , and similar species are also more likely to hunt larger prey and must feed on the ground . These birds therefore use mantling much more often , as it is more difficult to carry their prey to a protected perch . Smaller raptors such as kestrels and shrikes can carry their prey , such as insects , mice , lizards , and similar small animals , and do not need to mantle to protect their meal . In the nest , young hawks may mantle over prey their parents provide . Even if the prey is already dead , this action guards the food from hungry siblings as these young birds become more independent and rely more on their own hunting instincts . In some cases , scavenging raptors will mantle over carrion . Even though they did not kill the prey , their instinct to protect it and keep it away from other scavengers is the same . Birds that regularly feed on carrion , however , such as vultures or caracaras , do not usually display mantling behavior . These scavengers are communal feeders and are more likely to feed in large flocks , with many birds taking advantage of the same food source . If You See Mantling Birds Birders who see a raptor mantling should keep their distance and leave the bird undisturbed to enjoy its meal . Because it can be so difficult for raptors to hunt successfully , they are more skittish and feel more vulnerable while mantling , and if disturbed , may abandon the food . This wastes the effort they 've used , and deprives them of the nourishment they have already captured . Their next hunt may not be as successful , and particularly if they already feel unsettled , they may be less able to replace the lost food . This can be especially critical from late spring to late fall , when raptors may be hunting for their offspring and young birds require more frequent meals for adequate nourishment . Finding a mantling bird gives birders a unique opportunity to properly identify the bird of prey . Not only is the bird likely to remain in one spot as it feeds , therefore allowing birders to observe the bird carefully with a spotting scope or taking numerous photographs , but its posture allows field marks to be easily seen . Look at the colors and markings on the bird 's spread wings and tail as well as its rump and back , but be aware that the mantling posture may distort an observer 's perception of the bird 's overall size or shape . If the prey can be seen at all , it can be another clue to the bird 's identity . Also Known As Covering , Shrouding"},"valid_source":false,"bool_generated":false}

Caemmerer , 1932 EAST WASHINGTON RAILWAY The East Washington was the vestigal remnant of the old Chesapeake Beach Railway which gave up the ghost on April 15 , 1935 . The East Washington survived for another 40 years or so on a slim diet of a liquor company needing deliveries by rail and mostly delivering coal by rail to the local power company from the place locally as known Chesapeake Jct , the interchange with the B&O ; near the intersection of Deane Ave. ( now Nanny Helen Burroughs Ave. ) and Minnesota Ave. , SE . When the nearby power plant converted to oil , that ended the sole reason for the continued existence of the E-W and they abandoned all operations in the latter 1970's . There is an excellent hardback book out on the whole subject of the Chesapeake Beach and the East-Washington Railway by Ames Williams and is currently available NEW for $ 20 or so and is available from the Chesapeake Beach Rwy Museum in Chesapeake Beach , MD . As for the right - of - way ... the Chesapeake Beach line is visible for much of the 28 miles or so in Maryland and the Chesapeake Beach Rwy Museum organizes a hike each year for a portion of the r-o-w , weather permitting around the first weekend in April . Inside the DC line it is more built up and IF you know where to look and and do not mind a less than desirable neighborhood and do NOT get out of your car while exploring , those 3 miles are at least partially findable . Having the book in hand helps though .

ADDITIONAL FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Question : In July of 1881 , President James Garfield was shot at the Washington Railway Depot . Can you tell me where this is in present - day Washington ? Answer : Garfield was shot at the BALTIMORE AND POTOMAC RR Station ( predecessor to the PRR ) , not at the B&O. The Baltimore and Potomac station was located at the southwest corner of 6th and B ( now Constitution Ave ) Streets NW , essentially where the National Gallery of Art , West Building now stands . It was a stub end station , with the tracks going south from it across what is now the Mall , to connect via Maryland Avenue and the Long Bridge to the South , and out through Virginia Avenue Tunnel to the North ( the current day freight only line via Benning and Landover ) . This station was in use until the opening of Washington Union Station ; its removal from the Mall was one of the major objectives of the Senate Park Commission in 1902 . Question : Can you tell me about the train Wreck at Union Station in 1953 ? Yes . RAILROADS THAT SERVED WASHINGTON , D.C.

The reforms are being shelved to push the Children , Schools and Families Bill through parliament before it is dissolved before the general election . One - to - one tuition , a home education register and school report cards are among the abandoned plans for England . Mr Balls expressed his \" deep regret \" , but the Tories defended their position . Under the redrafted Bill , home school agreements , which give head teachers stronger powers to enforce parents ' responsibilities in maintaining good behaviour , have been dropped . Reforms of the primary school curriculum , allowing schools greater flexibility to tailor teaching to their children , have also been shelved , as have catch - up lessons , one - to - one tuition and small group support for pupils needing extra support . Mr Balls has been forced to drop plans for a licence to practise for teachers , as well as well as a requirement that local authorities carry out parental satisfaction surveys on secondary schools . The Bill will no longer give local authorities powers to intervene in schools causing concern and it will not give powers to the secretary of state to intervene in failing youth - offending teams . ' Significant setback ' In a letter to his Conservative shadow Michael Gove , Mr Balls said : \" I do believe the interests of children would have been better served had you agreed to these provisions reaching the statute book . \" Your refusal means the loss of a number of key provisions that would have made a significant difference to the lives of children and their families . \" It is a great pity that you have put at risk improvements in our schools , support for pupils , and the wellbeing of our young people . \" Mr Balls said if Labour won the election he would make sure these measures made it on to the statute book in the first session of the new Parliament . ' Wave of bureaucracy ' But the Conservatives said they had successfully blocked more bureaucracy for teachers . A spokesman said : \" This Bill would have meant a great new wave of bureaucracy swamping schools and it is good news that it has collapsed - teachers will breathe a sigh of relief . \" Mr Gove said the Tories had opposed plans to remove a parent 's right to veto sex education from the age of 15 because \" children are children until they are 16 , and after that they are adults \" . A spokesman stressed that the Tories were in favour of making PSHE statutory , but wanted to support the right of parents of 15 year olds to withdraw their children from these lessons . \" The government refused to allow parents to withdraw children under the age of consent from any sex education they considered inappropriate , \" he said . Mr Gove said the Tories had opposed government plans for one - to - one tuition for children who fall behind because head teachers had been against it , and because it was unnecessarily bureaucratic , tying the hands of teachers . ' Betrayal ' The Terrence Higgins Trust criticised the Tories for their failure to support compulsory sex education for pupils at age 15 . \" It 's a disgraceful betrayal of the next generation , \" said policy director Lisa Power . Sexual health charity Brook said it was \" extremely disappointed that young people could be let down yet again \" over sex education . National director Simon Blake said : \" A broad consensus has now been established between children , young people , parents and professionals in support of statutory sex and relationships education . \" All politicians must listen to this majority . \" The home educators ' group , Education Otherwise , welcomed the shelving of the compulsory register for home-educated children . \" There is a huge sense of relief that this has been rejected , \" said spokeswoman Ann Newstead . \" We are thankful for the support of opposition MPs who took the trouble to listen and engage with home educators . \" We are looking forward to the general election and the opportunity to make our feelings known by the way we vote at the ballot box . \""}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Following a comprehensive review of the rail project , which ought to have commenced passenger operation but had been hindered by unforeseen third party issues and other challenges , the state government said the Marina to Mile 2 section of the project known as the Blue Line Rail , would now be ready for passenger operation by 2022 . The state government had engaged consultants to carry out a technical review and due diligence on the implementation of the project , which substantially had focused on civil works , and reported back to government that operation of the first phase may only commence in 2022 . Alstom SA France , a foreign firm with over 100 years of railway experience covering 60 countries , was subsequently engaged to review the report of the consultants , while the firm in its report agreed that the first phase of the rail project could only become operational in 2022 based on proposed funding pattern . Speaking at the signing of the agreement with Alstom SA , Managing Director of Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority ( LAMATA ) , Abiodun Dabiri , who signed on behalf of the state government , said the partnership was the result of the commitment of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode towards the transformation of public transportation in the state . He said a consortium of experts engaged by the state government to undertake a technical due diligence on the LRMT Blue Line Project ( Mile 2 \u2013 Marina ) had developed a roadmap which was accepted by the state government to bring the railway project to passenger operations . The consortium , according to Mr Dabiri , in a final report , outlined their findings and proposed a roadmap to complete the civil infrastructure works and the Operation & Maintenance ( O&M ) infrastructure that will be needed for the commencement of passenger operation . According to him , \u201c Based on the final report submitted , the consortium of Alstom Transport SA France has been engaged for the procurement , engineering , construction , installation of Operation & Maintenance ( O&M ) moveable infrastructure and commissioning of railway systems towards the commencement of passenger operations for LRMT Blue Line project from Marina to Mile 2 . \u201d While highlighting the extent of works to be carried out by Alstom SA , Mr Dabiri said for ease of implementation , the work plan had been divided into two phases , with phase one aimed at demonstrating the non-public operation of the existing rolling stock before end of second quarter of 2019 . \u201c For this purpose , a track length of about 3.0 km from Iganmu Station to National Theatre will be electrified . This operation would be done with the rolling stocks already supplied for the Blue Line project . \u201c This phase would allow the completion of all the preliminary works that would lead to the financing of the main works in Phase two . Phase one will be fully financed by Lagos State Government through Internally Generated Revenue ( IGR ) . \u201c Phase two , which is expected to be completed in 39 months , would entail the provision and installation of railway operations ' systems for the project from Marina to Mile 2 and the delivery of a passenger - ready Lagos Blue Rail Line by 2022 , \u201d he said . Mr Dabiri further said that the current efforts of Governor Ambode 's administration on the rail project was to bring to fruition the State Government 's commitment to deliver a multi-modal transport system and transform the State 's public transportation landscape with the view to moving it closer to the achievement of the first integrated and multi-modal transport system in Nigeria . The LAMATA boss specifically appealed to businesses and Lagosians to trust the Akinwunmi Ambode 's administration to bring the Blue Rail Line to passenger operation by paying their taxes since the rail project is solely financed by the state government through its IGR . \u201c We had highlighted earlier that what we are doing currently to bring the rail project to passenger operation would be funded through IGR . This is your project ; it is designed to ease the movement of Lagosians , it is designed to improve and increase our competitiveness in the comity of smart cities , it is designed to improve our lifestyle and regenerate our environment . Let us support it , \u201d Mr Dabiri said . Responding , Guy Jean- Pierre , a Director of Alstom SA , thanked the state government for the confidence reposed in the firm and the opportunity given to partner with the state on the Blue Line Rail project . He assured that Alstom would work to ensure the delivery of the Blue Line to passenger operation by bringing on board required expertise and experience in rail system management .

I did n't mean to hurt him . \" It tore at the team last spring , threatening to unravel Jim Lambright 's attempt to push the Huskies back on the national stage . They fought briefly on the field . Then , in the locker room , Kreutz punched Sekou Wiggs in the face , breaking his jaw in two places . Kreutz , who played as a true freshman on the offensive line , was suspended indefinitely from the team . Wiggs , who started on the defensive line , was unable to eat solid foods . Kreutz did n't know if Lambright would let him play again ; Wiggs did n't know if he 'd be able to play again . Kreutz thought constantly about going home . Wiggs thought about suing . The course of Husky football changed because neither did . Reinstated by Lambright , Kreutz was dominating this season . He was the hub of the offense , a Husky center in the mold of Ray Mansfield , Ray Pinney , Blair Bush , Ed Cunningham and Bern Brostek . He bowled people over , running point for Corey Dillon . He was named player of the game in the Apple Cup victory over Washington State . \" Playing between Benji Olson and Bob Sapp made me 10 times better , \" said Kreutz , who dreamed of being all - Pac - 10 as a sophomore , but never thought he would . But then he did n't think he 'd even be at Washington this year . To suggest the fight was as painful for Kreutz as it was for Wiggs is ridiculous . Wiggs lost 65 pounds with his jaw wired , he missed the first three games of the season , and he never regained his starting spot . But Kreutz was wounded . He was instructed by Lambright to take an anger- management course . He was suspended from the team throughout the summer . He was told he would n't play again if he were involved in another incident . When his mother would n't support his return home to Hawaii , he rallied instead around his \" Hawaiian brothers \" on the team : Ink Aleaga , Petro Kesi and Ikaika Malloe . \" They talked me through things , \" he said . \" They stuck with me . \" Kreutz is soft-spoken . He has that gentle demeanor of the carefree Hawaiian . But the volcano inside is dormant , not extinct . He said he 's had no problems this season containing his aggression to the football field . \" They taught me how to leave it there , on the field , \" he said . \" I know I made a mistake . I 'm very sorry for what I did to him . But I 've grown up , I 've matured . I think things are better . \" Kreutz is explosive on the field , playing with an emotion that borders on rage . But more than anything , he is a very good athlete . At St. Louis High School in Honolulu , a perennial power , he was captain his senior year as his team won the state championship with a 13 - 0 record . But he was also state heavyweight wrestling champion as a senior , and threw the shot put . \" He has such good feet and balance , \" Lambright said . \" We saw that from the beginning . \" Kreutz was the only member of his recruiting class at Washington to play as a just - out - of - high - school freshman . Ironically , he came to Washington because the Huskies told him he would n't play . \" Other schools told me I 'd play as a freshman , but the Washington coaches said I 'd probably redshirt , \" Kreutz said . \" That seemed more truthful to me . I was n't sure I was ready to play . \" Kreutz made recruiting visits to Colorado , Nebraska , Arizona , Washington and Hawaii . His parents , Lora , a teacher , and Henry , a stevedore , apparently wanted him on the mainland . Following a well documented and decorated Hawaiian connection - Brostek , Aleaga , Pat Kesi , Siupeli Malamala , Ricky Andrews - he picked Washington and played in all but one game as a freshman , rare at most positions , but almost unheard of on the offensive line at Washington . Kreutz is a warrior . He loves battle . He just has to take care choosing the field and the opposition . Fortunately for his teammates - in lots of ways - he is doing that .

More than 5,000 flights have been canceled and nearly 20,000 delayed since Thursday as a series of weather systems snarled flights from California to the Northeast . However , Frontier customers in Denver appear to have been hit especially hard . Stranded passengers of that airline took to social media in droves , with many showing pictures of long lines of passengers trying to rebook their flights . Others complained of being stuck at the airport for more than a day . Local media reports showed growing piles of luggage , with Frontier apparently unable to keep bags headed in the right direction as its operation bogged down . ABC 7 of Denver described the scene , saying : \u201c A sea of luggage took over the baggage claim area from the canceled flights and passengers stuck on the tarmac for up to five hours . \u201d Even Frontier 's pilots ' union went public about the episode , blasting the carrier 's handling of the situation . Frontier Airlines apologizes for weekend travel woes \u201c While weather conditions made operations for all airlines at Denver International Airport more challenging last weekend , this most recent meltdown by Frontier Airlines is due to the same executive mismanagement and misplaced focus on cost-cutting that has placed Frontier near the very bottom of the industry in operational performance and customer satisfaction , \u201d Capt. Brian Ketchum , head of the Frontier unit of the Air Line Pilots Association ( ALPA ) , said in a statement . \u201c Leaving passengers and even their own cockpit and cabin crews stranded for hours without information is outrageous -- even more so when this quarter was one of the airline 's most profitable ever financially , \u201d Ketchum added . On Monday , Frontier apologized to customers and said it 's doing all it can restore normal operations at Denver , which is its busiest base . \" We want to apologize to customers who have been affected , \" Frontier spokesman Jim Faulkner told Fox 31 of Denver early Monday . \" We 've been working hard to fix the operation . \" \u201c The focus today is continuing to get bags to their owners , \u201d Faulkner added to The Denver Post on Monday morning . \u201c We brought in extra staff to sort through bags , and had a lot of success last night reuniting people with bags . \u201d Faulkner told local media that Frontier 's Denver operation ran into problems as its crews got stuck in other cities that also were experiencing poor weather . And some of the crews that did make it to Denver arrived late , causing them to \u201c time out \u201d as they ran up against work - hour limits for flight crews . \" We had large numbers of [ crews ] who were stranded outside of Denver over the weekend , and many were scheduled to operate flights from Denver to somewhere else , \u201d Faulkner told KUSA Channel 9 of Denver . \u201c In some cases , we had a plane but no crew to fly it because of the weather . \u201d Photo tour : Planespotting at San Francisco International ( SFO ) Ask the Captain : Where does my bag go when I check it ? Frontier 's operations were still struggling on Monday . The airline had canceled about 60 flights nationwide \u2013 nearly 20 % of its entire schedule \u2013 as of 2:30 p.m. ET , according to flight - tracking service FlightAware . A similar number of flights were running behind schedule . More broadly , this weekend 's problems come as Frontier already has struggled with customer - service ratings in recent years . Frontier began to change its business model after it was acquired by Indigo Partners in 2013 , morphing from a traditional low-cost carrier into an \u201c ultra low - cost \u201d one that offers rock- bottom fares but charges extra for nearly everything beyond a spot on the plane . Frontier has struggled with high complaint numbers and low on - time ratings since it moved in that direction . The pilots ' union cited that in calling out the airline for the weekend 's operational problems . \u201c Frontier 's private investors , led by William Franke and Indigo Partners , must decide whether they want to run a reliable airline or loot it , \u201d Ketchum said in the union 's statement . \u201c If it 's the former , they must invest in the infrastructure and front-line employees who are trying to succeed without corporate support . \u201d TWITTER : You can follow Today in the Sky editor Ben Mutzabaugh at twitter.com / TodayIn TheSky IN PICTURES : 30 cool aviation photos Behind the scenes at a flight attendant training center"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Statistics from the National Crime Records Bureau ( NCRB ) indicate that the overall Kejriwal numbers may be closer to the truth , but we need to offer three caveats to this assertion . 1 . The NCRB merely lists suicides in a particular employment category , but that does not mean farming or crop-failure is the cause of the suicide . There is thus an outside chance that both Gujarat and Kejriwal are right , and both are off the mark . It all depends on what was the real cause of the suicide - crop failure or some other reason . 2 . High or low suicide rates are a function of a state 's overall suicide levels . Thus the data to compare is the suicide rate among farmers against the overall suicide rate in a state . Here , Gujarat is not an outlier . Farmer suicides as a percentage of total suicides in the state ranged from 8 - 9 percent . Andhra , Karnataka , Uttar Pradesh , and Maharashtra fared worse . 3 .

But now anyone can serve up a buttered lobster freshly cooked in their own kitchen , safe in the knowledge that it has been humanely killed , thanks to a British entrepreneur . Simon Buckhaven has created a machine that takes less than a second to efficiently and painlessly zap a lobster , crab or other crustacea to death . The price \u2013 at \u00a3 2,500 \u2013 may deter some but many an animal lover or restaurant chef will think it a small price to pay for a cruelty - free death . Plus , according to the manufacturer , the CrustaStun also makes the meat taste better . Inside one of the little machines that are going on sale this week , a lobster takes just 0.3 seconds to die , whereas it can live for three minutes in boiling water . A crab takes even longer to die as it is boiled to death \u2013 up to four and a half minutes . After several trials here and in the US , Mr Buckhaven 's firm , Studham Technologies , in Bedfordshire , has developed a machine that takes five seconds to use , and meets health and safety and other regulations on both sides of the Atlantic . The entrepreneur is firmly in the \" yes \" camp in the old argument about whether lobsters feel pain . One side is that their nervous systems are not complex enough to experience what humans would recognise as pain , implying that , for a lobster , being placed in boiling water would be like being sent gently to sleep in a warm whirlpool bath . This conclusion was buttressed by research published in Norway in 2005 , but in November 2007 , Professor Robert Elwood , of Queen 's University , Belfast , published the results of an experiment which involved daubing acid on the antennae of prawns . The animals immediately reacted by touching the affected areas , a reaction consistent with experiencing pain , although other specialists in the same field argued that the prawns may simply have been cleaning their antennae , without suffering distress . Mr Buckhaven is in no doubt that research like Professor Elwood 's is conclusive , and means that the practice of subjecting crustaceans to a slow death will have to end . \" These are sentient animals , who feel pain and distress , and you should not boil them alive , or drown them in fresh water , or cut them in half while they 're alive , \" he said . \" A lot of people who love to eat lobster do not like preparing it at home because they have to cook it in boiling water . And restaurants are more frequently hearing questions from customers about how their lobster will be killed . \" He added that in one blind test , customers were given lobsters killed in boiling water and lobster that had died in a CrustaStun , and every participant said that they preferred the meat from the electrocuted animals . \" It was sweeter meat and better consistency , \" he said . \" If you eat an animal which had been under stress before it died , it affects the meat quality . \" However , a planned demonstration of the CrustaStun turned into an unmitigated disaster \u2013 not least for 1,800 lobsters . It was a charity event for 600 guests in Tucson , Arizona , whose organisers had consulted the animal welfare group Peta , to see if there would be any objection to having lobster on the menu . Peta said it would be acceptable , if the lobsters were killed in the CrustaStun machines rather than being boiled or drowned in fresh water . Peta bought two of the machines and paid for Mr Buckhaven to travel out to demonstrate them . The machines were shipped out separately . Sadly , the delivery company let them down , 1,800 lobsters died horribly , and the machines turned up in Tucson two days late . \" We were completely let down , and are suing to get the money back , \" Mr Buckhaven said . Despite that catastrophe , he is convinced that there will be a growing demand for his machines . His company is now offering two types of lobster zappers . The larger industrial models , which cost over \u00a3 60,000 each , are already in use in the UK , Ireland , Norway and Portugal . Some supermarkets are now stocking lobster only if it has been killed by electrocution .

Turner had summoned Whitman , a starting tight end for the Illini from 1997 - 2000 , to discuss some of the worst news the player would encounter during his career . \" You could tell he was nervous when I called him in , '' Turner recalled Wednesday over the phone . \" I said , ' Josh , you 're in trouble . \u2026 You got a B . ''' The memory made Turner chuckle . \" I'll never forget his reaction : He put his head down and said , ' I know , coach , ''' Turner said . \" He felt like he let me down . '' To Turner , that summed up the kind of person Illinois hired to be its next athletic director , a conscientious 37 - year - old governed by a deep sense of personal responsibility and guided by a work ethic exceeded only by his intelligence . Turner knows Whitman as well as anybody ; he recruited the class valedictorian out of Harrison High School in West Lafayette , Ind . He watched Whitman develop into an Academic All - American and serviceable Big Ten tight end good enough to spend time in the NFL with four teams . He nurtured a relationship strong enough that the former player and coach tailgated together at last month 's Rose Bowl . He saw this coming \u2014 more than a decade ago . \" I 'm not surprised at all , '' said Turner , now the Florida International coach who talked to Whitman throughout the process . \" Once Josh got into this field , I remember saying he will be the athletic director at Illinois at some point . He 's very mature . He 's ready . He has a pride and passion for Illinois that the place needs right now . '' Whitman 's lack of experience raised immediate questions about an administrator jumping from Division III Washington in St. Louis \u2014 where the athletic budget was $ 7 million , according to the Equity in Athletics Disclosure data \u2014 to a Big Ten institution such as Illinois , which spent $ 74.4 million in the last fiscal year . Those concerns are valid but , on the other hand , consider Illinois finally showed self - awareness often in short supply to make the best of a bad situation . Perhaps hiring a bright up - and - comer such as Whitman suggests the university understands what it is \u2014 and what it is n't \u2014 as its upcoming period of renewal begins . Perhaps the \" pride and passion \" Turner promised Whitman has for Illinois will carry him and appease alums until the quick learner gets a better sense of just how big the job is . The choice of Whitman is unorthodox but not necessarily unwise for an underachieving program that should aspire to compete for national championships . Remember , the school started its pursuit at the top , being rebuffed by Northwestern AD Jim Phillips , an Illinois alum . Other qualified candidates considered good fits stayed away from what one veteran AD called \" a dumpster fire . '' The search clumsily continued down an obscure trail with the committee whittling down a list of names that were , in the words of another AD , underwhelming . In that context , Illinois easily can justify putting its athletic future in the hands of a renaissance man like Whitman \u2014 an attorney educated at its own law school who practiced in Washington , D.C. , before diving into athletic administration at Wisconsin - La Crosse . There Whitman emerged from a pool of 70 candidates to get the job at 32 despite only having worked in a college athletic department as an assistant to former Illinois AD Ron Guenther from 2005 - 2008 . \" He had a great presence , '' Wisconsin - La Crosse Chancellor Joe Gow told the Tribune on the phone . \" Frankly we took a little bit of a chance but we picked up immediately on what incredible integrity Josh has . '' A Whitman sampler of the AD 's strength and sincerity : Gow noted the diplomacy Whitman demonstrated in handling two tricky coaching transitions , one involving the football coach he fired five months into the job . Gow and Whitman became confidants , sitting together at athletic events and sharing ambitions . It was no secret to Gow where Whitman wanted to work one day . \" He always has had a soft spot for Illinois but even that might have been too much to dream of at the time , '' Gow said . \" I knew this day would come \u2014 admittedly it 's sooner than I thought . But I can assure you he 'll deliver on his promises . '' Whitman should avoid promising anything but his best effort at Thursday 's introductory news conference . Whitman 's top priorities seem obvious : 1 ) Decide what to do about basketball coach John Groce , who 's likely to stay given three years remain on his contract ; 2 ) Determine the long - term direction of the football program , which figures to move on from coach Bill Cubit after next season ; 3 ) Develop a facility upgrade plan to close the gap in the Big Ten ; and 4 ) Restore the luster to a severely tarnished athletic program . History says that whatever Whitman does will affect those around him profoundly . On Norv Turner 's last day as Chargers coach after the 2012 season , according to the San Diego Union - Tribune , he referenced Whitman in his farewell speech . Whitman played in four games for the Chargers in 2001 yet touched Turner , Ron 's brother , with the note he wrote the coach days before his final game . \" On the bottom of it , he said , ' You changed my life , ''' Turner told Chargers players .

But Assembly Speaker Robin Vos suggested suspending the one - week waiting period for benefits might discourage people from getting back into the workforce . \" I think the problem is not the suspension of a one - week waiting period . It 's getting more people into the workforce to fill the huge number of jobs that are going unresponsive to employers who need folks , \" the Rochester Republican told reporters . Vos stressed that he had not talked to other Republicans who control the Legislature and said no final decisions have been made . Republicans a decade ago instituted the one - week waiting period to help shore up the state 's unemployment fund . They agreed to temporarily end it last year because the federal government began paying for benefits during the first week of unemployment during the coronavirus pandemic . The state 's one - week waiting period recently went back into effect because the federal aid for benefits was coming to an end . But the new stimulus law , known as the American Rescue Plan , will continue to have the federal government pay for the first week of benefits because the pandemic is ongoing . If the Wisconsin Legislature again suspends the waiting period , those who lose their jobs could receive hundreds of dollars during their first week of unemployment at no cost to the state or its employers . But Vos said suspending the one - week waiting period could have the \" unintended consequence \" of keeping people on the sidelines when businesses are looking for workers . Suspending the one - week waiting period would require the support of the Assembly and Senate , both of which are controlled by Republicans . Democratic Gov. Tony Evers backs the idea and has called for permanently ending the waiting period . Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu , a Republican from Oostburg , declined to say what he thought of suspending the waiting period as he stepped off the Senate floor after a session Tuesday . Democratic Rep. Daniel Riemer of Milwaukee said it was a bad idea to give up millions of dollars in federal aid that could help people as soon as they lose their jobs . \" The fact that you lose a job does n't mean you lose the requirement to pay rent , the requirement to pay your mortgage , the requirement to pay for day care , which is so expensive , or for groceries , \" he said . Wisconsin 's unemployment system has caused some of the state 's biggest problems throughout the pandemic . The state Department of Workforce Development was crushed by the high volume of claims at the beginning of the outbreak as unemployed Wisconsinites applied for benefits . The department tried to quickly hire employees but struggled to implement new federal benefit programs with its outdated computer system . Thousands of unemployed people waited months for their payments , with some struggling to feed families , pay rent and keep the lights on . At one point , more than 100,000 claims were caught in the backlog . The department was able to catch up on the claims in December , but some applicants are still waiting for an adjudicator or judge to determine whether they qualify for benefits . Nearly 16,000 people are still waiting on an appeal , according to department data . The most recent data from the department show more than 12,000 people filed for unemployment for the first time during the week of March 6 . Nearly 100,000 people filed a regular weekly claim . Those figures do not include claims filed under recent federal programs , such as the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program and the Pandemic Unemployment Emergency Assistance program .

While the days of the heavy - handed ' War on Drugs ' are ( mostly ) behind us , we are all still faced with navigating a society that stigmatises and punishes weed users in many ways . This is without mentioning that we live in a federation . Each state has its own set of laws , requiring their own unique strategies . This series will address the key legislation and policies you 'll need to be aware of as a resident stoner in Australia . We 'll be focusing on recreational use and growing for personal use \u2014 if you 're a dealer and you get busted , that 's on you . Last time , we covered the essential bud - law you need to know for getting stoned in WA . This week : South Australia . Minor Possession and Expiation There 's a common misconception when it comes to cannabis law in SA , so let me clarify : weed is still very much illegal . To possess , smoke , or distribute it constitutes an offence under the Controlled Substances Act 1984 . That said , the expiation system in place there makes it far less of a risk to possess small amounts than in other states . Under the Expiation of Offences Act 1996 , simple cannabis offences can be expiated by a police officer . An expiation is a small fine , given in lieu of prosecution , to be paid within 28 days . They can be given for possession for the following : - Cultivating one cannabis plant without artificial enhancement ( non-hydro , no artificial lighting , no commercial fertilizers ) - Possession of up to 100 grams of cannabis - Possession of up to 20 grams of cannabis resin - Smoking cannabis ( except in a public place ) - Possession of smoking implements Expiation notices are subject to the following conditions : - The recipient must be aged 18 or over - They may relate to up to three offences arising from the same incident - They wo n't be given for charges of possession / cultivation for commercial purpose or supply , even if the total amount is less than the ' simple cannabis offence ' threshold - If given an expiation notice you may choose to opt for prosecution instead ( Dunno why you would ever do this , but maybe $ 300 is worth more to you than a criminal record ) Expiation fines are currently as follows based on the Controlled Substances ( Controlled Drugs , Precursors and Plants ) Regulations 2014 . Fine amounts : Possession : - Less than 25 grams of cannabis : $ 150 - Between 25 and 100 grams of cannabis : $ 300 - Less than 5 grams of resin : $ 150 - Between 5 and 20 grams of resin : $ 300 - Equipment for preparing or consuming cannabis or resin : $ 150 ( + $ 30 when accompanied by another simple cannabis offence ) Cultivation : - One cannabis plant : $ 300 Smoking / consumption - Smoking or consuming cannabis or resin ( except in a public place ) : $ 150 Expiation notices must be given if found committing those offences in SA , so you are relatively safe from prosecution so long as you keep your quantities low and do n't smoke in public places . And pay your expiation fines on time ! Taking more than 28 days will incur a late notice and another fine , any longer than that and you 're risking prosecution . Cultivation Once you move beyond one plant , or you start using ' artificial enhancement ' in your growing , you become subject to much harsher penalties in SA courts . Artificial enhancement is defined in the Controlled Substances Act ( 1984 ) as : - cultivation in a solution comprised wholly or principally of water enriched with nutrients ; or - cultivation involving the application of an artificial source of light or heat ; Quantities and maximum penalties for cultivation offences are as follows : - 1 plant ( no artificial enhancement ) : expiation notice & fine of $ 300 - 2 to 4 plants : $ 1000 fine and / or 6 months imprisonment - 6 to 9 plants : $ 2000 fine and / or 2 years imprisonment - trafficable quantity ( 10 to 19 plants ) : $ 75,000 fine and / or 15 years imprisonment - commercial quantity ( 20 to 99 plants ) : $ 500,000 and / or life imprisonment - large commercial quantity ( 100 + plants ) : $ 500,000 and / or life imprisonment These maximums are rarely if ever reached . Actual penalties tend to be significantly lower , except in cases involving organised crime or seriously negligent legal advice . Further Charges - Supply and low-level cultivation offences ( growing hydro ) will be prosecuted in SA , and each carry a maximum $ 2000 fine and / or 2 years imprisonment . - Charges for trafficking or cultivating cannabis are tried summarily ( by a judge without a jury ) in the Magistrates Court . If the sentence is likely to exceed 5 years , cases will be transferred to the District Court . You 'll be indicted and tried before a jury . The maximum penalty for an offence in this case is up to $ 50,000 and 10 years imprisonment \u2014 $ 75,000 and 15 years for an aggravated offence . - Trafficking , sale , or cultivation or a commercial or ' large commercial ' quantity can carry sentences of up to $ 200,000 and 25 years imprisonment . Charges in this range are generally applied for entire grow houses , so recreational stoners have nothing to worry about here . - If an expiation notice is not paid , simple cannabis offence charges typically carry a $ 500 - $ 1000 maximum fine . The criminal record that comes with prosecution will likely be much worse than the damage to your bank account . Case Studies Due to the non-prosecutorial nature of South Australian cannabis legislation , small offences are hard to study . I 've included two examples of larger offences listed in the courts \u2014 useful examples of the sorts of sentences that are handed down for larger - scale possession and trafficking charges . R V SIMON MATTHEW BUCKINGHAM ( 2019 ) 41 - year - old man charged for trafficking a commercial quantity of cannabis . Found with 2.3 kgs of packaged cannabis , two hydroponic plants , and equipment for sale . Defendant had a distant history of prior drug possession offences . Sentenced to four years imprisonment with a non- parole period of two years . R V VASILIOS MANIATIS ( 2019 ) 45 - year - old man with no prior convictions , convicted for trafficking a large commercial quantity of cannabis , as well as cultivating a commercial quantity and possessing associated equipment . Found with 4.6 kg dried cannabis , plus 33 plants at various stages of development . Sentenced to five years imprisonment , reduced to three years for an early guilty plea including 18 months without parole . Next Week \u2026 If you 're on your way out of Adelaide and into Melbourne , then you 're in luck \u2013 so are we . The Cannabis Law Cheat Sheet will be back next week with everything you need to know about buds and Victorian state law . Til then !"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

As I tried to replace the lid I trapped my little finger in the jar where I can only assume the specimen mistook my finger for a cricket . I am a 39 year old male of average build and reasonable health . I have no allergies , that I know of , but have had an allergic reaction to a previous spider bite ( Steatoda grossa ) . I had drunk around three pints of Guinness earlier that evening . I have been diagnosed as Asthmatic , but have only ever had to use my inhaler 5 - 6 times in the 12 + years since my asthma was first diagnosed . 10th September 1:55 am . Tingling sensation in finger , feels hot ( due to the squeezing ? ) , tip swollen , numb and with slight reddening , only a shade or two darker than the finger next to it , not noticeably different . The spider was captured and returned to her container and books containing information on spider bites were gathered , ( there would be a good chance I would have more information than the people attending to me at the Hospital , as spider bites are a rare occurrence ) . I then woke Lesley up to tell her the good news . 2:35 am . We set off to Hospital , just in case . 2:50 am . Slight pain in left elbow , finger almost stiff - feels as if I have wrenched my finger back and has the same painful pins and needles feeling one gets when the hands have been in the cold too long . 3:00 am . Arrive at hospital . Slight pain under arm and triceps . Under Hospital recommendation I take two aspirin , these were taken at 3:30 am . While at hospital the nurse and I looked in Toxbase where no mention of any spider bites was to be found . We then rang Guys Hospital where another nurse found some reference to spider bites , but not Poecilotheria . All we had as a guide was the comments in Schultz & Schultz and Verdez , where one person bitten by P. regalis had a sore finger and the other was in hospital for five weeks - nothing really sound for the nursing staff to work from . Since I had been bitten almost two hours ago and was still standing , the nursing staff decided to administer two aspirin to relieve the pain ( uncomfortable , but not agonising ) . 3:45 am . Left hospital . At this point in time there was no visible tracking from the bite ; no sense of euphoria , nausea ; no hallucinations ; no bowel movements and no sign of any necropsy around the bite ( I remained calm at all times ) . When I returned home I had a cup of coffee . No dressing or cream / ointment was ever put on the wound . 4:30 am . Went to bed . The sub-adult , female P. pederseni was feeding and showed no signs of stress . 4:00 pm . Finger and knuckle was still stiff and had that wrenched , pins and needles feeling . I did some gardening and found it painful to grip with my left hand , but this did not prevent me using my hand . 11:30 pm . I had a warm bath and took my watch off ( I always keep my watch on , except for swimming and bathing . I like to wear my watch tight on my wrist ) . 12:55 am . The knuckle of my wedding finger was stiff ( exercise from gardening or venom ? ) . I then went to bed . 11th September , 8:30 am . The finger was still stiff as I set off to work . 11:00 am . Felt flu like . My breathing was a bit heavy and my left armpit glands were swollen and painful . 2:00 pm . Requested to be taken back to hospital as my breathing was now much heavier . 2:20 pm . Back in hospital we tried to get in touch with Jean Lou Dorne at Southampton University ( the other people who I would have sought help from were in India ) . 4:30 pm . Discovered Jean Lou was on holiday , the person I spoke to suggested I might be having an allergic reaction to the venom . I explained this to Andy , the nurse attending me , he agreed with this and prescribed Cetirizine ( 10mg tablets ) , and Prednisolone ( 5mg tablets ) a steroid and an anti-histamine respectively . I had to take 10mg of each tablet each day , for five days . 12th September , 10:30 am . Woke up to find that my finger was still stiff . Most of the pain had gone , but I felt very rough and still flu like . I walked up to the Post Office to pick up a parcel ( the walk was around 600 m , but up-hill ) . When I got to the Post Office I could only pick up one package and had to go home for proof of identity for the other one . As I returned to the Post Office I had a mild asthma attack and had to sit down for 20 minutes , and use my inhaler , before I could pick up the parcel . I was given a lift home where , after a drink of water and my pills , I sat down and fell asleep . 4:30 pm . Woke up , still feeling pretty groggy . For the next day I refrained from any strenuous activity . I felt worn out and my stool was of a softer consistency than normal . This could have been due to the steroids and anti-histamines ( there was also no sign of blood or mucus ) . My urine was normal too - no blood or marked discoloration . My breathing was still noticeable , but not as heavy as before . I did not feel like eating and went off even mildly spicy food . I regularly used my inhaler , both the blue and the brown ones . 15th September . Woke up early with pain in my lower sides - could be due either to a mixture of German beer and Tequila , or more allergic reactions to the venom . ~ 1:30 pm . I felt as if I had really bad heartburn . I then had a drink and took the last of my pills . ~ 1:45 pm . Felt slightly better . 5:30 pm . The little finger on my left hand was flicking under the wedding finger at the knuckle . I found this painful , but bearable and had to push the knuckle back out again . In the following minutes this happened three more times , only staying out in its normal position on the third push out . I then massaged my finger . 17th September 9:05 am . Woke up with severe cramp in my lower , left leg and to a lesser degree , in my right foot behind the toes . 10:45 am . Attended a Doctors appointment . The cramp in my left leg was still there . A urine sample was also given . By now I was starting to feel less flu like . As I had no steroids or anti-histamine to take I asked the Doctor for a re-prescription , which was declined . Every time I stretched or yawned , I could feel some of my muscles tighten up almost cramp like . 18th September . Back to work . My finger was still a little stiff and I felt better , but my leg muscles were still not fully relaxed causing me to walk with a slight limp ( right foot still hurt too ) . 19th September , ~ 6:00 pm . I managed to speak to Jean Lou , who agreed that I had had an allergic reaction to the spiders venom . It was suggested that I take Ibuprofen , as an anti inflammatory . He also informed me that the allergic reaction could last a couple of weeks . I started taking the Ibuprofen that night and continued for the next couple of days . By the evening of the 21st I was no longer walking with a limp as my calf muscle was now back to normal . Although I still had the pain in my right foot , I could feel it was residing . Conclusions Very little is known about the effects of theraphosid venom , and the Medical facilities have little or no knowledge on the subject . With this in mind I would request that any useful information should be supplied to me , so that I can pass it onto my local health authority who will ensure that the relevant information is made available for future reference . I would also request that a copy of this journal and any other BTS journals containing bite information be sent to myself , so that I can also supply this information to my local health authority . If you do get bitten , stay calm , get someone to take you to hospital immediately . If you use an inhaler take it with you , bring some other information such as the books referenced below , especially Verdez and Schultz . Make accurate notes , with times if possible - you might be the first person to be bitten by that species , so all the information you gather will be invaluable for medical knowledge , and for treating the bite . I would like to thank the following people for their advice , interest , time and concern : Jean Lou Dorne , Jan - Ove Rein , S\u00f8ren Rafn , Henrik Wessel Frank , Ray Hale , Steve Copley , the attendant Nursing Staff at Princess Margarets Hospital Swindon , and last but not least Lesley for her taxi driving , humour ( at my expense ) and all round care and concern .

All eight ferry employees - including a husband - and - wife team in Chester - Hadlyme - received notices Thursday that their positions will be eliminated as of Aug. 25 , Chester - Hadlyme ferry employees said Thursday . But do n't expect the ferries to run until then ; they 'll be shut down a few days before that in order to get the boats off the water and store them , likely for good , said John Marshall , master captain of the Chester - Hadlyme ferry . \" If you 're going to take it out of service , it needs to go somewhere . It ca n't just sit , \" Marshall said . Department of Transportation spokesman Kevin Nursick would not confirm news of the layoffs and referred all questions to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy 's office . The layoffs are part of Malloy 's plan to reduce the state work force by about 13 percent to fill a $ 1.6 billion hole in the state budget . The state today will unveil what the 6,560 job eliminations - including 884 in the DOT alone - will mean to state services . The DOT 's maritime manager , Chuck Beck , handed to the Chester - Hadlyme ferry 's five full - time employees letters detailing the job cuts during a meeting at noon Thursday , said Tom Darcy , one of three ferry captains who has a combined 22 years on both state ferries . Rocky Hill - Glastonbury 's three ferry employees received elimination notices earlier in the day , said Darcy 's wife Diane Darcy , a first mate in Chester - Hadlyme with 17 years on the job . The Darcys had been worried about losing their jobs since last year , when they first got word that the ferries were on a list of possible budget cuts . Diane Darcy 's first thoughts upon receiving the layoff notice Thursday were : How would they pay for their daughter 's last year of college ? Would they be able to afford their mortgage and keep their house on Ferry Road in Hadlyme ? But ultimately , she said , the disappointment Thursday was n't about the job losses . \" The saddest part of it is , they 're going to close this thing , and it 's never going to come back , \" she said . \" It 's not going to be there for our kids , it 's not going to be there for their kids , as it has been for 242 years . \" An illustrious past When Jonathan Warner started running the Chester - Hadlyme ferry in 1769 , it was pushed across the river with long poles . The ferry was given its current name in 1882 when the town of Chester took over its operation , according to the state , which began running it in 1917 . The Rocky Hill - Glastonbury ferry has been around even longer - since 1655 - and is the country 's \" oldest continuously operating ferry service , \" according to the state . The Chester - Hadlyme ferry , which runs April 1 through Nov. 30 , is the busier of the two , with 18,890 river crossings in the 2009 - 10 fiscal year . It cost the state $ 338,706 to run the ferry that year , but the ferry generated $ 106,302 in revenue that year , according to the DOT . The ferry is an established part of the lower Connecticut River area , for both practical and sentimental reasons . Ambulances use the ferry to shuttle patients on the east side of the river to Shoreline Medical Center in Essex , and it 's popular with locals who ride the ferry to commute to work , preferring it over both the Interstate 95 Baldwin Bridge and the swing bridge in East Haddam . Visitors drawn to landmarks such as Gillette Castle and Goodspeed Opera House take it to get from one tourist attraction to the other . \" This thing brings in a lot of money , \" Marshall said . \" It 's hard to quantify that , but I can tell you this . On the afternoons and mornings and weekends , and at all times , I 'm sending people to Middletown , I 'm sending them to Chester , I 'm sending them to Deep River , Essex , Old Saybrook - all throughout the Connecticut River Valley . ... We 're giving them directions to the casinos , to New London , to Salem Four Corners . \" Around Halloween , ferry employees decorate the gates at the ferry landings with masks of ghosts and goblins . Every November , they string Christmas lights on the ferry , send out a holiday greeting card and have an end - of - the - season party on the boat . A ' bitter disappointment ' Lyme First Selectman Ralph Eno said Thursday he was n't surprised to hear that ferry employees were part of the thousands receiving pink slips from the state . \" They 've got to let a lot of people go if the budget is going to balance , \" Eno said . But the imminent loss of the Chester - Hadlyme ferry is \" a very bitter disappointment \" to residents , especially given how the layoffs came about , he said . \" It 's a big piece of history , \" Eno said . \" You hate to see that kind of thing go because of a lack of foresight on the part of the people who were voting on the concessions . \" Residents and passengers last fall learned that the ferries - frequent targets of budget cuts - were again on a list of possible cuts . Many rallied to save the Chester - Hadlyme ferry , in particular , with a 2,000 - signature petition and meetings with state employees and legislators . The Hadlyme Public Hall Association organized a \" Save the Ferry \" effort , dedicating $ 1,000 of its own funds to the effort . Ferry supporters rejoiced when it appeared the ferries would continue to be funded under the new state budget . But the relief was short - lived , and word quickly spread that the ferries ' future was once again uncertain after the Malloy administration failed to negotiate concessions with unions that would have prevented mass layoffs . The Hadlyme association held a meeting June 28 to re-energize public support for the ferries and plans to hold another meeting at 7 p.m . Sunday at the public hall to \" review the situation , \" association President Curt Michael said .

In doing so , he questions the validity of our modern views of landscape and nature . This article is adapted from Gerard Reichel - Dolmatoff 's opening address to the First International Congress of Ethnobiology , which took place in Belem Do Para , Brazil , in July 1988 . It was published in The Ecologist Volume 29 Number 4 , July 1999 . Coming from Colombia , I can say that I come from the head - waters of the Amazon . When I leave the country , I fly over its many arms and branches stretching out from this great body of water . In saying this I have used the vocabulary of anatomy . In speaking of the river I have mentioned its head , its body , and its arms . Many languages use anatomical terms when describing landscape features , but most people , when being reminded of this fact , would find themselves at a loss when asked to explain the reasons for this choice of words . To people belonging to a scientific , technological , rationalistic age , it does not make much sense to use such animistic terminology , to speak of a river mouth , of the body of a lake , or the foothills of a mountain . If we come to think of it , there is something archaic , something romantic about this kind of language . Every part of the Indians ' dress is imbued with significance . \" Herbert Grade / Still pictures . But the Indians can tell us what is meant by all this , and we should heed the Indian words because they convey to us the true meaning of these terms , a meaning we have lost in the course of our frantic advance towards what we call progress . To most Colombian Indians , and especially to those of the north - west Amazon , the river is a human body , a living organism . The river is life itself , stretched out in a linear sequence of vital events , between two power spots : the headwaters and the river mouth . There has always been something strangely enticing about headwaters the world over . They are thought to be the sources of great energies , the sources of wisdom , the spots where essential transformations may occur under the guardianship of benevolent nature spirits . According to the Indians , people who live at the headwaters of a river are more tradition - oriented ; they have more esoteric knowledge than others . Besides , there is more wildlife at the headwaters and so they are good hunting grounds . But hunting , of course , is not devoid of danger because all game animals stand under the protection of powerful spirits that might cause harm to the hunter who kills too many of their species . So the headwaters are very sacred ; they are a very special part of a river drainage . The other extreme of the river 's lifeline is its mouth . The true power of a river is said to reside at its mouth . It is thought that both the headwaters and the mouth of a river are enclosed by invisible boundaries forming a hexagonal space , modelled on a rock crystal . The hexagon of a river mouth is larger and more powerful than that of the headwaters . When leaving the hexagonal space of the river mouth , shamans say that one has become a transformed person , that one is better and wiser , that from now on one will avoid noisy places and bad company . The Indians say that the river is life : this idea is expressed in many images . In the first place , in many Creation Myths , embryo - genesis is said to have taken place in a lake , in a riverbed , in a deep pool of the river . The slow evolution of embryonic and foetal development took place in a strictly sequential line of womb-like pools in which the incipient being acquired the faculties that made it human . In another image , the river is a model of ethnogenesis , of cultural origins . The Tukano Indians call themselves Anaconda people and believe that mankind was born at the river mouth and then travelled upstream in a huge canoe shaped like an anaconda . At certain spots , people went ashore and , one by one , acquired the fundamental institutions of their society and culture . There is a spot where they danced for the first time ; another spot where they learned the first songs ; a spot where they cleared the first fields ; a spot where they built the first maloca ; another spot where they had their first hallucinatory experience ; a spot where the rules of exogamy were established . In this manner the entire river landscape comes alive , because every spot along the river has its name , its place in myths and visions , its place in genealogies and its particular significance to the passer - by . Every bend in the river is a reminder of the great serpent 's coils and , at the same time , the anaconda of mankind 's and nature 's origin is a projection of the Milky Way . In another image , the river is a model for individual adult life , a metaphor which is explained in the following terms : a river always adapts its course to the relief of the landscape by flowing along its deepest parts : by sheer gravity it hollows out its bed , by moulding itself around mountains and hills , and across plains and swamps . This is how a person 's life should be : a slow process of adaptation to whatever circumstances that might arise . When the river meets an obstacle , a range of hills or a huge rock , it gently flows around it : but when it arrives at an abrupt drop , a steep decline of the surface , then it shoots straight ahead and throws itself in thundering falls and rapids over the boulders , only to expand again peaceably after it has reached flat ground . This is the way life ought to be . It should adapt itself , it must avoid head - on collisions , but it should also be prepared to run risks and push straight ahead until the landscape opens up again and the current flows undisturbed . The river is life because water is life . In some languages of the north - west Amazon , the word for river or water is the same as the word for health , for medicine . When the Indians see stagnant , polluted waters they say the river is ill : but when the current is swift and clear the river is healthy . When a man works hard and perspires profusely he is in good health because then \" the water circulates \" , as the Indians say . On a higher level of abstraction , the river becomes a model of man 's process of spiritual development . It is what the Indians call \" the path \" , what other religions or philosophies would call tao , the Way to Perfection , to fulfilment , to oblivion . In fact , in the shamanic idiom , the Vaup\u00e9s river is called \" river of transformation \" . We all have been marked by a cheap stereotype of Amazonian Indians : a man or a family peacefully paddling a canoe . But to the Indians , the meaning of this picture is immensely more complex . River travel is life but it is much more than life . On the river , man finds food ; it is there he meets his kinsmen and where he meets women ; it is on the river that he listens to the sounds of the waters and the forests and , often , it is on the river that he meets his death . River travel , the image of man penetrating upriver , over rapids and falls , over whirlpools and from one bend of the river to another , constitutes a recurrent visionary theme in dreams , hallucinations and myths . And then there is the forest . The forest has different dimensions ; it offers other resources and all of these have their spirit-owners and therefore require different behavioural norms . Above all , there are the game animals . Between the hunter and the animals he kills , there exists a relationship of reciprocity . The spirits of dead or frightened animals take their revenge by causing illness to the hunter and his family . In fact , the animals are \" hunters \" in their own right , in that they \" hunt \" people with diseases , accidents and nightmares . In order to establish and maintain a viable relationship between the hunter and the hunted , people must observe many dietary and sexual restrictions . The former have two complementary functions : on the one hand they act as controls , as deterrents to over-hunting ; on the other hand , they serve to mask human body odours . The consumption of peppers , for example , or the smoke of burning pitch will make the game animals disregard any human scent while the consumption of fatty or oily substances \" makes the hunter visible \" ( as the Indians say ) by his strong body odour . To the Indians of the north - west Amazon , the river and the forest are living organisms , kept alive and fertile by the cosmic energy of the Sun Father . This father figure is in continuous exchange with our Earth , which is a female principle . Between the two - solar energy and the Earth 's fertility potential - exists a circuit ; whatever man subtracts from it for his sustenance , be it fishing , hunting or harvesting , he must return by saving energy through personal sacrifice . This principle of \" saving \" is reflected in the conscious and planned conservation of natural resources . Must adult people are quite aware of this principle , but the true power of planning and decision - making in these ecological matters lies in the hands of shamans and elders . I have seen shamans carefully measuring out the adequate amount of fish poison to be put in a creek ; I have heard them interpret dreams in terms of game conservation , explaining that the frightening appearance in a dream , of a certain animal , was a warning that the species was being over-hunted . Shamans will control the felling of trees , the firing of clearings ; they will control house construction , canoe making , the brewing of beer , the processes of daily food preparation , and a great multitude of other activities . In the evening , the men will sit around their fires and talk , and in these nightly conversations they will refer to the change of seasons , the appearing in the sky , the water level and the current of the rivers and creeks , the animals they have seen and heard , the fruits that are ripening in the fields or in the forest . Every few weeks there will be a slight change in the subject matter of these nightly talks , and the seasonal cycle or rainy or dry months will mark major changes in emphasis . There will he talk of bird migrations and of fish runs ; fields must he fired and planted . And night after night people talk while the shamans and elders listen and occasionally ask some questions . In the shamans ' minds , all this information will be organised into structured knowledge which henceforward , for the next few weeks , determines their activities , be they expressed in ritual , in recommending hunting strategies or in arranging social gatherings . For each season of the year , for each distinct shorter time - span , and for each ecosystem , all behavioural norms have to be re-adapted and co-ordinated anew . And this is why the Indians ' knowledge is so vital . The great \" energy \" potential of soils , plants , game animals and fish has to he redistributed to the cosmic energy circuit by rituals , recitals , myths and admonitions which , in their totality , prescribe a way of life . If observed in their full context , these norms constitute an integrated system . For thousands of years , the Amazon Basin has been inhabited by Indians who knew how to conserve their habitat ; we have archaeological evidence for their demographic density and the cultural inventiveness of these peoples . Of course , I am quite aware of the fact that , occasionally , the Indians have contributed to the destruction and degradation of their lands , especially when acting under the pressure of encroaching mestizo peasants , but as a general rule they have managed their natural environment with ecologically - sound land use planning . But the pressure of outside forces upon the Amazon environment is increasing day by day . In the course of my travels , and of long years of field experience in Colombia , I have seen many irreparable changes in the natural environment brought about by human agency ; I have seen the ancient deserts of central Asia and I have seen the rapid expansion of modern deserts on the plains and mountains of Colombia . But no single case has impressed me more than what is happening , and what might be happening , in the Amazon Basin . In speaking of Colombian Indians , I have mentioned some isolated customs ; some animistic beliefs and shamanistic images such as might be described for many aboriginal societies of the tropical rainforest or the Andes . But what I want to emphasise is this : these beliefs and attitudes toward life , these visions of the universe , these hundreds of little things a person does or thinks or avoids , form a highly - structured order . In myth and ritual , in conversation and daily activities , the Indians express deeply - felt beliefs . During an Indian 's entire life , there is a constant , more or less conscious , interplay between the individual and the way in which he perceives the environment . There are shapes and colours , movements and gestures , sounds and smells ; there are different temperatures , different flavours to taste , things to touch , air to breathe . There is the power of the spoken word , the rhythm of music , the bond of kinship . All these manifold sensations , perceptions and feelings are consistently coded and carry specific meanings , the total message of which is life - a well - adapted life . Every single musical instrument , every single feather in a headdress , every dance - step or body gesture is imbued with a specific meaning . And to these are added dietary restrictions , the rules of food processing , hunting and fishing , the clearing of a field , the firing of a clay vessel or the manufacture of a basket . And then there are dreams and visions , visions induced by the controlled use of hallucinogenic drugs , or by deep meditation ; and from these visions , a person awakes with the certainty that what he has seen or heard and felt in that other dimension was true . The sounds of the river and the forest , at different times of day or night , may he warnings or encouragements ; the screech of a parrot , the eyespot pattern on a fish tail , the smell of rotten wood or of an aromatic herb may determine a man 's activities and thought for a day or a week . In this manner the person is continuously exposed to messages which , in all essence , are of a biological nature because they mainly refer to the following rules : to find the right person to marry , to find the right food to eat , and to obtain both in the right way , without upsetting the balance - \" the energy - circuit \" - that links man to his society and his environment . How to read the signals the environment is sending out , a person has to learn through myth and ritual , through the long recitals of genealogies , the casting of spells , and above all , through the nightlong conversations of shamans and elders who are the true suppliers and transmitters of knowledge made wisdom . We should never underestimate this learning process , because it is an exacting mental discipline which eventually enables people to live in nature and with nature , and in society . Our cosmovision is based upon our science ; the Indians ' is based upon their knowledge . Of course , we want to continue in our world which , for better or for worse , is our creation . But in order to live in it , here , today , tomorrow and in the future , we need the Indian 's knowledge . And here I am referring not only to the practical knowledge of the Indians , to the sort of things a peasant knows . What I am trying to say is that the Indians ' way of life reveals to us the possibility of a separate strategy of cultural development ; in other words , it presents us with alternatives on an intellectual level and on a philosophical level . We should keep in mind these alternative cognitive models . The conservation of the Amazonian is not a visionary scheme of ecologists and romanticising anthropologists ; it is a vital necessity for mankind on a global scale : for the study of biological evolution , the study of soil - plant co-evolution , the study of species diversity ; to understand the linguistic , ethnographic , and biological diversity of human societies . We need the Amazon for its enormous human potential , quite apart from its economic or technological promises . Up to this point , I have been writing this article as a humanist , as an intellectual , as an anthropologist who is profoundly concerned about the future of the Indians and their natural environment . But now I shall begin to write as a rationalist too : as a person who is acutely aware of the realities of our present times , and who knows that the future lies in the hands of the intelligentsia , of the technologists and bureaucrats . It is they who have the power , and according to them the Indians are primitives who have to be integrated ; according to them , nature is something that has to he exploited for the benefit of man . We may know that we need the Indians ; we may know that the ruthless exploitation of natural resources has limits ; but the leading intelligentsia and their development agencies recognise no limits to their all - embracing technology . We have to be realistic , and accept the fact that the Indian world is on the wane . The Amazon basin and many , many other , formerly remote , regions of the Third World are being opened to outside influences and to technological development . In some regions this process will be slower and less turbulent than in others ; some aboriginal societies will he able to re-adapt , but others will become profoundly modified , and some will perish altogether , biologically , culturally , linguistically . As anthropologists and biologists , we know only too well that these changes are part of the historical scheme of things . These are disturbing thoughts , to say the least , and I wish I could be more positive when thinking of the future of rainforest Indians and aboriginal peoples in general . But in fitly y ears , I have seen too many traditions being lost ; I have seen entire tribes disappear ; I have seen too much misery among gentle , helpless people . Although I know that the Indians ' world is on the wane , I believe that this knowledge does not exempt us from certain obligations . So , here , I shall attempt to suggest a few approaches to these problems ; I shall try to make an effort to envisage a better future for the Indians , by suggesting a few personal ideas . In the first place , I think we should make a combined effort to study the Indians ' knowledge of their biotype , taking into account not only our , but above all their , concepts of ecosystems . Every square kilometre of forest contains a library of important biological , cultural and psychological information , and if we study it in the company of the Indians our insights in all these fields will be enormously enriched . The death of an old Indian who never had the chance to share with us his knowledge of the forest and the river is the equivalent of a whole library disappearing . If we undertake this study alone , we will get a mere inventory but if we work together with the Indians our insights will be greatly enriched by a kind of knowledge which , at present , still lies beyond our experience . For 500 years we have witnessed and played along with , the destruction of the Indians ; now we are witnessing the destruction of the natural habitat . What are we waiting for ? There can also be no doubt that as anthropologists , biologists and ecologists we possess an enormous amount of information , or practical field experience , and of the many forms of human vulnerability and of the destruction of the natural environment . By transforming this information into practical knowledge , in a manner that would make it understandable and convincing to national leaders and planning agencies , we can influence the process of decision - making ; we can convince those in power of the biological and social necessity to Conserve these lands ; and we can convince them of the dignity and value of our Indian societies . It is not sufficient to say that what we owe to the Indians is potatoes , maize and quinine . It is not sufficient to retell their myths and tales in florid Portuguese or Spanish or to stage their dances in a pseudo-Indian setting on television . What we must show is the Indian 's philosophy of life , their cosmogonic and cosmological schemes , their ethical and aesthetical attitudes . What we must show is their courage of choice , their option of other ways of life , different from ours ; the courage and genius of having built their societies , their cultures based upon an astonishing combination of realism and imagery ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Subs : Mitchley , Stonehouse , Cain , Collett . DARLINGTON manager Mark Cooper opted for a 4 - 3 - 3 formation with striker Campbell recalled to play alongside Moore and Wright . But before they could get into their stride , they had keeper Russell to thank for being alert enough to race out of his area to clear from former Boro striker Connor , who had recovered froma calf injury to play , after Murray 's pass sent him clear of the Darlington defence . Mansfield looked the livelier side early on , but Campbell won the game 's first corner for Darlington on 11 minutes . Brown swung it in and Marriott did well to punch clear as Hatch closed in . Back came Darlington and Moore 's cross from the right struck the outside of the post , though Marriott was standing right on the post and appeared to have the ball covered . There was a cracking atmosphere with both sets of fans making plenty of noise , though Mansfield had more of them . Quakers were now starting to dictate play , but Mansfiueld won an 18th minute corner off Hatch . Former Quakers skipper Foster rose well to meet it but headed over the bar Hatch then halted Connor with a timely tackle as Mansfield tried to turn the screw . Brown then conceded another corner , though Darlington broke swiftly , Smith setting up Wright who fired over from 20 yards . Both sides werev trying to get the ball forward quickly , though play was halted when Smith took a heavy knock and needed treatment . The sides were happy for a breather on a warm humid day . Smith recovered and broke into the Mansfield penalty area on 32 minutes . He appeared to be brought down by Briscoe , but referee Stuart Attwell , who was well placed , felt otherwise . Marriott saved Moore 's header from a cross by Brown , then after good work from Chandler Bridge - Wilkinson was given space to cross , but sent the ball too close to Marriott . Darlington sufferede a blow on 38 minutes when Smith , who had been lively in midfield , limped off to be replaced by Verma . Hatch , playing as a stand - in central defender for Darlington , then presented te ball to Connor but was baled out by skipper Miller who got back swiftly to concede a corner . Then Russell had to go down smartly to save Adam Smith 's long range shot in first half stoppage time . Darlington needed more mobility from strikers Wright and Campbell but Mansfield threatened first in the second period , iod iod od d Smith firing a low shot wide of the near post after good work from Connor . Then Briscoe outmuscled Brown and saw his drive deflected narrowly over the bar , the closest either side had come so far . At the other end Brown 's free kick on 56 minutes was comfortably held by Marriott . But twice within a minute Quakers missed gilt edged chances . Campbell broke clear down the left and cossed low for Wright who took too long and Mansfield cleared for a corner . From it Bridge - Wilkinson found Miller breaking into space but the skipper misdirected his header which drifted harmlessly wide . The game had opened up now with both sides shedding their inhibitions . On 62 minutes Russell was down smartly to keep out Connor 's low shot from 12 yards , as Mansfield linked well in attack . Quakers broke through Brown , whose cross was met by Wright , but Marriott climbed well to pluck the ball out of the air before Campbell could latch onto it . It was looking increasingly likely that one goal would settle it . But Darlington in particular needed better delivery into the penalty area as they had wasted some good positions , though Verma was not far off target with a rising drive from 20 yards . With 16 minutes remaining Darlington brought on Senior for Campbell to try and pep up theior attack , and Marriott had to scramble to prevent his low coss from reaching Wright in front of goal . Darlington looked the more likely scorers now , but they had to be wary at the back as Mansfiled were linking up well in midfield at times . Going into the last 10 minutes the game was stretched , and itv was down to stamina and desire as to who would come out on top . Wright who was having more influnce now failed to get on the end of an Arnison free - kick into the heart of the penalty area . Then on 89 minutes when Verma was brought down 25 yards from goal , Bridge - Wilkinson struck the post from the free-kick . And there was still time for Bridge - Wilkinson to cross into the box where Wright headed wide with a diving attempt . Darlington tried to pick up the tempo again in extra time , and won a corner which was cleared . Senior won another corner as Darlington dictated . Mansfield cleared but Brown played the ball back in for Wright , who headed wide . Than Mansfield brought on Cain for Smith . Arnison conceded a free-kick for a high boot 30 yards from goal to give Mansfield a chance to play the ball into the penalty area . Cain took it and Darlington cleared only after a scramble . Drlington then played their final card , Terry coming on for Bridge -Wilkinson . The substitute played a good ball into the penalty area from which Wright headed narrowly wide , though he claimed that Marriott had got a touch . Early in the second half of extra time Terry released Senior whose shot was deflected into the grateful arms of Marriott . Darlington were dictating much of the play and Mansfield brought on Mitchley for Murray to try and gain some control . Wright went down injured and players from both sides went straight for the drinks bottles , while he recived treatment . Connor threatened when Cain ' s cross reached the far post where Connor headed narrowly over the bar . Then eight minutes from time Moore forced a Darlington corner . Brown too it and Wright headed against the post as Quakers agony continued . Hatch headed clar a corner from Cain in a rare Mansfield attack , as a penalty shoot out loomed . But Darlington snatched the FA Trophy in the last when another Wright header hit the bar and looped into the air and this time the smallest man on the pitch , Senior headed home to send his teammates and the Darlington fans wild with delight ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

' or visit the download page for other relevant documents . | | || | | | | || Why should I comply with the Code ? | | || The Association of Labour Providers is making compliance with the Code a condition of membership . The Fresh Produce Consortium and the National Farmers Union have urged their members to use only labour providers that comply with the code . To reinforce these commitments the supermarkets are actively encouraging all suppliers to use only labour providers who are working to comply with the code of practice . | | || | | | | || What happens when I register ? | | || Following registration , Labour providers must arrange to be audited against the Code by a firm of trained auditors and then agree a programme for rectifying any shortcomings that are identified . The audit will include a review of documentation , a physical inspection and worker interviews . | | || | | | | || Do I have to pay to become registered ? | | || Initial registration is free . However , the auditor 's fees must be borne by the Labour Provider . The audit is a thorough process and will take up to two days . | | || | | | | || How do I register ? | | || Initial registration can be completed online through this web site , or by downloading a registration form which should be completed and returned by fax or post to the registration secretary . Registration forms will also be available at the upcoming regional events which are being held to explain the Code and assist in your preparation for it , details of which will be published on this site . | | || | | | | || What will happen if I do n't register ? | | || As the Association of Labour Providers is making compliance with the Code a condition of membership and the Fresh Produce Consortium , the National Farmers Union and the supermarkets are all urging their members to use only labour providers that comply with the code , it is in your best interests to register . | | || | | | | || I trade under more than one name . Do I need just one audit ? | | || If you trade under more than one name then only the named company that is audited will qualify as registered and audited . Any other names or businesses run with only a partial link to the registered business will not qualify and will need to be audited separately . | | || | | | | || How do I find an auditor ? | | || We will be publishing a list of auditors trained in auditing against the Code of Practice on this web site in due course . You should use an auditor from this list . | | || | | | | || What happens after the audit ? | | || Any issues will be recorded in a Corrective Action Plan . If there are no critical non-compliances , your business will be listed and labour users will be able to identify that you have been audited and therefore reach a certain standard . If there are critical non- compliances then these will need to be addressed before the business can be listed on the site . | | || | | | | || Will the GLA recognise an audit ? | | || As a general rule the GLA will recognise successful audits against the TLWG code as counting towards a licence . ie. Labour Providers that have been audited successfully against the Code will not normally require to be audited again on application . However , the GLA reserves the right to require a further audit depending on : | - The age of the previous audit - The completeness of the original audit against the TLWG Code - The nature and degree of any unresolved non-compliances from the original audit | || | | |"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Zimbabwe update Jestina Mukoko released 2009-03-06 , Issue 422 http://pambazuka.org/en/category/zimbabwe/54628 Printer friendly version Human rights activist Jestina Mukoko was released on bail following three months of incarceration in Zimbabwe prisons . Africa Action welcomes this development and wishes to extend appreciation to hundreds of activists who responded to our calls over the last 3 months to take action demanding Jestina 's release . Jestina is ' free ' today due to the collective efforts of people of good conscience all over the world who stood in solidarity with her during months of unlawful incarceration . AFRICA ACTION WELCOMES JESTINA MUKOKO'S RELEASE Yesterday , human rights activist Jestina Mukoko was released on bail following three months of incarceration in Zimbabwe prisons . Africa Action welcomes this development and wishes to extend appreciation to hundreds of activists who responded to our calls over the last 3 months to take action demanding Jestina 's release . Jestina is ' free ' today due to the collective efforts of people of good conscience all over the world who stood in solidarity with her during months of unlawful incarceration . It is this outcry that made the government of Zimbabwe realize that the world is not just watching but is in fact , utterly outraged by cases of gross human rights violations . As we welcome Jestina 's release , we note with dismay that fabricated charges against her are still in place . We believe that these charges should be dropped immediately and Jestina must be allowed to go back to her life of civic activism without any intimidation or hindrance . Of great concern too is the fact that the government of Zimbabwe continues to hold other political prisoners . If the new inclusive government of Zimbabwe is serious , and wants to be taken seriously by the world its human rights , governance and democratic record must improve and that includes immediate release of all political prisoners . A notable case is that of Roy Bennett , the designate Deputy Minister for Agriculture in the inclusive government who has been in prison for almost a month now . Despite the fact that Roy Bennett was granted bail by the courts , he remains incarcerated because the government of Zimbabwe continues to manipulate the judicial system . All political detainees in Zimbabwe have told stories of torture and other forms of abuse at the hands of state agents . Jestina Mukoko had to be released to a hospital because of serious health problems from torture and horrible prison conditions . In the interest of justice , we believe that those responsible for torture and abuse must be brought to book . The culture of impunity by Zimbabwe 's police and other security agents must stop immediately if the inclusive government is to be taken seriously ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

I retain a true Sense of your kindnesses , and want nothing but oppertunity to give testimony of my willingness to oblige as far as my Life or fortune will extend . I cou'd not object to the Pay before I knew it . I dare say your Honour remembers the first Estimation allowd a Lieutt Colo. 15 / and Majr 12/6 which I then complaind very much off ; till your Honour assurd me that we were to be furnish 'd with proper necessary 's and offerd that as a reason why the pay was Less than British : 2 after this when you were so kind to preferr me to the Comn I now have , and at the same time acquainted me that I was to have but 12/6 \u2014 This , with some other Reason 's induced me to acquaint Colo . Fairfax with my intention of Resigning , which he must well remember as it happd at Belhaven ; 3 and was there that he disswaded me from it and promised to represent the trifling pay to your Honour , who would endeavour ( as I at the same time told him that the Speaker 4 thought the Officr 's pay too small ) to have it enlarg'd . As to the Number 's that applied for Commission 's and to whom we were preffer 'd ; I believe , had those Gentlemen been as knowing of this Country , and as Sensible of the difficulties that would attend a Campaign here as I then was \u2014 I concive your Honour wd not have been so troublesomly sollicited as you were ; yet , I do not offer this as a reason for quitting the Service . for my own part I can answer , I have a Constitution hardy enough to encounter and undergo the most severe tryals , and I flatter myself resolution to Face what any Man durst , as shall be prov'd when it comes to the Test , which I believe we are upon the Border 's off . There is nothing Sir ( I believe ) more certain than that the Officer 's on the Canada Expedition had British pay allowd , whilst they were in the Service , 5 Lieutt Wag [ gene ] r Captn Trent , and several other 's whom I have conversed with on tht Head , and were engagd in it , affirm it for truth : therefore Honble Sir , as this ca n't be allow'd ; suffer me to serve a Volunteer which I assure you will be the next reward to British pay , for As my Services , so far as I have knowledge will equal those of the best Officer , I make it a point of Honr to serve for less and accept a medium . Nevertheless , I have communicated your Honour 's Sentiments to them ; and as far as I could put on the Hipocrite , set forth the advantages that may accrue , and advis 'd them to accept the Terms , as a refusal might reflect dishonour upon their Character ; leaving it to the World to assign what reason 's they please for quitting the Service \u2014 I am very sensible of the pernicious consequenc\u27e8e\u27e9 that will attend their resigning , as they have by this gain 'd some experience of the Military Art , have a tolerable knowledge of the Country , being sent most of them out at different times with partys : and now are accustom'd to the hardships and fatiegue of Living as we do , which I believe were it truely stated , wd prevent your Honour from many troublesome Sollicitations from others for Comn\u27e8s\u27e9 [ . ] This last motive , has , and will induce me to do what I can to reconcile matter 's ; th\u00f4 I really believe there is some tht will not remain long witht an alteration . They have promis'd to consider of it , and give your Honour an answer . I was not ignorant of the allowe which Colo . Fry has for his Table , 6 but being a dependt there myself deprives me of the pleasure of inviting an Officer or Friend , which to me wd be more agreeable than the Nick Nacks I shall meet with there . And here I cannot forbear answering one thing more in your Honrs Letter on this head ; which ( too ) is more fully express 'd in a paragraph of Colo . Fairfax 's to me as follows \u201c If on the British Establishment Officer 's are allowd more Pay , the Regimentals they are oblig 'd annually to furnish , their necessary Table and other Incidents being considerd , little or no savings will be their Portion \u201d 7 \u2014 I believe it is well known we have been at the expence of Regimentals ( and it is still better known , that Regimentals , and every other necessary that we were under an indispensable necessity of purchasing for this Expedition , were not to be bought for less Virga curr [enc ]y , than British Officer 's cd get for sterling money ; 8 which they ought to have been , to put us upon a parity in this respect , then Colo . Fairfax observes that their Table and other Incident charges prevents them frm saving much : if they dont save much , they have the enjoyment of their Pay which we neither have in one sense nor the other : We are debarr 'd the pleasure of good Living , which Sir ( I dare say with me you will concur ) to one who has always been used to it ; must go somewhat hard to be confin'd to a little salt provision and Water : and do duty , hard , laborious duty that is almost inconsistent with that of a Soldier , and yet have the same Reductions as if we were allowd luxuriously : My Pay accordg to the British Establisht & common exchange is near 22 / pr Day , in the R[ oo ] m of that the Committee ( for I ca n't in the least imagine yr Hr had any h[ an ] d in it ) has provided 12/6 so long as the Service requires me , whereas , one half of the other is ascertain'd to the British Officer 's forever : now if we shd be fortunate enough to drive the French from Ohio \u2014 as far as your Honour wd please have them sent to \u2014 in any short time , our Pay will not be sufficient to discharge our first expences . I would not have your Honour imagine from this , that I have said all these things to have the Pay encreas 'd \u2014 but to justify myself , and shew your Honour that our complaints are not frivolous , but are founded upon strict Reason : for my own part , it is a matter almost indefferent whether I serve for full pay , or as a generous Volunteer ; indeed , did my circumstances corrispond with my Inclination , I shd not hesitate a moment to prefer the Latter : for the motives that lead me here were pure and Noble I had no view of acquisition but that of Honour , by serving faithfully my King and Country . As your Honour has recommended Mr Willis you may depend I shall with pleasure do all that I can for him . But above all Sir , you may depend I shall take all possible means of procureing intelligence , and guarding against surprises , and be assur 'd nothing but very unequal number 's shall engage me to submit or Retreat . Now Sir , as I have answer 'd your Honour 's Letter I shall beg leave to acqt you with what has happen'd since I wrote by Mr Gist ;9 I then acquainted you that I had detach 'd a party of 75 Men to meet with 50 of the French who we had Intelligence were upon their March towards us to Reconnoitre &ca [ . ] Abt 9 Oclock the same Night , I receivd an express from the Half King who was Incampd with several of His People abt 6 Miles of , that he had seen the Tract of two French Men xing the Road and believ'd the whole body were lying not far off , as he had an acct of that number passing Mr Gist \u2014 I set out with 40 Men before 10 , and was from that time till near Sun rise before we reach 'd the Indian 's Camp , havg Marched in small path , & heavy Rain , and a Night as Dark as it is possible to concieve \u2014 we were frequently tumbling one over another , and often so lost that 15 or 20 Minutes search would not find the path again . When we came to the Half King I council 'd with him , and got his assent to go hand in hand and strike the French . accordingly , himself , Monacatoocha , and a few other Indians set out with us , and when we came to the place where the Tracts were , the Half King sent Two Indians to follow their Tract and discover their lodgment which they did abt half a mile from the Road in a very obscure place surrounded with Rocks . 10 I thereupon in conjuction with the Half King & Monacatoocha , formd a disposion to attack them on all sides , which we accordingly did and after an Engagement of abt 15 Minutes we killd 10 , wounded one and took 21 Prisoner 's , 11 amongst those that were killd was Monsieur De Jumonville the Commander , Principl Officers taken is Monsieur Druillong and Monsr Laforc , who your Honour has often heard me speak of as a bold Enterprising Man , and a person of gt subtilty and cunning with these are two Cadets \u2014 These Officers pretend they were coming on an Embassy , but the absurdity of this pretext is too glaring as your Honour will see by the Instructions and summons inclos 'd : 12 There Instructions were to reconnoitre the Country , Roads , Creeks &ca to Potomack ; which they were abt to do , These Enterpriseing Men were purposely choose out to get intelligence , which they were to send Back by some brisk dispatches with mention of the Day that they were to serve the Summon's ; which could be through no other view , than to get sufficient Reinforcements to fall upon us imediately after . This with several other Reasons induc 'd all the Officers to beleive firmly that they were sent as spys rather than any thing else , and has occasiond my sending them as prisoners , tho they expected ( or at least had some faint hope of being continued as ambassadors ) They finding where we were Incamp 'd , instead of coming up in a Publick manner sought out one of the most secret Retirements ; fitter for a Deserter than an Ambassador to incamp in \u2014 s [ t ] ayd there two or 3 days sent Spies to Reconnoitre our Camp as we are told , tho they deny it \u2014 Their whole Body movd back near 2 Miles , sent off two runnors to acquaint Contracoeur with our Strength , and where we were Incamp 'd &ca now 36 Men wd almost have been a Retinue for a Princely Ambassador , instead of Petit , why did they , if there design 's were open stay so long within 5 Miles of us witht delivering his Ambassy , or acquainting me with it ; his waiting cd be with no other design than to get Detachts to enforce the Summons as soon as it was given , they had no occasion to send out Spy's ; for the Name of Ambassador is Sacred among all Nations ; but it was by the Tract of these Spy 's they were discoverd , and we got Intilligence of them \u2014 They wd not have retird two Miles back witht delivering the Summons and sought a sculking place ( which to do them justice was done with gt Judgment ) but for some especial Reason : Besides The Summon 's is so insolent , & savour 's so much of Gascoigny that if two Men only had come openly to deliver it . 13 It was too great Indulgence to have sent them back . The Sense of the Half King on this Subject is , that they have bad Hearts , and that this is a mere pretence , they never designd to have come to us but in a hostile manner , and if we were so foolish as to let them go again , he never would assist us in taking another of them [ . ] 14 Besides , looseing La Force I really think wd tend more to our disservice than 50 other Men , as he is a person whose active Spirit , leads him into all parlys , and brought him acquainted with all parts , add to this a perfect use of the Indian Tongue , and gt influence with the Indian He Ingenuously enough confessd that as soon as he saw the commission & Instructions that he believd and then said he expected some such tendency tho he pretends to say he does not believe the Commander had any other but a good design .

Joseph Coulon de Villiers , sieur de Jumonville ( 1718 \u2013 1754 ) , a 16 \u2013 year veteran of the French army in America , held the rank of ensign and in 1754 was assigned to Fort Duquesne . Ordered by the sieur de Contrecoeur to carry a \u201c summons \u201d to the English to vacate the Ohio country , he left the fort on 23 May in command of approximately 35 men . Among his officers was Pierre Jacques Drouillon ( Druillon ) , sieur de Mac\u00e9 ( b. 1725 ) , also an ensign , who returned to Canada after he was freed and became a lieutenant in the French army in 1759 . For La Force , see William Trent to GW , 19 Feb. 1754 , n.5 . The two cadets were named de Boucherville and Dusabl\u00e9 . The controversy concerning GW 's engagement with Jumonville has persisted until recent times . The French claimed that Jumonville 's role was that of ambassador and that while on a peaceful mission , similar to GW 's own mission to the French commandant a few months before , he and his party were ambushed by the Virginia troops . Contrecoeur recounted what was to become the French version of the affair in a letter to Duquesne , 2 June 1754 : \u201c I expected Mr. de Jumonville , within four Days ; the Indians have just now informed me , that that Party is taken and defeated ; they were Eight in Number , one whereof was Mr. de Jumonville . One of that Party , Monceau by Name , a Canadian , made his Escape , and tells us that they had built themselves Cabbins , in a low Bottom , where they sheltered themselves , as it rained hard . About seven o' Clock the next Morning , they saw themselves surrounded by the English on one Side and the Indians on the Other . The English gave them two Volleys , but the Indians did not fire . Mr. de Jumonville , by his Interpreter , told them to desist , that he had something to tell them . Upon which they ceased firing . Then Mr. de Jumonville ordered the Summons which I had sent them to retire , to be read . . . . The aforesaid Monceau , saw all our Frenchmen coming up close to Mr. de Jumonville , whilst they were reading the Summons , so that they were all in Platoons , between the English and the Indians , during which Time , said Monceau made the best of his Way to us , partly by Land through the Woods , and partly along the River Monaungahela , in a small Canoe . This is all , Sir , I could learn from said Monceau . The Misfortune is , that our People were surprized ; the English had incircled them , and came upon them unseen . . . . The Indians who were present when the Thing was done , say , that Mr. de Jumonville was killed by a Musket - Shot in the Head , whilst they were reading the Summons ; and that the English would afterwards have killed all our Men , had not the Indians who were present , by rushing in between them and the English , prevented their Design \u201d ( Memorial Containing a Summary View of Facts description begins [ Jacob Nicolas Moreau ] .

A copy of Contrecoeur 's instructions to Jumonville , 23 May 1754 , is in P.R.O. , C.O. 5/1328 , f. 118 . 14 . The role of the Indians in the engagement remains obscure . An eyewitness on the French side claimed the Indians did not fire and the French casualties were the result of British volleys ( see note 12 ) . Similarly in his diary GW stated that \u201c we killed Mr. de Jumonville . . . as also nine others . . . . The Indians scalped the Dead \u201d ( Diaries description begins Donald Jackson and Dorothy Twohig , eds . The Diaries of George Washington . 6 vols . Charlottesville , Va. , 1976\u201379 . description ends , 1 :195 ) . In a letter to the Board of Trade of 18 June 1754 , however , Dinwiddie wrote that \u201c this little Skirmish was by the Half - King & their Indians , we were as auxiliaries to them , as my Orders to the Commander of our Forces [ were ] to be on the Defensive \u201d ( P.R.O. , C.O. 5/1328 , ff. 117 , 120 ) . John Shaw , a veteran of the surrender at Fort Necessity , claimed that Jumonville was killed with a tomahawk by the Half - King who then scalped the French commander ( McDowell , S.C.

In Colonial Records of South Carolina , 2d ser. , vols. 2 \u20133 . description ends , 4 ) . That the Indians may have been responsible for at least some of the French deaths is suggested by the fact that the French force which marched out of Fort Duquesne on 28 June in pursuit of the English found when they reached the site of the skirmish that a number of bodies had been left unburied , a custom often adopted by Indians hoping to discourage their enemies ( \u201c Journal of M. de Villiers , \u201d Memorial Containing a Summary View of Facts description begins [ Jacob Nicolas Moreau ] .

In the early 1750s he supported the British , but after going over to the French probably in late 1754 , he became the scourge of English settlements along the Pennsylvania frontier . In 1754 he was living in the vicinity of McKee 's Rocks in Allegheny County , Pa. 18 . John West , Jr. ( d. 1777 ) , was a surveyor for Fairfax County . The date of his commission as the fourth lieutenant in the Virginia Regiment was 27 Feb. 1754 . He resigned his commission in late summer following this campaign .

He was killed with Braddock 's forces at the Battle of the Monongahela , 9 July 1755 . 20 . William La P\u00e9ronie , a Frenchman with military experience , came to Virginia about 1750 . His name is variously spelled , even , apparently , by La P\u00e9ronie himself . See for example , his letter to GW , 5 Sept. 1754 . After he was wounded in the engagement at Fort Necessity , Dinwiddie made him adjutant of the regiment on GW 's recommendation ( GW to Dinwiddie , 10 June 1754 ) .

The General Manager ( GM ) , Emeka Ugoanyanwu , stated , at the weekend , that the residents dump refuse , defecate , bury corpses and construct soak - away pit around the river . Also , the World Bank would start a project to provide safe water for Imo citizens by January . Ugoanyanwu disclosed this in Owerri , during a roundtable dialogue organised by Open Arms Initiative for Sustainable Development , with three monarchs from five autonomous communities in Owerri municipality in attendance .

His origins lay in ancient Egypt , like those of Hawkman and Fantomah . He was a crime - fighting magician like continued below | Mandrake and Zanzibar ; and also like them , did n't maintain a secret identity or wear a flashy costume while doing so . He did depart from the Mandrake mold by sporting a turban , but then , so did Mr. Mystic and Sargon the Sorcerer . Least unique of all , he was a comic book superhero who flourished in the early 1940s , and there were hundreds of others like that . | But he was among the more successful of the magician superheroes . In fact , having been in regular publication for more than 13 years , he was the most successful of all , other than Mandrake himself . Ibis was first seen in Whiz Comics # 2 , published by Fawcett Publications with a cover date of February , 1940 . His origin story was written by editor Bill Parker and drawn by C.C. Beck , just like those of Captain Marvel and Spy Smasher , which also appeared in Whiz # 2 , tho Parker and Beck both left the character early on . Ibis 's later writers and artists included , among others , Otto Binder ( Supergirl , Legion of Super Heroes ) and Pete Costanza ( who for years was Beck 's main assistant ) . Ibis 's original name , 4000 years ago when he was a prince of Egypt , was Amentep . He was in love with the beautiful Princess Taia of Thebes , but an evil magician calling himself The Black Pharoah kidnaped Taia and seized the throne , imprisoning Amentep as he did . Amentep 's uncle snuck a magic wand called the Ibistick to him , whereupon the prince became Ibis the Invincible . In the ensuing melee , Taia was struck by an arrow . Before she could die , Ibis used the wand to put her into suspended animation long enough for the wound to heal , then did the same to himself so he could be with her when she woke up . Both came to in 1940 , in separate museums , where they were being exhibited as mummies . They had little trouble getting together , and even less adapting to life in the 20th century , in which Ibis , his former occupation as an Egyptian prince no longer available to him , embarked on a new career of using the Ibistick to bash evil . Like a majority of the features starting in Whiz # 2 , Ibis proved popular enough to get his own comic . But it came out only sporadically , a total of six issues appearing between 1942 and ' 48 . He did , however , remain in the back pages of Whiz Comics as long as that title lasted , i.e. , until # 155 ( June , 1953 ) . After that , Fawcett got out of the comic book business . It continued to put out a variety of regular magazines , but its only foray back into comics publishing came several years later , when it licensed Hank Ketcham 's Dennis the Menace . Charlton Comics , which picked up several of Fawcett 's properties ( such as the horror title This Magazine Is Haunted and the western Lash Larue ) , apparently included Ibis among its acquisitions , as the magician starred in a cover- featured story in Charlton 's Danger & Adventure # 22 ( February 1955 ) , which also reprinted a Fawcett - published story about Nyoka the Jungle Girl . Later issues of Danger & Adventure featured other Fawcett characters , such as Lance O'Casey and Colonel Corn . Ibis may have made one or two other Charlton appearances , but bibliographic material is sketchy . Nonetheless , when , decades later , DC Comics acquired Fawcett 's old superhero characters , Ibis was included again \u2014 not a unique situation , as Fawcett was also apparently careless enough to have sold Hoppy the Marvel Bunny to both Charlton and DC . DC 's first use of Ibis was in a very crowded 1976 crossover involving The Justice League and Justice Society of America . Since then , he and Taia ( both now colored to better reflect their ancestry , as opposed to Fawcett 's standard Caucasian look ) have turned up occasionally as supporting characters for Captain Marvel and his entourage , the only Fawcett characters the company has made any great use of . Ibis has n't appeared under his own logo since the 1950s , and it seems unlikely he will in the future . \u2014 DDM BACK to Don Markstein 's Toonopedia Home Page Purchase DC Comics Archive Editions Online Purchase DC Comics Merchandise Online"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

His image , along with the ' saltire ' ( or diagonal cross ) associated with him , has been used for political as well as religious purposes from early medieval times until the present . According to the Gospels , Andrew was a fisherman from Galilee and the first disciple of Christ . He is believed to have been martyred by crucifixion in Patras ( now part of Greece ) on 30 November in the year AD 60 . It is thought that his remains were removed to Constantinople about AD 357 , but after Constantinople was sacked during the Fourth Crusade in 1204 , the relics at Constantinople were taken to the cathedral of St Andrew at Amalfi in Italy . | By this time the monastery of Kilrymont ( later St Andrews ) in Fife claimed to possess three fingers of the saint 's right hand , a part of one of his arms , one kneecap , and one of his teeth . It is possible that these were brought to Fife ( which was at that time part of the kingdom of the Picts ) from the neighbouring kingdom of Northumberland . Although veneration of St Andrew was particularly strong there , having been brought to England by St Augustine , it was St Andrews that became a popular pilgrimage destination after miracles were attributed to the saint . | | Cast of the seal of the Guardians of Scotland ( NAS reference RH17/1/17 ) Another explanation for the relics became current by the 12th century . In this version the bishop of Patras ( Saint Regulus ) removed the relics about AD345 , sailed beyond the Mediterranean and was shipwrecked at Kilrymont , where he founded a church . Early Scottish historians , such as Walter Bower and George Buchanan , relate that Saint Andrew appeared in a vision to the Pictish king ( Hungus or Angus ) , who was about to fight a major battle against the Saxon king ( Athelstan ) , and promised victory to the the Picts . The grateful king welcomed Regulus and the relics and endowed the fledgling church with the lands around the bay where the saint had landed . The main problem with this story is that the kings mentioned reigned in the 8th or 9th centuries , not the 4th . The Regulus legend was promoted by Scottish kings , nobles and churchmen from the 12th century onwards for political reasons . Scottish independence had come under threat from England since the late 11th century , and the Scottish Church was contesting a claim to primacy by the archbishop of York . Precedence and hierarchy were very important in the middle ages . By promoting the story of Saint Andrew 's choice of Scotland in the 4th century , the Scots acquired a top-rank patron saint , a separate identity from England , and a date for the supposed foundation of the Scottish Church , pre-dating the conversion of England and Ireland to Christianity by several centuries . | In the Wars of Independence , fought by Scotland in the 13th and 14th centuries , the Scots used the story as part of the diplomatic battle to persuade the papacy to recognise Scotland as an independent kingdom . Pope Boniface , in a papal bull of 1299 , demanded that Edward I of England end the war against Scotland , and reminded Edward how Scotland \" was converted , and won to the unity of the Christian faith , by the venerable relics of the blessed Apostle Andrew , with a great outpouring of the divine power . \" | It should come as no surprise therefore that reference is made to St Andrew in the most famous claim to Scottish self - determination and what is probably our greatest documentary treasure : the letter of the Barons of Scotland to Pope John XXII , sent in April or May 1320 , popularly known as the Declaration of Arbroath . The Declaration of Arbroath is written in Latin , but the English translation of the paragraph in question reads : \" The high qualities and deserts of these people , were they not otherwise manifest , gain glory enough from this : that the King of kings and Lord of lords , our Lord Jesus Christ , after his Passion and Resurrection , called them , even though settled in the uttermost parts of the earth , almost the first to His most holy faith . Nor would He have them confirmed in that faith by merely anyone but by the first of His Apostles - by calling , though second or third rank - the most gentle Saint Andrew , the Blessed Peter 's brother , and desired him to keep them under his protection as their patron for ever . \" The image of Saint Andrew thereafter came to symbolise Scotland and another 12th century legend - that the saint was crucified on a ' crux decussata ' ( an X -shaped cross ) - provided a simpler symbol . The Scottish heraldic term for such a cross is a ' saltire ' , from the old French word ' saultoir ' , meaning a type of stirrup . | || | Declaration of Arbroath ( NAS reference SP13 / 7 ) . Read more about the Declaration of Arbroath . It was used on seals in Scotland from about 1180 onwards , sometimes along with the lion rampant , which was the heraldic symbol of the Scottish crown . In 1286 , when Scotland was ruled by the Guardians of Scotland in the absence of a king , the saint was depicted on the Guardians ' seal , used to authenticate their legal documents and communications to the rest of Europe . The seal included the inscription : \" Andrea Scotis dux esto compatriotis \" ( Andrew be leader of the compatriot Scots ) .

He was a competitive surfer \u2014 ranked eighth in the world \u2014 and a California high - school teacher when , at age 26 , he enrolled in a two - week commercial design class . Discovering a new calling , he briefly enrolled at a commercial art school before working as a designer at a small surfer magazine , Self and Musician . He then spent four years as a part-time designer for the magazine Transworld Skateboarding , which enabled him to experiment . His characteristic chaotic spreads with overlapped photos and mixed and altered type fonts drew both admirers and detractors . Photographer Albert Watson , for example , declared , \u201c He uses type the way a painter uses paint , to create emotion , to express ideas . \u201d Others felt that the fractured presentation obscured the message it carried . In 1989 Carson became art director at the magazine Beach Culture . Although he produced only six issues before the journal folded , his work there earned him more than 150 design awards . By that time , Carson 's work had caught the eye of Marvin Scott Jarrett , publisher of the alternative - music magazine Ray Gun , and he hired Carson as art director in 1992 . Over the next three years , with the help of Carson 's radical design vision , Ray Gun 's circulation tripled . Because Carson 's work clearly appealed to a youthful readership , corporations such as Nike and Levi Strauss & Co. commissioned him to design print ads , and he also began directing television commercials . After leaving Ray Gun in 1995 , Carson established David Carson Design . The firm was instantly successful and attracted well - known , wealthy corporate clients . In 1995 Carson produced The End of Print : The Graphic Design of David Carson ( revised edition issued in 2000 as The End of Print : The Grafik Design of David Carson ) , the first comprehensive collection of his distinctive graphic imagery .

Musa Qala , once a key Nato position , is the second town in northern Helmand to fall to the Taliban in recent weeks . The group also captured Nawzad after intensifying attacks in the region . Musa Qala saw some of the fiercest clashes between Western forces and the Taliban following the American - led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 . Three US air strikes on Saturday around Musa Qala reportedly killed up to 40 Taliban fighters but the militants regrouped to push Afghan ground forces back . District governor Mohamad Sharif said he fled the district on Wednesday morning as the Taliban attacked . \" We left the district early in the morning because the Taliban were attacking from all sides , \" he told Reuters . \" We had asked for reinforcements for days but none arrived and this was what happened . \" In southern Helmand , also on Wednesday , two Nato soldiers were killed when two men in Afghan military uniforms opened fire on a vehicle at a military base . The nationalities of the victims are not known . Key strategic position Musa Qala was once a Taliban stronghold and centre of the country 's opium trade , but the defection of a local Taliban commander , Mullah Salaam , helped turn the tide in favour of Western forces . The town was recaptured in December 2007 after fierce fighting between the Taliban and Nato and Afghan forces and became a vital strategic position . UK forces led the counter - insurgency operations in Helmand during the protracted conflict with the Taliban and lost more than 400 soldiers there in the process . Now the Taliban have recaptured the key parts of the province , in the first summer fighting season since foreign troops formally stepped back from combat roles in the country . Violence has increased sharply across Afghanistan since most foreign forces withdrew in December , leaving only a small contingent of about 12,000 Nato troops to train Afghan forces . The Taliban have extended their influence in Helmand into isolated towns in the north of the province , where Afghan security forces are vulnerable to attack ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

The battalion was part of the 20th Brigade of the newly formed 7th Division . It completed basic training at Ingleburn before marching to Bathurst army camp to undergo subunit field training . In October the 20th Brigade , comprising the 2/13th , 2/15th , and 2/17th Battalions , sailed from Sydney Harbour for the Middle East . The brigade transferred to the newly formed 9th Division en route to Egypt . Arriving in November the battalion travelled by train to Palestine and went into camp at Kilo 89 . Early in March 1941 the 9th Division moved into Cyrenaica replacing the 6th Division going to Greece . The Axis were also reorganising their forces . German forces landed at Tripoli , bolstering the Italians , and advanced east . The British were forced to evacuate Benghazi and fall back to Tobruk , referred to as the \" Benghazi handicap \" . The 2/13th covered the division 's withdrawal . The 2/13th was first complete Australian unit to fight German troops during the Second World War . The battle took place at Er Regima on 4 April 1941 . The battalion was thinly spread along an 11 kilometre front against a German force of about 3,000 men . The battle began mid-afternoon and continued into the night . Outnumbered and vulnerable the battalion fought on until 10 pm before withdrawing . They initially moved of on foot but were soon picked up by trucks and driven 16 km east of Barce to rest . By 9 April the 2/13th joined the rest of the division at Tobruk . It helped defend the \" fortress \" for eight months , being the only Australian battalion to see out the siege . It planned to evacuate in October but was delayed when their convey was forced to turn back from enemy air attack . The battalion remained in Tobruk until the siege was lifted in December . The 9th Division returned to Palestine before going to Syria to perform garrison duties . The 2/13th rejoined the division at Lattakia . By July 1942 the war in North Africa was critical for the British Eighth Army . German and Italian forces had reached El Alamein , about seventy miles from Alexandria . The 9th Division rushed to Alamein and held the northern sector for almost four months while the Eighth Army reinforced under new a commander . The 2/13th reached the forward British defences in mid-July and moved to Tel El Eisa in early - August . It fought in the Alamein battle from 23 October to 5 November 1942 . The 9th Division was recalled to Australia to face a new enemy - the Japanese . The 2/13th left Egypt in January 1943 and disembarked at Sydney in February . After leave and jungle training on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland in August the battalion embarked for Milne Bay in Papua . On 4 September the battalion departed Milne Bay on landing craft and landed on Red Beach , north - west of Lae , without casualties . It carried out subsequent jungle operations until Lae fell 12 days later . The battalion also landed at Scarlet Beach near Finschhafen on 22 September , helping defend the area against Japanese counter-attack . The 2/13th returned to Australia in March 1944 , disembarking in Brisbane . After leave , it reformed at Ravenshoe and did not return to action until the final months of the war . Towards the end of April the 9th Division was transported to Morotai to prepare for amphibious landings on Borneo as part of the OBOE operations . The 2/13th landed at Brunei on 10 June before making another landing in the Miri-Lutong area ten days later . The battalion captured the Lutong airfield and oil tanks and moved inland along the Pujut Road to the Pujut oilfields . It then moved along Canada Hill to Lobang , where it remained until the end of the war . Following Japan 's surrender , the 2/13th 's ranks thinned , as men were discharged or transferred . The battalion moved to Luban in November and in December sailed to Australia to \" wind up \" in preparation for disbandment ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

The wreckage of his hotel lobby lay all around , with , as Willie John recalled it , pieces of tables , bits of chair and other furniture strewn about and , in the thick of it , \" a dozen drunken Lions , all out of their tree \" . He clenched his pipe between his teeth till its tip bobbed up towards his nose , then turned towards the hotel manager , who was , at that precise moment in the early hours of the morning , dripping wet and hopping up and down on one foot . \" What , \" Willie John said to the manager , \" seems to be the problem ? \" The Lions might have got away with it if it had n't been for Bobby Windsor . It would have had to have been Bobby . The Welsh hooker was one of those players who just could not help but take things a little too far . It was Bobby who took the blame when Tommy David 's bed was shoved out of a window on to the hotel awning down below . He had the misfortune to be standing in the shot when a local photographer took a snap of the scene . \" I was known as ' the fireman ' , \" Bobby said , \" because I was the one who put the fires out . \" Literally . That night , after the Lions ' 28 - 9 victory over South Africa in the second Test of 1974 , \" someone \" , Bobby remembered , \" had set light to a load of empty cardboard beer boxes . So I got the fire extinguisher off the wall , but I could n't get it to work . So I grabbed a hose pump and used that instead . \" Flushed with pride at having fulfilled his civic duty , Windsor was somewhat surprised to find himself being berated by the hotel manager across the pile of soggy , steaming cardboard . \" He was being a right prat , \" Bobby said . \" So I gave him a right good drenching as well . \" Roger Uttley , the English forward , was sober enough to know that he had better run and get the captain , Willie John . \" Roger was banging on my door at 3 am , shouting that there was a bit of trouble and I was needed downstairs . \" McBride strolled out , in his pants , pausing only to pick up his pipe because \" I never go anywhere without it , especially in times of crisis \" . \" In the midst of all this carnage there was an extremely irate hotel manager , shouting and screaming . \" For some reason , when Willie John , naked but for his pants and pipe , asked him what the matter was , the manager snapped and said he was going to call the police . \" Now , \" Willie John thought to himself , \" I 'd seen the riot police in operation in South Africa and did n't like the images my mind was conjuring up . I could see hordes of them rushing through the door and I did n't think they 'd be asking for autographs from these drunken idiots . \" Willie John paused and saw the next morning 's headlines in his mind . \" Drunken Lions darken rugby 's name \" . He considered the situation . Sucked on his pipe . \" Excuse me , but if you are going to get the police , \" he said to the manager with a smile , \" do you think there will be many of them ? \" That was that . The Lions left the next morning , but not before they had completed one last little ritual , every bit as entrenched in Lions tradition as the selection of an uncapped player : the tour manager handed over a cheque to compensate the hotel owner for all the damage done . Both those rituals are long gone now . This is the fifth Lions tour of the professional era , and the last uncapped player to be picked for the squad was Will Greenwood in 1997 . Back then , as Keith Wood has said , \" the game had just turned professional , but there was still a lot of the amateur ethos \" . It was just wild enough to make the current trip to Australia seem pretty tame . The prop Adam Jones has described his average day in the camp before this tour as \" Wake up . Cryotherapy . Breakfast . Train . Cryotherapy . Lunch . Train. Cryotherapy . Dinner . Sleep . \" The dullest boys on tour , Jones says , are the teetotallers , who include the captain , Sam Warburton . Brian O'Driscoll says the only chance the drinkers do have to \" unwind and have a few beers together \" is on the evening after an afternoon kick -off . After the 22 - 12 win against Queensland Reds , he said , \" the non- playing 23 went home early . By the time the others got in , it was midnight . Some of the boys were already in bed . It is not as conducive to hanging out after games . \" Quite right too . Modern media coverage does not allow players to get away with much , and professionalism means that even if they could , many of them would n't want to . Under Gatland and Warburton , the Welsh turned all - but teetotal at the 2011 World Cup , allowing those who \" feel they need it \" a \" bottle or two \" of beer after a match to relax . You could n't wring too many war stories out of all that on the after-dinner speaking circuit . But everyone remembers England 's dwarf - tossing , ferry -diving escapades . Most people wo n't need reminding , either , which team was two points away from making the final and which was dumped out in disgrace in the quarters . The Lions , though , have seen it all before . When they toured New Zealand in 1908 the English forward Percy Down took a dive off the side of a ferry in the very same spot as Manu Tuilagi did , in Auckland harbour 103 years later . Down did a somersault over the railing . The main difference was that six of his team - mates followed him overboard , one of them giving himself such a bad case of concussion as he hit the water that he missed the next match . By then the Lions already had a reputation for making trouble . On their very first tour , in 1888 , the local papers in Australia carried reports complaining about their \" Rowdyism on the Railway \" between Newcastle and Armidale , when \" three galoots invaded a private first class carriage , guzzled tea without paying , smashed the cups and saucers , and left the solitary passenger to stand the racket \" . So began 109 years of raising Cain . The 1968 Lions were accused of being the \" worst - behaved team ever to tour South Africa \" by the Johannesburg Sunday Times . The sage rugby writer JBG Thomas refuted this on the grounds that , unlike at least one lot of their predecessors , \" they have never set fire to a railway carriage \" . That may have been true . But a couple of them did incinerate a pile of blazers belonging to their team - mates in a bonfire on the tarmac at Kimberley airport after what was described as an \" airborne cheese and wine party \" . \" They have left a trail of havoc and stunned incredulity after three days in East London , \" thundered the Sunday Times . \" Marked by severe drinking bouts , riotous behaviour at hotels and nightclubs . They left broken hotel doors , broken glasses by the dozen , unpaid liquor debts and girls in tears because of outright rudeness . \" In New Zealand in 1977 the local girls were crying again , out of boredom rather than rudeness . That was the tour when the infamous \" Wanda from Wanganui \" told the press that she had slept with four of the tourists and found them to be \" lousy lovers , boring , self - centred , ruthless , always on the make and anything but exciting bedmates . Give me the down to earth Kiwi male any day \" . The squad were called a \" pack of animals \" on that trip , which was the tour which featured the Irish pair of Moss Keane , nicknamed \" rent -a-storm \" , and Willie Duggan , perhaps the last of the real hell - raisers . Duggan had what he called \" a pathological dislike of training \" , his one concession to fitness being a breakfast of half a dozen raw eggs on the morning of the match . Ollie Campbell remembers how he used to be able to tell which dressing room toilet Duggan was in before a match by the clouds of smoke billowing over the cubicle door . \" I always had the philosophy , \" Duggan said , \" that if you took 30 players out for a night and made sure they were well pissed before they went to bed at 3 am , then got them up at 8 am , trained the bejaysus out of them , then you would know who was up to lasting 80 minutes in an international . \" Duggan 's great mate Keane would have passed easily enough . Keane cultivated a fear of flying just so , his team - mates reckoned , it was taken for granted that he had to have five or six pints before he got on a plane or he would n't be able to travel . In 1977 he was in such a state when he got a last - minute call - up that he had a crash on the way to the airport , then left a message for his mother saying \" the car is at the airport , it 's written off , see you in four months \" . The king of them all , though , was Blair \" Paddy \" Mayne , a man who has every claim to being the hardest-drinking , free-est-swinging firebrand in the long history of the Lions . Mayne was an Irish lock , and one- time university heavyweight boxing champion . He toured in 1938 , when his great running gag , the centre Harry McKibbin said , was to burst into his team - mates ' rooms in the middle of the night , knocking the doors off the hinges , and then systematically smash up all furniture , Keith Moon-style . \" Until , \" McKibbin said , \" all the chairs and tables and things were just so much bits of kindling around us in the room while we were still in bed . \" The management despaired of Mayne , who used to run around with the Welsh hooker ( what is it about Welsh hookers ? ) Bunner Travers . The two of them dressed up as sailors and snuck off to the Durban docks just so they could pick fights with the local longshoremen . When they got to Ellis Park , they found that the stands were being erected by a team of convicts from the local prison who were sleeping in a compound underneath the scaffolding . Blair and Bunner befriended one of them , and asked him what he had done to merit a prison sentence . \" Stealing chickens , \" he said . \" And I 've been given a seven - year stretch . \" Full of sympathy for their new companion , who they nicknamed \" Rooster \" , Blair and Bunner returned that night with a pair of bolt cutters and some spare clothes . They sprung Rooster , and set him free . When he was caught the next day , it turned out the jacket he was wearing still had Mayne 's name stitched inside the collar . In desperation , the management decided to make Mayne share a room with the fly-half George Cromey , who also happened to be a Presbyterian minister . Even Cromey could n't stop Mayne sneaking off from an official dinner to go on a late - night hunting trip with a group of men he 'd met who were carrying rifles and lamplights . Cromey waited up for his room - mate till 3 am , and then , just as he was nodding off , Mayne broke down the door and announced \" I 've just shot a springbok \" . Cromey said his blood ran cold . And then he turned on the light , and saw Mayne , still wearing his cummerbund , with a dead antelope draped over his shoulders . \" Jimmy Unwin has been complaining that the meat here is n't as fresh as it is back home , \" Mayne announced . So he took himself off to his team - mate Unwin 's room , broke down that door too , and tossed the beast into his bed . The trouble was that , in all the confusion , Unwin cut his leg on the antelope 's horn . That would n't do . So Mayne decided to deposit it outside the room of the South Africa manager , with a note saying : \" A gift of fresh meat from the British Isles touring team . \" Well , that did it . Even though the captain , Sammy Walker , was a great friend of his , Mayne knew that the management were going to tan his hide for that . So he scarpered . The team did n't see him for three days , till he turned up , still in his suit , to meet them on board the ship they were sailing home on . And if those stories sound a little far-fetched , as though , like all the best tales , they have gained a little in the telling , well , they 've nothing on what he did next . Mayne became one of the founding members of the SAS in the second world war . He was recruited out of a prison cell , where he had been sent after striking a senior officer \" because he bored me \" . His bravery won him the Distinguished Service Order with three bars , the L\u00e9gion d'honneur , and the Croix de Guerre . Rugby has gained a lot from professionalism but it has a lost a little something too .

Alderman James \u201c Ricky \u201d Gray brought up the issue at last week 's Natchez Board of Aldermen meeting . Gray said the memorial to the 1940 tragedy that killed 209 people should be moved to the club 's original site on St. Catherine Street . The Natchez Civic and Social Club of Chicago privately funded the memorial , which has sat between the gazebo and Silver Street on the bluff since 1940 , said Darrell White , director of the Natchez cultural heritage tourism and the Natchez Association for the Preservation of Afro-American Museum . Major Jake Middleton said at Tuesday 's meeting that he has met with Monroe Sago , the owner of the recently erected Rhythm Night Club Museum about the memorial 's location . Middleton said Sago asked if it was possible to move the marker to the original site , where the museum sits . Sago told the mayor the Mississippi Department of Historic Archives and History indicated the city had jurisdiction over deciding if the monument could be moved , Middleton said . The Natchez Monument Company assessed the monument at the mayor 's request and determined the 70- year - old structure could probably not sustain a move , Middleton said . Middleton said Monday that the issue has become a moot point as far as relocating the monument , but that it 's possible the city could consider placing some other placard with the victims ' names or a smaller monument at the original site . Natchez National Historical Park Superintendent Kathleen Jenkins said the group in Chicago likely had relatives or knew some of the victims in the fire . She said the great migration , which ended a decade before the fire , likely brought many black Natchezians to the cities in the Midwest , such as Chicago and Detroit . \u201c We need to respect the intent of the original donors , \u201d Jenkins said . Jenkins said it is natural that the donors chose the bluff as the location for the monument because it would get more exposure than the original site . White said Monday the bluff area can serve as an introduction into the city for tourists , which makes the location of the original marker appropriate . White said the bluff area contains a historical significance for African American , as well . White said black males used to congregate on the bluff in the early years of the depression to look for work . \u201c They used to assemble in that area hoping to get a job for that day , \u201d White said . White said the bluff was also the location of the Freedman 's Picnic after the end of the Civil War . The picnic was a parade of freed slaves that started at the bluff in 1867 and paraded to the grounds of Longwood , which was the largest assembly of people in Natchez until 2005 when the Red Cross handed out money to Katrina victims , White said . White said former slaves who had fled Natchez came back for the picnic . Jenkins said moving the monument would also present potential public relations and logistic issues because the original site is private property . \u201c By sitting in the city park on the bluff , the monument anchors the tragedy as a very important component in the span of Natchez history that affected hundreds of families throughout the entire community , \u201d Jenkins said ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

This is n't really the case with Plattchen : Twist 'n ' Paint . True , the game lives up to its sub-title , as you will be twisting with the Wii-mote or nunchuk , and you do inevitably \" paint \" in a sense , but the game is far from regular in about every single way . Everything from it 's insane ( and yes , at times very unintuitive ) interface , its story \u2013 focused around Earth , seven billion years from now , when life has evolved into gears \u2026 yeah , like car gears \u2013 and lack of any real direction or helpful tutorial is simply odd . Chisel away at its rougher , stranger aspects though , and you 'll find a pretty entertaining , brain - bending puzzler for WiiWare . It 's not the best on the download service by any means , but if you 're looking to take a chance on a game you simply wo n't find on any other platform , Plattchen is an interesting 1,000 point investment . For starters though , I need to make mention of the interface . Laid out in a grid system ( much like a chess board , really ) , all of the modes and options are placed as colored tiles with no real explanation as to what you 're selecting , or why . After a few point- and - clicks through the confusing setup though , you 'll find that there 's a grid based on what mode , skill level , and unlocked level you 're selecting , with other random modes and options across the bottom to fill in the gaps . All screen-to - screen movement is done with clicking initially , but scrolling through pages ( such as a tutorial , or high score boards ) is done by moving the cursor off-screen in that direction . If you want to arrow right , for example , you wo n't click on the on-screen arrow ; you 'll actually drag your cursor and exit the screen off to the right . It 's odd , and that 's just one of dozens of strange choices made by the team , and some of them , such as the cursor dragging , actually feel kind of rewarding after a few repetitions . Everything from cursor avatars ( little space men or butterflies that act as save files , and also follow your cursor around the screen as you play ) to the random modes and control styles make Plattchen a curious little package . At times it can be fun , at others you wonder what the hell the team was smoking when they came up with the design . Closing Comments Plattchen is an odd game , pure and simple . The core mechanic is essentially a mash - up of gravity - based puzzle games , Bejeweled or Othello , IR pointer control , and rotation - based color selection , but with so many strange rules , modes , and options the game is both amazingly robust and also completely random at the same time . Some modes require players to saw back and forth with the Wii-mote to flip tiles \u2013 it does n't feel very good \u2013 the main twist - based mechanic is a great concept , but some gamers will be instantly turned off at how odd and somewhat uncomfortable hand positions need to be to play it right . Random aspects like shooter elements and a very unique , but also challenging , scoring system make this one a game that only adventurous players will drop 1,000 points for and try to get into , but like me , you may find yourself finding a pretty entertaining game and some great ( but strange ) concepts buried within this very unconventional WiiWare offering . Download at your own risk , but if you 're looking for something truly original , and do n't mind taking a gamble , Plattchen is certainly a one - of - a- kind offering . | Rating ||Description | | out of 10 | | click here for ratings guide | | 6.5 | | Presentation | A total grab - bad of poor font , interesting style , thrown in lighting effects and a bizarre overall design .

His grandfather , previously a wealthy man with ample property , went bankrupt due to the cursed habit . He saw how his friends ' fathers ignored the education and the wellbeing of their families . These memories made a vivid impression on the boy , and go a long way in explaining why today , Bali 's governor is not a keen supporter of gambling of any form . Later , when Pastika became Bali's Chief of Police , he all but eliminated the vice because of the social problems and untold misery it caused . It was during his tenure as Papuan 's police chief that Pastika helped solve the first Bali Bomb \u2013 the terrorist atrocity in Bali in October 2002 \u2013 which made him widely known all over the world . On an island whose economy is based on tourism , Pastika 's background as chief negotiator in the 2002 and 2005 Bali bombings has stood his political career in good stead . Of humble origins , I Made Mangku Pastika was born the son of a teacher in the small village of Sanggalangit in Buleleng Regency of north Bali in 1951 . After the devastating eruption of Gunung Agung in 1963 , the family 's struggles were so difficult that his father decided to join the government transmigration program in Bengkulu , south Sumatra , where he accepted a job as a school principal . Since the house was barely enough to accommodate the family , the young boy would sometimes sleep on one of the chairs in his father 's classroom . Pastika held many different jobs \u2013 cutting grass , selling ice cream and flowers , working as a handyman for a Chinese family \u2013 but his diligence paid off by graduating from senior high school in Palembang . One day , by pure chance , the young man accompanied a friend who wanted to enrol in the Indonesian police academy . When he learned that enrolment in the school was free of charge , it occurred to him to take up law enforcement work . He graduated from the academy in 1974 , beginning his long career as a police officer . Pastika began to distinguish himself from the start . While serving in Jakarta 's Tanjung Priok Harbour , several Chinese -speaking smugglers were driving a large cargo truck filled with electrical appliances to a warehouse . Pastika , who could speak Chinese , ordered the drivers to stop , thereby foiling a major smuggling attempt . Knowledge and experience that he later gathered in the police mobile brigade , in the criminal investigation unit and in Indonesia 's narcotics agency propelled his career forward . Pastika won an appointment as Chief of Police of East Nusa Tenggara ( NTT ) in 1999 at the time when the province was filled with refugees from East Timor . After serving in NTT , he was appointed Chief of the Papua Police Department . His first assignment was to investigate the murder of Theys Eluay , a respected local Papuan spokesman , which resulted in the conviction and sentencing of four Kopassus soldiers . When an opportunity arose to apply for a position as the police chief of his native province of Bali , Pastika was unable to qualify for the position . At the time he was a two -star general , and the post was open only to a one - star general . However , the post 's requirements were changed so that a two -star general qualified . After retiring from law enforcement as a three star general , Pastika became the first democratically elected governor of the island in 2009 . Previously , members of the upper Brahmana , Ksatriya and Wesya castes had governed the province . Pastika , who does not come from a privileged background , was the island 's first governor hailing from the peasant Sudra caste . As governor , he has always tried to close the gap between the people 's expectations and the government 's actual delivery . While the public is becoming better informed and action-oriented , the bureaucracy is stuck in their rules and regulations . He prefers to lead not by decree but by example . Not the sort of bureaucrat who goes home at 2 pm , he 's at his desk from 7:30 am to 5 pm . He 's actually on the job one way or the other seven days a week , working to change the mindset of the bureaucracy , encouraging Bali 's thousands of civil servants to be more disciplined and public service oriented and to adopt modern practices . He 's especially keen on developing what he calls \u201c e-government , \u201d computerizing government departments . A Man of the People After five years in the powerful position of Governor , Pastika has gained reputation as a straight - talking leader , a man who represents the needs and aspirations of the common man . A deeply religious man in a nation dominated by Muslims , Pastika is a big believer in harmony , solidarity and tolerance between the different inter-religious and inter-ethnic social groups . So involved is he with a lot of the poor that he has dedicated himself to poverty eradication . He has initiated grass root level programs to make housing more affordable and has repaired and upgraded 6,000 homes owned by poor Balinese . The Governor is in a large part responsible for Bali becoming the first province in Indonesia to have universal health care . Through efficient budgeting practices , he found a way to finance health care coverage for Bali 's residents . Prior to free heath care , maternal mortality rates for 2009 were 76 deaths per 100,000 births . In 2010 , under free health care , that figure dropped to 51 per 100,000 . Thousands of qualifying people have had eye cataracts removed so they can see clearly again , many for the first time . Pastika has also proven himself to be a friend of the environment . The banjar of Bali 's 1,473 traditional villages were recruited to protect the environment . There have been marked improvements on the disposal of Kuta 's copious amounts of rubbish brought in by the sea tides . Several waste disposal and recycling companies have started up during the Governor 's watch and department stores have been urged not to use plastic . Pastika has instituted programs to support organic farming and sustainable agriculture ( an organic garden surrounds his office in Renon ) . Some have gone so far as to call him \u201c visionary . \u201d He also put in place a mass transport bus system , SABAGITA , in the overcrowded Denpasar / Badung areas of south Bali . The popular no-nonsense governor and his re-election team hope that all of these accomplishments will be remembered by the electorate when he runs for a second five year term in Bali 's gubernatorial elections this May . Pastika has chosen Bali 's Golkar chairman and Badung vice regent , I Ketut Sudikerta , to campaign with him as his running mate for the position of deputy governor . Giant billboards with the gubernatorial and vice- gubernatorial candidates have begun appearing haphazardly all over the island . Early polls have already shown that the governor 's optimism is not unfounded . The \u201c Pastikerta \u201d ticket so far leads all other candidates ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

You are probably not alone , as of Jan. 1 , 2022 0:00 UTC on-premises Exchange servers seem to freezing transport of all emails \u2013 a date ca n't get converted . Here is a quick overview of what is going on . Advertising FIP - FS Scan Engine FIP -FS is probably the anti-malware virus scanner that has been on board since Exchange Server 2013 . This is supposed to scan the on-premises Exchange Server installation for malicious content . However , this anti-malware scan engine seems to cause problems more often . Back in October 2016 , Frank Z\u00c3\u00b6chling published the German blog post Exchange 2016 : FIPFS Event ID 6027 Filter Updates werden nicht runtergeladen , which pointed out numerous error possibilities when updating the signature files . ver\u00c3\u00b6ffentlicht , der auf zahlreiche Fehlerm\u00c3\u00b6glichkeiten beim Aktualisieren der Signaturdateien hinweist . And in early December 2021 , someone on serverfault.com posted the entry Exchange 2019 Antimalware engine updates download but do n't get applied . There , the FIP - FS MS Filtering Engine permanently generates entries in the Event Viewer because updates could not be installed . It has probably affected different Exchange versions and might be related to downloads of updates or virus signatures . There the error was probably corrected by Microsoft . FIP - FS error Ca n't Convert \" 2201010001 \" to long I was just alerted on Twitter by a follower to the following tweet , which briefly describes the problem , which has been occurring since January 1 , 2022 . Under Exchange , the Microsoft Scan Engine FIP -FS cannot be loaded . Instead , the error Ca n't Convert \" 2201010001 \" to long is reported . Seems that the new date is a challenge for Exchange . In follow - up tweets , another user reports with the name Joseph Roosen : Advertising Umm ya having issues with no mailflow because of this since that keeps crashing over and over since 0000 UTC . Dear we have a problem with hybrid since this service keeps crashing so basically mail is down . @MSFTExchange \u00c2 @ Microsoft\u00c2 @MSFT365 Status So it fits , the Exchange does n't let any mails through anymore . And via Facebook , someone pointed me to this tweet from Joseph Roosen , which puts it a bit in context : Just in time for the new year , the virus scanner on Exchange Server goes on strike and scares administrators . Since March 2021 , Microsoft has published the article The FIP - FS Scan Process failed initialization . Error : 0x80010105 AND Faulting application name : scanningprocess.exe , which refers to Exchange Server 2016 on Windows Server 2016 . There is the current entry from 1/1/2022 : The exchange server was stuck with this error : The FIP - FS \" Microsoft \" Scan Engine failed to load . PID : 39268 , Error Code : 0x80004005 .

Workaround : Disable Anti Malware Agent The affected person from the above tweet has meanwhile posted a very simple solution via Twitter . He has deactivated the anti-malware agent on the Exchange server . For this purpose there is the script Disable-AntiMalwareScanning.ps1 . Then malware scans are no longer executed \u2013 but the mails can be sent and delivered again . Someone else who is affected by this New Year 's surprise .

To slow the growth of advanced cancer after the initial treatment . This can help shrink the cancer , which is called a partial remission .

Is maintenance therapy new ? No , but doctors use it more today than in the past . Maintenance therapy is more common now for many types of cancer because : The number of effective drugs for most types of cancer has increased . Some of these drugs are not used for initial treatment , but they are effective as a part of maintenance therapy . New cancer drugs often have fewer side effects than older ones . This means that people may be able to take them longer . Maintenance therapy can help lengthen the lives of people with certain types of cancer . But some studies have shown that maintenance therapy does not work for all types of cancer . Some drugs are also more effective than others . Maintenance therapy often uses traditional chemotherapy drugs . However , it typically involves a single drug rather than a combination , so there are usually fewer side effects . But doctors give lower doses than when you first have treatment . You might also get targeted therapy , hormonal therapy , or other drugs . For example , doctors give hormones as maintenance therapy for some types of breast cancer . Maintenance therapy may include a drug from the first treatment plan .

For advanced cancer Maintenance therapy may help control advanced cancer that has improved but is not gone after initial treatments . In these situations , it can help people live longer . Maintenance therapy is now commonly used after initial treatment for several cancers , such as advanced lung cancer , colorectal cancer , and some types of lymphoma .

What are the potential benefits and risks of this treatment ? How often would I get it ? For how long ? Will my insurance pay for it ? When is watchful waiting a better option ? ( Doctors call watchful waiting \u201c active surveillance . \u201d It means watching for signs that cancer is coming back .

So why does Philip Ridley regard himself as a Young British Artist ? There are many Philip Ridleys . There is the children 's author , winner of a Smarties Book Prize and creator of well - loved characters such as Poppy Picklesticks . There is the playwright of the apocalypse , feted and reviled in equal measure , who so terrified the bourgeoisie with Mercury Fur ( 2005 ) that Faber and Faber refused to publish it and theatre - goers walked out nightly . There is the film - maker : author of the screenplay of The Krays , the mesmerising 1990 biopic starring the brothers Kemp , and director / writer of the cult classic The Reflecting Skin , with Viggo Mortensen in the lead . Then there is the St Martins - trained performance artist , photographer and painter . Philip Ridley is akin to a hologram : different every way you look at him . And the first thing this intimidating polymath says , when I meet him in his rehearsal space at the Pineapple Dance Studios ? \" Hello . I 'm Phil . Does n't it smell like the school gym in here ? Terrifying . \" We toddle off to a nearby caf\u00e9 . He is instantly likeable , warm yet vulnerable , with a big baseball cap rammed on as if for protection . He is \" thrilled \" about the project in hand : a revival of his 2000 play , Vincent River , at Trafalgar Studios , starring Lynda Bellingham and Mark Field . It 's a timely revival , he says , because , as a play that centres around a homophobic murder , it is more relevant now than when it first opened . \" You walk around the East End now and you see homophobic graffiti . You see some extremely enlightened graffiti , but you also see swastikas . Lots of them . There 's anti-gay fundamentalism coming from both Islam and the Catholic right . You hear rap lyrics openly calling for ' death to batty boys ' . Then you go along to the National Theatre to see Chatroom / Citizenship , a double bill for young people , and when two men kiss one another on stage , there 's a chorus of disgust from the audience . The teenagers make retching sounds . Honestly . It 's scary stuff . \" So is Vincent River a play about gay issues ? \" No more than Suddenly Last Summer is about gay issues . \" The first time it was performed , theatre critic Benedict Nightingale called it Ridley 's \" best play to date \" , but its social realism was largely written off . \" People were quick to say , ' This kind of homophobia does n't exist any more , we 're all liberals now . ' Well , that 's not my experience . Since the play premiered we 've had a killing on Clapham Common , we 've had a nail - bomb in Soho . We 've seen photographs of beautiful young men being hanged from a crane in Iran , surrounded by cheering crowds . What was their crime ? They were having a relationship . We 're beginning to realise that liberal culture is a thin veneer . \" Ah yes . Civilisation , to Ridley , is paper-thin . His canon of plays , from The Pitchfork Disney ( which opened starring Rupert Graves in 1992 ) to Leaves of Glass ( Ben Whishaw and Maxine Peake took the leads at the Soho Theatre in 2006 ) , are all set in a distinctive half - world where society is deteriorating and apocalypse is just around the corner . Before meeting Ridley , I had always thought they were composites of the barbaric past and a dystopian future . Now I see that , to him , they are set in the present . \" My plays are about now . Or tomorrow morning . Artists I really admire , such as JG Ballard and David Cronenberg , their take on society is always a beat ahead of where it 's going . Not that I would compare myself with them , of course \" ( one of Ridley 's vices is modesty ) \" but my plays to a certain extent have that . \" The Fastest Clock in the Universe , his 1992 surreal study of male vanity and homoeroticism , was originally derided as fantasy , but directly after , along came Marky Mark Wahlberg in his pants , the cult of Calvin Klein , and the rise of the metrosexual . It is to be hoped that the nightmare vision of Mercury Fur is not equally prophetic . This seems unlikely \u2013 its premise being a uniquely and precisely horrifying combination of elements including torture tourism , a boy wearing a golden suit , and \u2013 the scariest word in the English language \u2013 meathooks . But Ridley is quick to point out that a parallel scenario occurred soon after in Iraq . \" It was Mercury Fur re-enacted . All - American farm boys from Idaho , going to church on Sundays and eating apple pie , and all it took was 10 weeks without moral responsibility for them to be raping small girls and filming it on their mobiles , by all accounts . \" If there is a whiff of defensiveness about his retort , it is because he is still scarred from the furore surrounding its first showing . Mercury Fur was Ridley 's fifth play for adults , commissioned by Paines Plough and performed at the Menier Chocolate Factory in 2005 . A now-legendary production , it was directed by John Tiffany and starred Whishaw , both of whom have since gone on to greatness . The play is gut -wrenching yet never graphic : as in a Greek tragedy , its violence is largely reported . Its characters grapple with questions of love and decency . It has a moral core ; a sense of redemption , even . Yet the outraged response to the play overlooked all this . It was as if Ridley was being arraigned for his own vivid gift . \" People said , ' It 's sick \u2013 you see a child being tortured on stage . ' You did n't , but people seemed to think you did . \" Most punishingly , drama critic Charles Spencer said Ridley was \" turned on by his own sick fantasies \" . \" That personal attack just floored me , \" says Ridley . \" It 's horrible when all you 're trying to do is work , and you hope you have something to say about the world and the times in which we live , and then people just call you ' sick ' and ' pervert ' . As if we 're living in some Utopia and I 'm trying to spoil it for everyone . What I did in Mercury Fur , I did for a reason . I like putting people on a ghost train , but I guide them safely through the other end ; I do n't want to keep them there , I want to take them on a ritual of exorcism . \" ' Access unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30 - day free trial Sign up Did the public censure make him feel he had gone too far ? \" In the act of writing it never occurs to me that anything is shocking or not shocking . It would have been moral cowardice not to take it to the conclusion that the play was setting up . \" Worst of all , Ridley 's publisher , Faber and Faber , refused the play . \" I could n't believe I 'd been caught up in that controversy in this day and age . The first comment that the editor at Faber said to me was , \" I 've got to tell you that several people here are seriously offended by this . \" I have a thing about dialogue , so I remember . Those were her words . It was as if they 'd all suddenly turned into a bunch of Cardinal Wolseys , deciding what was right and wrong . It 's not their job to be moral arbiters ; it 's their job to publish . I think Faber realised they could n't say this , so after a few weeks they decided to rephrase it as , ' It 's a piece of writing that I do not admire . ' \" Ridley moved to Methuen , taking his back - catalogue with him . Mercury Fur has since been in constant demand , with productions both amateur and professional taking place across the world . It is now touring Australia . A gift for savage prophecy is often unwelcome in society , and Ridley has it in abundance . It seems to bubble up out of him . \" I constantly think a lot of my DNA is alien . I look at people and I hear them talking and I think , ' I do n't get what you 're saying , I do n't see the world like you see it . ' And then I come out with one word and they look at me as though I 've just said the most shocking disgraceful thing . But I 've grown up with that . My nickname at school was ' alien ' . \" Sitting there in the cosy caf\u00e9 in Covent Garden , Ridley launches into a speech that brings a real chill , casting runes for the future of East London . \" I firmly believe that we will see something terrible happen , \" he says . \" Fundamentalism is on the rise , whether it 's from Islam or the Catholic right . It 's ' We are right , you are wrong . ' It 's ' Women should not show their faces . ' It 's ' Men should not go out with men . ' It 's a pressure cooker and the lid is screwed on so tight that anger will just erupt in a terrible way . I firmly believe that there will be killings on our streets . \" Ridley is something of a recluse . He has lived in the same Bethnal Green tower block since he was born , and his flat is \" minuscule \" , a Peabody dwelling crammed with paperbacks , model dinosaurs , skulls and skins . \" You have to take this Bond -esque route to get past the door \u2013 there 's literally no room to move . I constantly moan to my mates about my lack of space . About three times a year I have these ' avalanches ' where about 20 shelves will fall down . \" To him , it is heaven to close the door and unplug the phone . \" You could lock me in there forever with pens and paper and I 'd be happy . As a child I remember watching films where people got life sentences in solitary confinement and I 'd think , ' How lovely . ' \" His mother worked on a supermarket checkout ; his father was a lorry driver . \" My world was between five streets . You could n't make a bowl of gravy without someone reaching out to dip a bit of bread in it . \" It would all come in useful , starting with his screenplay for The Krays . As a child , he was very sick with asthma . \" I did n't talk much , so I grew up listening a lot while at home off school . I was in an oxygen tent for a lot of the time and people tended to think it was soundproofed and talked very openly in front of me . \" He used to hide a tape recorder under his parents ' sofa in the living - room , tape them all night , then write up transcripts . Now he eavesdrops professionally , recording conversations on the bus in Bethnal Green ( he mimes holding a Dictaphone surreptitiously over his shoulder ) . He is a real poet of place ; all his plays are set in the East End . \" A dilapidated room above an abandoned factory in the East End of London \" is the set direction for The Fastest Clock in the Universe ; Vincent River is full of references to \" Vicky Park \" and Mare Street . Ridley transcribes local graffiti and photographs passers - by . \" Some of the biggest influences on Mercury Fur were the snaps I 'd taken of people out and about in fur coats looking very bling , and suddenly this gang started to form in my mind . \" Everything feeds into his work . \" I never know where the life stops and the work starts or vice versa . \" When mates come round and we have a cup of tea , I 'm always asking them to read little bits of speeches or taking photographs \u2013 my ' studio ' is literally four squares of black paper pinned on the wall next to the fridge \u2013 or asking them to try on outfits . Most of my mates are actors . \" Might these actors include Mortensen or Whishaw ? Or Jude Law , who starred in The Fastest Clock in the Universe ? \" I have n't seen Jude for a bit \" he laughs . \" But the other two are both mates . How blessed am I ? They 'll be round here and it 's on with the sunglasses or the silly hat . We might take 1,000 digital photos in an afternoon , and one of them will just have something special that I can use in a play . \" The visual and verbal clearly synthesise in Ridley 's head ; as an art-school contemporary of Damien Hirst and the Chapman brothers , he sees himself as a Sensation artist , working in a linguistic medium . It 's only because theatre critics ca n't think outside the amphitheatre that they have n't noticed . \" It 's the most obvious thing to me . \" And indeed , the insects that recur through his work , variously tortured and vomited up by his characters , the butterfly motif , the shock and scandal : the parallels are all there . \" A lot of the stuff they are dealing with I am dealing with . Birds , insects , crocodiles , dinosaurs , dolphins \u2013 there 's a menagerie that keeps coming back in my work . I do n't plan it that way . Work is a lot like dreaming ; it 's whatever the unconscious throws up . I love it when you write furiously at night and then the next morning you go back and read it and it 's like , ' Oh my God , that 's bloody good , I did n't realise I 'd done that . ' \" Ridley 's existence is geared towards work . \" I've never earned much ; I do n't have a mortgage and I do n't want one . Everything is set up so I can do the work I want to do , and I do n't have to write six episodes of EastEnders to pay the bills . \" He writes , he says , to understand the world . \" My work is not cerebral at all . Telling stories and making images is how I make sense of the world , which is a very confusing place for me . Relationships are very confusing , sex is incredibly confusing . Perhaps I 'm not meeting the right people . I open the window and demons fly in . I think what I do in my work is try to make the demons feel welcome . \" I 'm at my happiest when I 'm alone at the desk in my back room , where I 've stuck black paper up at all the windows and I write by one lamp at this desk . I 'm at my least lonely when I 'm in that cocoon of writing . \" And there we shall leave Philip Ridley , to conjure his dark and comforting visions . * ' Vincent River ' : Trafalgar Studios , London SW1 ( 0870 060 6632 , www.theambassadors. com ) , from Tues to 17 November .

The fax cover sheet has a brief note , \" Dan , a generic description of the process . \" The name of the sender , based at the CIA , has been obliterated . You can view the document here . The document provides a step-by-step manual for extraordinary renditions . The process starts with \" capture shock . \" The detainee is subject to a medical examination prior to his flight . During the flight , the detainee is securely shackled , and is deprived of sight and sound through the use of blindfolds , earmuffs and hoods . The detainee is \" in the complete control of Americans . \" The detainee is stripped naked and shaved . A \" series of photographs are taken of the HVD while nude . \" A medical officer and a psychologist play key roles in the process ( though their professional ethics rules would prohibit such conduct . ) All of these practices are carefully engineered to facilitate the interrogation process . Nudity , sleep deprivation and dietary manipulation are used as standard preparatory steps . It then details the standard \" corrective techniques : \" these are a series of physical assaults labeled with innocuous titles like insult slap , abdominal slap , facial hold and attention grasp . \" Coercive techniques \" used include : walling ( slamming a prisoner 's head against the wall , with some protective measures to avoid severe injuries ) , water dousing , the use of the stress position ( known to the inquisition as the strapado , to the Germans in World War II as Pfahlbinden ) , wall standing ( referred to by the NKVD and KGB as stoika ) and cramped confinement . Because of substantial redactions , it seems unlikely that this list is complete . None of this information is surprising . In fact it all tallies perfectly with the description of the renditions program that can be derived from the report prepared by the International Committee of the Red Cross , which used the appropriate legal designation for these techniques : \" torture . \" But this is an historical document , right ? President Barack Obama shut down the black sites and the extraordinary renditions program immediately after taking office , right ? Well , not entirely . Consider the recent rendition of a Lebanese businessman accused of petty contract fraud , Raymond Azar . The first stage of these guidelines was followed with precision . He was seized in Afghanistan by U.S. Justice Department operatives . They claim they had the approval of the Afghan government . The Afghan government disagrees , saying it has no record of ever having permitted the \" snatch \" of Azar . According to papers filed by his lawyers , Azar was presented with \" capture shock , \" stripped naked , subjected to a body cavity search for \" health reasons , \" was shackled , subjected to hypothermia and sleep deprivation , and then was transported in a Gulfstream with the requisite hood , blindfold and earmuffs . When pressed on this in court , the Justice Department claimed it was only following \" standard procedures . \" The CIA memo shows that this claim is accurate : it was following standard procedures for extraordinary renditions , which were approved in a series of now-rescinded memoranda prepared by the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel . The Justice Department also claimed , in papers filed with the court , that the extraordinary measures were taken out of concern for the safety and security of the prisoners and the government agents involved . But on this point , the Justice Department is now revealed as being guilty of what at a minimum would be called a \" failure of the duty of candor \" to the court . The 2004 CIA memo delivered to the Justice Department explaining these procedures makes very explicit that the techniques employed have little if anything to do with the safety and security of the personnel involved . They explain the real function these techniques : \" To persuade High - Value Detainees ( HVDs ) to provide threat information and terrorist intelligence in a timely manner , to allow the US Government to identify and disrupt terrorist plots . \" The preparatory measures , such as capture shock , nudity , body cavity search , sleep deprivation and manipulation of nutrition are designed to put the prisoner in a position in which he can be effectively interrogated . They are geared to breaking down psychological resistance and making the prisoner pliable . Not every technique designed to wear down resistance and make a prisoner more willing to talk is , of course , \" torture . \" But in fact these techniques are highly coercive and have been held to be torture . Moreover , in the Azar case , the Justice Department agents used these techniques in precisely this fashion , moving to aggressive interrogation immediately after applying the preparatory measures . Azar even claims that one agent brandished a photo of his family taken from his wallet and threatened that he would never see them again -- something Azar interpreted as a threat against the safety of his family . The credibility of this account is boosted by the release this week of a 2004 CIA inspector general 's report , which documented numerous cases in which similar threats were made . After Azar 's allegations of torture became public , Justice Department prosecutors rushed to snatch a plea bargain deal with Azar , clearly motivated by a desire to put an end to that issue . But whatever deal was struck with Azar should not let the government avoid the question of accountability for what was done in this case . That should start with an examination of the Justice Department 's failure to candidly disclose to the court that the rendition techniques they applied to Azar were part of an effort to coerce a confession were explicitly engineered for that purpose . In sentencing Azar , the court will have to start with the recognition that the Justice Department began , overstepping the lawful constraints on its authority , to mete out punishment to him from the moment they seized him in Kabul . But the broader question is for the new panel that the Obama White House has set up to oversee renditions and interrogations policy : Why are procedures designed to secure intelligence from violent terrorists being used on businessmen involved in petty contract fraud cases ?

With the score level at 1 - 1 entering extra time , the teams scored four minutes apart . Kei Kamara leapt to head home in the 98th minute , but Shalrie Joseph popped up to head home a free kick in the 102nd . Then in the fifth round of penalty kicks , Khano Smith stepped up with a chance to give the Revolution the crown . But Pat Onstad saved the effort . The next six shooters all converted until Ashe fired off the bar . Nate Jaqua opened the scoring after 18 minutes after Amaechi Igwe turned the ball over inside his own box . Steve Ralston tied the score four minutes before halftime with a volley from a Mauricio Castro cross . Eddie Robinson ( hamstring ) and Richard Mulrooney ( knee ) did not travel for the Dynamo . Geoff Cameron continued at center back beside Bobby Boswell in Robinson 's absence . Nate Jaqua and Brian Ching partnered up top once again after Jaqua set up Ching for a goal in Saturday 's 2 - 0 win against Columbus . Selection problems also hampered the home team , with Jay Heaps suspended and Michael Parkhurst away on Olympic duty . Amaechi Igwe partnered Jeff Larentowicz in the center of defense . Rookie Chris Tierney started at left back . The match started at breakneck pace with both teams seeking to attack the perceived weaknesses on defense . The Dynamo 's Wade Barrett had to come back quickly to hook a ball over his own end line from a cross through the box . Dwayne De Rosario hit the post after just four minutes after jinking through the Revolution defense and hooking his effort towards the near post . Joseph nearly responded on both ends . Joseph 's long - distance drive kept rising just over the bar , before he almost knocked the ball over the bar with his thigh . The cadence for a goal kept building as Mauricio Castro 's free kick just missed the upper left corner with Onstad stranded . But when the goal came , it came from the oddest of circumstances . Cameron lumped a free kick down the center of the field . No Dynamo player challenged and Reis looked likely to come out and collect it . Igwe decided to clear it with his back to the ball and shanked it right to Jaqua . The burly striker made no mistake to give the Dynamo the lead . It should have been two just a minute later from another Igwe giveaway let Jaqua slide a ball to Ching with space inside the area . Ching did n't make good contact with his strike , but managed to knock it off before the ball trickled away from danger . Steve Ralston tested Onstad at his near post with a free kick , but the Canadian international reacted smartly to push it around the post for a corner kick . Sainey Nyassi should have tested Onstad minutes latter after a quick buildup from left wing to right wing gave him space at the far post , but Nyassi managed to drive his effort off the side netting . The Revs were growing in confidence and generated a penalty shout in the 33rd minute . Nyassi jumped to meet a corner kick at the far post only to see Craig Waibel barge him in the back . Referee Howard Webb was n't impressed , much to the chagrin of the Revolution players . Houston responded quickly through De Rosario . A thumping shot forced Reis into an acrobatic save at the near post after the Revs could n't hack it clear . De Rosario then got in behind the defense moments later with another route one service . After rounding Reis , De Rosario slid a ball towards goal before Larentowicz recovered and cleared the goal - bound effort . Tierney 's turn to clear off the line came quickly afterwards after Reis came for a corner kick and could n't collect . Jaqua shot towards goal , but Tierney managed to keep it out and get it clear . Just when Houston looked to score the killer second , New England conjured up the equalizer . Castro 's right - footed cross found Ralston at the far post and the Revs captain smashed home his volley to equalize . Another defensive giveaway nearly put the Revs in front three minutes before the break . Bobby Boswell coughed it up on the edge of his penalty area . Kheli Dube surged into the penalty area and whacked his effort towards goal . Onstad charged out of his goal and diverted the ball out of harm 's way . The early stages of the second half did n't produce nearly the amount of chances as in the first half . The frantic pace settled down to merely a frenetic pace , one where both teams still tried to surge forward but did n't connect nearly as well . Half - chances ruled as Jaqua shanked wide after Ching played him in and substitute Khano Smith cut inside and drove towards Onstad . Extra time loomed , and Igwe ensured it would arrive after tackling Davis as he shaped to shoot in second - half stoppage time . Kamara headed the Dynamo in front in the 98th minute . Ching drove a curling ball into the box . Reis looked like he should have punched away , but did n't get to the ball in time . Kamara nodded into the vacated net to restore the Dynamo 's lead . That lead lasted just four minutes . Ralston lofted a free kick up towards the far post . Joseph wrestled away from Bobby Boswell and directed his header into the far side netting . That would be enough to drive the match into penalties , and the crossbar emerged as New England 's hero after Ashe 's shot caromed away to give the Revs the SuperLiga crown .

In 1933 , the original movie was designed to beguile and distract a suffering US . President Roosevelt 's programmes for rebooting the economy had yet to take effect , and the movie 's audience was desperate for the temporary relief of big - budget effects , big - name stars and the 200 \u201c gorgeous girls \u201d that the trailer promised . 42nd Street proved more popular than the Warner Brothers studio bosses had dared imagine but credit was given less to director Lloyd Bacon than to Busby Berkeley , the actor and self -trained choreographer in charge of its musical numbers . Warner Brothers were taking something of a punt on Berkeley , who had no formal dance training and whose first experience of choreography had been organising marching drills during the first world war . But Berkeley had displayed some talent for working with chorus lines on Broadway , and spent two years with the Samuel Goldwyn studio , choreographing a number of low-budget musicals . During that period he 'd begun playing with new ways to put dance on screen . 42nd Street gave him the budget and freedom to let those ideas fly . When we look at a number such as Young and Healthy today , its structural devices may seem tame but at the time they embodied a bold new attempt to liberate dance from the physical conventions of the stage , and place it in a purely cinematic dimension . By constructing the choreography around a trio of hydraulically operated platforms , Berkeley transformed the spatial possibilities of his choreography . He could move his dancers between different levels , without the need for complex lifts or partnerwork ( 0.24 ) ; he could create effective shifts in pattern and speed with only minimal physical activity ( 0.40 ) . Even more radical were the visual possibilities created by his agile camera , which ranged from this tracking closeup of the dancers ' legs ( 1.23 ) , abstracting them to a V-shaped tunnel of stockinged flesh , to the dizzying overhead shots that turned the chorus line into a kaleidoscope of art deco patterns . Berkeley 's overhead shot became his signature device ( it was significant perhaps that he 'd been an aerial observer with the US air corps ) ; and he made even more dramatic use of it during the second half of the movie 's title number , which dramatised the \u201c naughty , gawdy , bawdy , sporty \u201d life of 42nd Street . Berkeley starts out by choreographing vivid vignettes of individual characters : a juggling street vendor , a fighting couple , a drunk , a barber , a cocktail waiter . But as these individuals are re-absorbed into the ensemble , and as the crowd then morphs into a street of dancing buildings , the camera soars higher and higher , until the scene is abstracted into a dreaming cityscape . The box-office success of 42nd Street propelled Berkeley to the top of his profession . He choreographed six more musicals during the next two years and his ideas grew exponentially \u2013 and expensively \u2013 more flamboyant . The By a Waterfall number in Footlight Parade ( 1933 ) featured giant water tanks in which its chorus could float though a riot of pin-wheeling , molecular patterns . In Gold Diggers of 1933 and Dames , Berkeley elaborated his dance numbers with an ever more inventive panoply of costumes , props and multi-level platforms . Berkeley helped make the 1930s a golden age for the Hollywood musical and the above compilation of clips illustrates just how brilliantly his imagination was suited to the silver screen . During that decade , Berkeley had a major rival in Fred Astaire , who was working for RKO , and even a basic comparison of the two men 's choreography reveals the limits of Berkeley 's style . Step for step , his vocabulary rarely deviates from a series of rudimentary leg kicks , shuffles and taps and a few simple , decorative movements of the arms . Lacking the musical phrasing , the grace notes , the full - bodied impetus of Astaire 's dancing , Berkeley 's choreography is memorable principally for the spectacle he was able to create out of large numbers of bodies moving in unison . Berkeley also became increasingly dependent on the interventions of the camera , for tracking closeups , witty angles and bird 's- eye views that added texture and substance to his choreography . Astaire once quipped of his own film performances , \u201c either the camera dances or I do \u201d , and while most of his own on - screen dancing could work just as well on the stage , Berkeley 's numbers would have palled rapidly without their cinematic box of tricks . If Astaire focused on the pure dancing body , and Berkeley on special effects , the other crucial difference between the two lay in their handling of sex . Back in 1930 , a strict code of censorship had been laid out for Hollywood and Astaire 's musicals , although swooningly glamorous , were chastely compliant . Berkeley 's early productions for Warner Bros , however , came with a strong subtext of erotic titillation . In 42nd Street 's Young and Healthy , the lingering pace of the camera as it travels between the women 's legs has the intensity of a voyeur 's gaze . More blatant still is the way the camera hovers over the dancers ' torsos in the By a Waterfall routine from Footlight Parade , revelling in the illusion of naked flesh created by the women 's clinging costumes . Berkeley offered his female actors and dancers up to the camera with a mathematical exactness that could border on ruthlessness . One of his signature tricks was to zoom , in rapid succession , over the faces of the chorus line , but far from individualising the women it simply confirmed their conformity to type ( usually blond and china - doll cute ) . As a device it was no more humanising than Berkeley 's favoured shots of disembodied legs , busts , feet or arms . Of course we look at old movies now with politically correct hindsight , but some among his original audience would have been made a little queasy by the sexual innuendo of Pettin ' in the Park , a choreographed guide book to the rules of seduction that featured in Gold Diggers of 1933 . Berkeley introduces a small boy ( Billy Barty ) into his cast \u2013 dressed up as a rollerskating baby and leading a chorus of policeman a frantic dance ; then chasing a football up the skirt of a beautiful woman , who lies on the grass with her stockings and suspenders in full view ; and finally leering suggestively to camera as he lifts up a window blind to reveal a chorus of women in visible states of undress . Berkeley always claimed there was nothing to read into his dances beyond his own ambition to make each better than the last . He resisted attempts to interpret his mass ensembles as an embodiment of Roosevelt 's New Deal collective spirit ; he shrugged off comparisons between his precision - tooled chorus lines and the monumental street parades beloved of Mussolini , Hitler and Stalin . However , one of the most powerful numbers he ever directed \u2013 Remember My Forgotten Man \u2013 was also the most political , as Berkeley drew on his wartime experiences to choreograph the heroism and suffering of his fellow veterans . In movement terms it could hardly have been more basic \u2013 little more than a marching column of men that Berkeley filmed against a succession of ironic backdrops ; a cheering , patriotic crowd , a rain - soaked battlefield , a postwar soup kitchen and a dole queue . But towards the end of the sequence ( around 5.40 ) he deployed all his cinematic knowhow to orchestrate an image that potently evoked the despair and the exaltation of the soldiers ' sacrifice : as lines of men tramp wearily across the screen they simultaneously look like victims of a military war machine and figures enshrined in a stained glass window . Berkeley 's brand of high - gloss musical gradually fell out of fashion and by the end of the 1930s he moved into straight directing . In the early 1970s , a revival of interest in the music , art and fashions of the 1930s restored movies such as 42nd Street to popularity . Berkeley 's influence is still felt in a whole range of choreographic creations . In Disney 's cartoon version of Beauty and the Beast , the Be Our Guest sequence pays a joyously overt homage , with its lines of dancing crockery and ditzy kaleidoscopic formations . The epic ensemble numbers in Riverdance are no less indebted to the choreographer in their machine - drilled , percussive unison . And the pure camp spectacle of synchronised swimming would surely have become a far lesser thing without the inspiration of Berkeley 's aquatically high - kicking chorus girls ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

The art of core making has its roots in circa 1300 BC , when sand casting was first developed in the form of clay molding . Since , then the crux of the process has remained the same , but the technical intricacies have evolved to match the requisites of the current era . But Core making was and still remains an integral part of the sand casting process . The process has evolved from crafting cores one at a time with skilled hands to production of thousands of cores with automated core shooters while moderating tolerances to as low as \u00b1 0.020 inches . In modern foundries , its amusing to even think of crafting cores with hand which will further be used for casting anything from centrifugal pump impellers to V8 engines . What are cores ? Cores are apparatus used to generate hollow cavities or internal features which cannot be formed using pattern alone in moulding , cores are majorly made using sand , but some processes also use permanent cores made of metal . In this article we will focus on sand core making process . The process of core making 1 . Selection of Core Sand Properties of core sand are highly crucial and are required to have characteristics like permeability , green strength , refractoriness , flowability , collapsibility , adhesiveness , cohesiveness , and fry strength . 2 . Mixing of sand with additives After an initial thorough mix of sand to ensure proper distribution of sand granules , binder is added to the silica sand with moisture content and other additives like coal dust , dextrin , or silica flour and together they create a mixture . This mixture should be uniform to create standardized sand cores with high production efficiency . 3 . Core Blowing or Shooting After the mixture is ready , next step includes blowing this flowable mixture into the core box , and depending on the type of process used , either the core box is heated , or the already heated sand mixture is blown into the core box and left to settle for a few seconds . This process is also referred to as core shooting process and modern foundries use dedicated core blowing / shooting machines for optimal production efficiency . 4 . Core Venting In the casting process , the core will be surrounded by molten metal which will stimulate gases inside the mold , and it is essential to provide a venting passage for these gases as if remain entrapped inside the mold , these gases can result in casting defects . Therefore , to obtain good permeability additional venting holes are made in the cores . 5 . Reinforcement of Cores Some cores , heavy & large cores in particular , might need additional reinforcement material like cast iron grids or low- carbon steel wires to maintain coherence . 6 . Baking of Cores Depending on the type of process used , baking of sand cores is done in convention oven with temperature between 200\u00b0 C to 250\u00b0 C ( 392\u00b0 F and 482\u00b0 F ) , the heat causes the binder to polymerize . 7 . Core Cleaning & Finishing After baking , cores are ready for cleaning & finishing . Following methods are used as per requirement : - Trimming of cores involve removing loose pieces and other unwanted projections - Brushing is used to remove loose sand off the core with fine wire brush - Coating is crucial step for finishing and involves coating of cores with refractory material to improve heat resistance . 8 . Core Inspection This step includes either manual or machine inspection of the cores for dimensional accuracy . 9 . Core assembling This includes assembling of multiple cores together with core glue in case of small and medium size cores and bolts in case of large cores . Feedback section 1 .

Some background on Maestre and her art : 1 . Jennifer Maestre has loved \" the way pencils smell and how the graphite gleams \" \u00c2 since she was a young girl . She never wanted to throw one away , sharpening them until they were just tiny nubs . To Maestre , pencils represent \" creativity , inspiration , striving , work potential , and fun , \" \u00c2 in addition to being \" cute . \" \u00c2 2 . To create her pencil sculptures , Maestre takes hundreds of pencils\u00e2which she buys by the gross\u00e2and cuts them into 1 - inch sections that she turns into beads by drilling holes through them . Then , she sharpens the pieces and sews them all together , usually using the peyote stitch , a sculptural beading technique . 3 . Sea urchins were the original inspiration for Maestre 's pencil sculptures . As she describes it , \" The spines of the urchin , so dangerous yet so beautiful , serve as an explicit warning against contact . The alluring texture of the spines draws the touch in spite of the possible consequences . \" \u00c2 She also draws inspiration from animals , plants , other art , Ernst Haeckel , Odilon Redon , and mythology . 4 . Maestre also creates jewelry from pencils by gluing together blocks of pencils , slicing them at varying angles , and then laminating the pieces . The resulting jewelry looks so unlike pencils that people often ca n't figure out what it 's made from . Maestre has said , \" Sometimes people ask me if I melt the pencils\u00e2which is a funny question , pencils are made of wood ! \" \u00c2 5 . Some of Maestre 's sculptures are comprised of 4,000 pencil stubs , sometimes even more . Though it 's hard for her to estimate just how many pencils she 's used in the 10 years or so she 's been creating pencil sculptures , Maestre guesses she 's used \" at least 5,000 pencils \" \u00c2\u00e2a number that includes only the pencils required for sculptures , and not for jewelry .

Today this essential grain can also be found in a variety of processed foods , some with histories centuries old . Rice 's role in Japanese cuisine is not limited to its appearance on the table , a steaming bowlful around which the meal is planned . It is also the main ingredient in a number of well - known foods , beverages and seasonings . The final product depends on how the rice is processed and on what type of rice is used , whether uruchimai , the ordinary rice that is served with meals , or mochigome , a glutinous rice , most often prepared for special occasions and used to make snacks and sweets . Sake , Mirin and Vinegar The most popular processed rice product is sake , a brewed , highly alcoholic beverage with a mild aroma and delicate blend of flavors . Fourth - century records reveal its essential role as a sacred offering to soothe the gods . Three ingredients go into sake brewing - rice , water and the fermenting agent koji ( steamed rice inoculated with the yeast Aspergillus oryzae ) . The fermented liquor is put into cloth sacks and pressed to separate the sake from the lees ( the remains of the rice and koji ) , then heated to kill bacteria - a technique invented in Japan some 450 years ago , long before the discovery of pasteurization . While wine fermented from grapes is regarded as an accompaniment to a meal - to accent or bring out the flavors of foods - in Japan , sake is accompanied by small portions of food , or sakana , to enhance the flavors of this celebrated beverage . In other words , it can be said that Japanese cuisine developed as an accompaniment to sake . Mirin is a sweet , alcoholic flavoring , also made of rice ; namely , distilled rice spirits mixed with steamed glutinous rice and koji , which is fermented . Originally drunk as a liqueur with a rather tart taste , mirin has been refined over the years , becoming one of the mainstays of Japanese cooking . Combined with soy sauce , for example , it forms the basis of teriyaki sauce , a popular basting sauce for grilled foods . Before sake is heated to kill bacteria , it quickly sours , because bacteria converts the alcohol to acetic acid when it comes in contact with air . The result is vinegar , another essential in the Japanese larder , which can also be made from sake lees . Miso , Pickles and Mochi Another important flavor in Japanese cooking is provided by miso , a fermented paste of beans , rice or barley . Rice miso , made only of rice and koji , comes in two types , salty and sweet . The rather sweet , white miso is characteristically used in Kyoto cuisine . Rice also plays a major role in pickling and sushi production , the origins of which can be found in the Nara period , when fish , wild boar or deer were salted and pressed , then placed between layers of cooked , salted rice and pressed under stones to ferment . The rice soured because of the bacteria that produces lactic acid during fermentation , increasing its capacity to preserve the layered foods . The type of sushi that developed from this process is called narezushi - the early incarnation of the more familiar nigirizushi , a strip of seafood atop a small fistful of vinegared rice . Pickles , or tsukemono , a traditional sidedish to a Japanese meal , are said to stimulate the appetite and enhance the flavor of cooked rice . One method of pickling utilizes sake lees , while yet another uses rice bran ( nuka ) , a by-product of the rice - polishing process . Nukazuke , or pickling in bran , has been around for about 800 years . One of the most versatile rice products , mochi , is made with glutinous rice , which is steamed rather than boiled , and placed in a large wooden mortar while still hot , then beaten with a large pestle . Flipped and sprinkled with water between plunges until it becomes a coherent mass with a smooth , elastic texture , the ball of rice is then flattened and cut into pieces or shaped into rounds . Kagamimochi , for example , is a traditional New Year 's decoration that serves both as the dwelling place of the god of the harvest and the offering to that god . Small mochi balls , endowed with similar significance , go into zoni , a soup made from the symbolic offerings of seafood , fowl and vegetables that decorate the kagamimochi . In the past , most families pounded mochi whenever there was a special event , but today it is available in supermarkets , prepackaged . Households who prefer to make their own often use automatic mochi-pounding machines instead of the traditional wooden mortar and pestle . Sweets , Snacks and Instant Foods Glutinous rice flour is used to make another kind of rice - ball confection with a mochi-like consistency : the sweets served in the tea ceremony , or wagashi . Stuffed with sweet bean paste , or anko , and shaped and colored to suggest seasonal flowers or fruits , these delicacies have become a minor art form . The felicitous combination of anko ( made from red beans boiled with sugar ) wrapped in mochi was discovered about 500 years ago . Mochi may be cut into small pieces of varying shapes and designs and dried , then grilled or deep - fried as snack foods , often with soy sauce as the basic flavoring . Today , the crispness of these mochi snacks make them increasingly more popular among young people than grilled senbei , or rice crackers . For travelers in the Nara and Heian periods ( 710 - 1185 ) , another glutinous rice product , hoshii , was a lifesaver . The rice was steamed and dried , rather than pounded into mochi . The resulting product kept well and served as trail food in an era without inns , much less drive - in restaurants . The traveler would simply add an equal amount of boiling water to the hoshii , wait ten minutes , and the rice was ready to eat - instant food from a millennium ago . From the classic bowl of gleaming white rice to ancient emergency rations , the Japanese have centuries of experience in making full use of their rice crop . Even the bran left when rice is polished is used down to the last husk - in pickling beds , for bleaching root vegetables and as a source of oil . In the wide range of foods based on rice , and in the sacred character of rice itself , this fundamental grain has become the cornerstone of the culinary culture of Japan .

Ferguson , Jr. To the University of Connecticut School of Business Graduate Learning Center and the SS&C Technologies Financial Accelerator , Hartford , Connecticut October 29 , 2004 Equilibrium Real Interest Rate : Theory and Application I want to thank the University of Connecticut for providing me this opportunity to comment on the important and challenging concept of the equilibrium real interest rate and its relevance to monetary policy . I will use this occasion to discuss the role that estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate can play in thinking about the desired degree of policy accommodation . Those views , I should add , are my own and are not necessarily shared by anyone else in the Federal Reserve System . I hope that at the end of this talk you will conclude , as I do , that while the concept of the equilibrium real rate is a useful aid in thinking about setting monetary policy , it is not measured and observed with such precision as to provide a practical guide to the appropriate stance of policy . Current Situation As the most recent statement of the Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) made clear , the U.S. economy appears to have moved out of the soft patch that characterized the second quarter . Supported by ongoing advances in productivity and the attendant increases in real incomes , household spending has picked up . Businesses , for their part , seem to have shaken off at least some of their hesitancy to spend , although the subdued pace of hiring may signal that they still retain a wary attitude toward making important commitments . But the strengthened balance sheets of the business sector , along with buoyant cash flow , should provide firms with the wherewithal to fund a healthy expansion of the capital stock in coming quarters . No doubt the recent run - up in energy prices poses some challenges , but the evidence indicates that , without some further material shock , aggregate demand is on a track consistent with sustained economic growth . That should gradually return the economy to full utilization of its resources , while inflation remains subdued . The FOMC was confident enough about its assessment of the vigor of spending to indicate in its most recent statement that it continues to believe that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured . That begs the question , of course , of how the Committee can be sure that policy is currently accommodative . I find it instructive to first consider how not to measure policy accommodation . In particular , the fact that the nominal federal funds rate remains quite low does not , by itself and without context , signal that policy is loose . After all , spending decisions should depend on real , not nominal , determinants , including the real federal funds rate , which is the nominal federal funds rate less prevailing inflation expectations . Although backward - looking measures of inflation -- such as the four- quarter growth in core personal consumption expenditure ( PCE ) prices - - imply that the FOMC 's cumulative 75 basis points of tightening so far this year has moved the real federal funds rate into positive territory for the first time in almost three years , that observation is not sufficient to calibrate the stance of policy . For example , the U.S. economy expanded at about the same average pace from 1981 to 1990 and from 1991 to 2000 . In the earlier period , however , the real short - term rate averaged 4 - 3/4 percent whereas in the more recent one the real rate was 2 percentage points lower . Clearly , prevailing conditions matter in determining the degree of policy accommodation . It is only against a backdrop of an economy that seems poised to maintain sustained and solid economic growth , even as the funds rate rises , that the FOMC can determine that current policy is accommodative . The Equilibrium Rate in Theory What is needed is a benchmark summarizing the economic circumstances -- including , among other variables , the underlying strength of aggregate demand , the level of aggregate wealth , and economic developments in our trading partners -- combining to shape the expansion of activity and the extent of pressures on inflation . One way of providing that benchmark is to consider what level of the real federal funds rate , if allowed to prevail for several years , would place economic activity at its potential and keep inflation low and stable . If the actual real rate is below that benchmark level , policy can be viewed as accommodative , in that if that stance were maintained , ultimately pressures on resources would build . If the actual real rate is kept above that benchmark level , policy would seem to be contractionary . This definition makes clear that the most relevant aid in policymaking is an intermediate - run measure , in that there may be forces at work in the shorter run that push spending away from potential output even if the real rate were pegged at this benchmark rate . It also makes clear that the concept involves a good amount of judgment -- indeed , the same judgment that goes into making any economic forecast -- about the determinants of spending , the trend of productivity , and the forces affecting inflation in the intermediate term . Economists famously cannot agree on much . In this case , we cannot even agree on the name of the benchmark concept that I have just described . The real interest rate consistent with the eventual full utilization of resources has been called the equilibrium real federal funds rate , the natural rate of interest , and the neutral real rate . I prefer the first name , the equilibrium real federal funds rate , because , by using the word \" equilibrium , \" it reminds us that it is a concept related to the clearing of markets . Even if economists settled on a name , however , we are not likely to agree on a single model to describe a system as richly complicated as the U.S. economy . Thus , there are as many ways of estimating the equilibrium real federal funds rate as there are different economic models . There is , however , one way of estimating the equilibrium real rate that I do not find especially convincing . Some economists derive point estimates of the equilibrium real rate by taking averages of the actual real rate over long periods of time . True , over a long - enough sample period , resource slack probably averages near zero , which suggests that the sample average of the real interest equals the equilibrium real rate . But decisions about the sample period -- whether to include low-real - rate stretches , such as the 1950s , or high - rate periods , such as the early 1980s -- have material bearing on the estimate . This indicates to me that there can be significant and persistent deviations in the equilibrium real rate from the observed long - run average measured over decades . The average interest rate that seems to have brought aggregate demand and aggregate supply into rough balance in the past may not be the same rate required in every conjunctural setting . Our inability to equate the long - run average interest rate to the equilibrium real interest rate that is relevant for setting policy is not surprising given the manner in which economic behavior , technology , and government policy can change over time . Put another way , an estimate derived from long - run observations may not be relevant for policy for two reasons . First , economic conditions during the policy - relevant period might differ from the average conditions during the observation period . Second , the economy changes in ways that tend to limit the relevance of historical observations for policymaking . That said , policymakers do strive to understand what the equilibrium real interest rate will be over the long run , but that is a forward - looking notion that depends on our sense of how the forces of productivity and thrift will evolve over time as measured in decades . An understanding of a likely long - run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful , even though the level is not directly observable , because it provides a general sense of the level that would , over that longer period , allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance , given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth . Such an understanding of the longer - term prospects for the real interest rate aids in identifying variations in the concept over the intermediate run that is relevant for setting monetary policy --a period of several years , when cyclical forces dominate . Critically , such deviations in the intermediate run can be especially important for policy choice . For example , an unusual hesitancy on the part of businesses to hire and spend emerged in 2001 after the collapse of equity prices and was subsequently reinforced by corporate - governance concerns ; this hesitancy could be thought of as pulling the equilibrium real federal funds rate down temporarily below its longer-run value . In addition , other forces may also have weighed on growth , making it appropriate to move the real funds rate below the intermediate - run equilibrium for a time . From that perspective , the FOMC 's reduction in the actual nominal federal funds rate over this period from the level of 6 - 1/2 percent that prevailed at the beginning of 2001 to the forty - five - year low of 1 percent by mid-2003 had three components : ( 1 ) A reduction to match the decline in inflation expectations so as to prevent the real funds rate from rising inappropriately , ( 2 ) an effort to chase a downwardly moving equilibrium real rate given the pressures on aggregate demand , and ( 3 ) an effort to bring the actual real rate below its apparently lowered equilibrium to provide sufficient stimulus to cope with transitory adverse factors and to speed the recovery in production and employment . So while the real federal funds rate ultimately was pushed below zero , the extent of policy accommodation was less exceptional , in that many estimates of the equilibrium real rate had also fallen significantly . This is a tangible recent example of the need both to judge how the equilibrium real interest rate that is relevant for policy might have changed from a perceived long - run level and to set policy against the background of such an understanding . Indeed , in my judgment , the lingering hesitancy of businesses to make commitments , the restraint imposed on domestic consumers from an increase in the cost of energy , and the drag on domestic production from the excess of imports over exports all represent forces pulling the equilibrium real federal funds rate below its perceived longer-term level . And , in the context of well - contained inflation , the evidence of remaining underused resources gives us a good reason to hold the real rate below even the intermediate - run notion of its equilibrium to allow the economy to be firmly set on a path that will shrink the pool of these underused resources over a reasonable period . But as the expansion regains its footing and resource slack is worked down , we should expect both that the equilibrium real rate will move toward its longer- run level and that policymakers will no longer find it appropriate to keep the actual rate below its equilibrium . That is , the FOMC will likely be removing its policy accommodation over time . The Pace of Return to Equilibrium I have thus far argued that the equilibrium rate that is relevant for actual policy determination can only be judged in the context of forces influencing economic developments . Several aspects of the current outlook lead me to suspect that the return of the equilibrium real rate from its currently somewhat depressed level to its long - run value might plausibly be expected to be gradual and attenuated compared with historical experience . Let me highlight just three of these aspects . I have already mentioned the role of business hesitancy in determining the past trajectory of monetary policy . Clearly , if evidence of that hesitancy remains -- for example , if the labor market were to remain sluggish -- that might be one indication that the return of the equilibrium rate to its longer - run level is likely to be relatively gradual . Secondly , the household saving rate has fallen to less than 1 percent , quite low in its range of historical variation . If households , on net , take steps to return the saving rate closer to the middle of that range ( which , I might add , would provide welcome support to capital accumulation ) , then a sustained period in which consumption grows more slowly than income would result . Third , given government budgetary trends , some fiscal restraint is in order , and one might expect that those responsible for fiscal policy will move that policy to a more - balanced position ( another development I would welcome ) , thereby removing some fiscal impetus . I believe that the combined force of these three factors restraining aggregate demand , plus others that I have not mentioned , would require a lower real rate than otherwise to avoid economic slack . Let me add , however , that there is a powerful force tending to make the equilibrium real rate higher than it would otherwise be . The rapid expansion of labor productivity has raised the growth of economic potential , increased permanent income and wealth , and created an important inducement to add to the capital stock . All else equal , a higher growth rate of productivity will be associated with a more elevated equilibrium real rate . As long as productivity grows steadily at its recent pace , however , there is no reason to suspect that it will produce a change in the equilibrium real rate . In addition , the factors that I mentioned above might not unfold as hypothesized . Business hesitancy might lift abruptly and would be evidenced by large increases in business demand for capital and labor resources ; households might maintain a very low savings rate ; and government policy might not return quickly to a more-balanced posture . Any of these factors might imply that the equilibrium rate relevant for policy returns more quickly to , or even moves above , its long - run level as fewer forces weigh on aggregate demand . Recognizing the uncertainty regarding these various forces and the interplay among them , I believe it important that the FOMC calibrate the return of policy to the equilibrium real rate so that the process is neither hasty nor overly attenuated . Clearly , incoming data and the implications for the outlook should play a particularly important role in policy determination at this juncture . However , theory and practice both indicate that policy works with long and variable lags . Therefore , the actual stance of policy will have to approximate more closely the equilibrium real rate before the pool of underutilized resources is fully exhausted . Otherwise , we risk a buildup of inflationary pressures . Clearly the execution of policy will require careful evaluation as the FOMC attempts to judge both the equilibrium rate that is relevant and the pace of removal of accommodation that is appropriate . Estimating the Equilibrium Rate in Practice So much for the generality of theory . Economists have taken a variety of tacks to arrive at measures of the equilibrium real federal funds rate . I will touch on two techniques in particular . The first can be thought of as a mechanical attempt to implement my definition -- the level of the real federal funds rate that , if allowed to prevail for a couple of years , would place economic activity at its potential -- in models of the U.S. economy . For instance , we can use the many equations of a large - scale macroeconomic representation of the U.S. economy , such as the Federal Reserve Board 's staff model , FRB / US , to calculate at any point in time the level of the real rate that would eliminate economic slack in a reasonable period of time . Or we can rely on a reduced - form description of the economy that measures the output gap in terms of the actual real short rate . The value of the real rate that will move that gap to zero can be thought of as the equilibrium real rate . Besides the assumptions undergirding the construction of either model , such a calculation will require judgment in determining what is a \" reasonable \" period of time and how to cope with the run of prediction errors that are inevitable when trying to explain economic data . An attempt to employ a large model to calculate the equilibrium nominal federal funds rate can be found in an article by Antulio Bomfim . 1 Using the MPS model , the predecessor to the Board staff 's current model , Bomfim found that the equilibrium nominal funds rate varied in a range from 2 percent to 14 percent over the period from 1965 to 1994 , implying that his estimate of the equilibrium real rate turned negative at times . Laubach and Williams opted for the single - equation approach and estimated that the equilibrium real funds rate was around 3 percent in mid-2002 but that it varied from as low as 1 percent in the early 1990s to as high as 5 percent in the late 1960s . 2 In addition to exhibiting large swings , the Laubach - Williams point estimate of the equilibrium rate is a very uncertain statistic . The confidence interval around the estimate is such that there was a 70 percent probability that the actual value of the equilibrium real rate was between 0.5 percent and 5.5 percent . Clearly , this estimate is not measured sufficiently precisely to be a useful guide to policy . An alternative approach turns to financial markets to infer the market 's assessment of the longer - term prospects for real interest rates . Since 1997 , the U.S. Treasury has been issuing price- index - linked securities providing an assured real return . With about $ 250 billion of these inflation - protected securities now outstanding , we can get readings along the entire maturity structure of real interest rates . Currently , for instance , real short yields are close to zero , and longer - term rates are at about 1 - 5/8 percent . One could presume that the forward real rate of interest implied by yields on longer- term indexed debt -- or the real return provided , say , over the period five to ten years from now -- conveys a sense of market participants ' view of the long - run equilibrium real interest rate . 3 Unfortunately for such an inference , however , longer - term yields embody expectations of future interest rates , a term premium , and potentially a premium for the relative illiquidity of these instruments , so this technique will provide an overestimate of the equilibrium real rate . Conclusion This brief discussion highlights the uncertainties attending any attempt to measure the equilibrium real rate . I find these measures useful teaching tools to describe the complicated and iterative process of forecasting the path of the economy so as to arrive at the appropriate stance of policy . However , I believe it to be very important that the FOMC not go on a forced march to some point estimate of the equilibrium real federal funds rate . In my judgment , we should remove the current degree of accommodation at a pace that is importantly determined by incoming data and a changed outlook . Our knowledge of the workings of the economy is sufficiently imprecise that we could not attach much confidence to any single calculation that one might make of the equilibrium rate . Moreover , history provides a daunting record of challenges to economic forecasting associated with changes in economic behavior , the evolution of technology , and swings in governmental policy that would suggest that the equilibrium can vary over time . In such circumstances , the performance of the economy will provide feedback to assess the level of the equilibrium real federal funds rate over time . Footnotes 1 .

When Nike , Adidas , Puma and the rest grudgingly came round , it was hailed as a turning - point in the relationship of these companies to their sub-contractors in the developing world . Five years ago this newspaper spoke of \" the ethical revolution sweeping through the world 's sweatshops \" . It seems we spoke too soon : what was really under way was a revolution in these companies ' public relations departments . As our investigation published today reveals , conditions in hundreds of the factories in which the West 's favourite sportswear brands are manufactured remain highly unsatisfactory or appalling . None of the companies has committed to paying overseas workers a living wage , the paltry sum required for a worker to keep himself and his family in conditions of the most rudimentary decency . Many workers do not even make the derisory local minimum wage , which in China amounts to only two -thirds of a living wage . Some factories continue to use bonded , indentured , prison or child labour . Women working in others are subjected to compulsory pregnancy tests ; if they prove positive , they are summarily sacked . Supervisors terrorise workers into submission . These are the shocking facts revealed by a detailed examination of the reports submitted by the companies themselves \u2013 but as Puma breezily admits , the truth is certainly far worse than that , because some of the sub-contractors lie systematically about their employees ' conditions of labour , and in particular about the amount of overtime they work . Special software has been developed to falsify the records of working hours . The contrast these findings make with the codes of conduct the firms have embraced is startling . \" Our vision is for everyone in our supply chain to share a common set of values \" , declares Adidas . Nike 's code of conduct proposes that \" high ethics means success \" . It exhorts its workers \" to lead balanced personal and professional lives \" , and insists that \" Nike will strive to pay fair compensation \" . In the context of the gruesome shopfloor reality , these fine words are contemptible . Instead of trying to dazzle Western consumers with meaningless rhetoric , these firms must divert some of their vast financial muscle into bringing real improvements to the misery of the sweatshops .

They ransacked the main chamber of the Legislative Council - known in Hong Kong as LegCo - in what Chief Executive Carrie Lam called an \" extreme use of violence \" . The group were a small branch of a largely leaderless protest movement sparked by a controversial , now suspended , extradition bill . The protesters were evicted after a few hours , but the graffiti they left behind tells us a lot about the evolving nature of these protests . The defacing of the emblem Hong Kong is a semi-autonomous part of China , and LegCo is where its government sits and bills are debated and passed . Central on the main wall of the chamber is the territory 's emblem . In English , it says Hong Kong , but in Chinese it reads : \" The Regional Emblem of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People 's Republic of China \" . The protesters defaced a portion of the emblem bearing the word \" China \" , leaving the Hong Kong part of the emblem untouched . Under the Basic Law , in place since Hong Kong was handed back to China by the UK in 1997 , Hong Kong is guaranteed a level of autonomy and has freedoms not available in mainland China . It keeps its own judicial independence , its own legislature and economic system . But critics say this is under threat from an increasingly assertive China . The extradition bill , that would have enabled suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to China , was cited as proof of this , sparking massive protests . The bill has been suspended - and is unlikely ever to pass . But the defacing of the bill is indicative of the anger many in Hong Kong have towards China . The colonial flag The protesters also draped a colonial - era Hong Kong flag on the podium inside LegCo . It 's a sign of Hong Kong 's history as a British colony and is being seen as a message to the former colonisers , calling on the UK to hold China to account . One Hong Kong journalist said the flag was not a sign , as some have suggested , that the protesters want a return to British rule . \" Whatever the British Hong Kong flag means today , Beijing would n't be pleased to see it . And that might have been the point of putting it in front of the world 's cameras , \" said Inkstone editor Alan Wong on Twitter . Tyranny banner This black banner which was installed over the podium reads : \" There are no rioters , only a tyranny . \" The Hong Kong government described violent clashes on 12 June between protesters and police as a riot - something else that has angered the demonstrators . The term rioting is a serious one , it 's an offence punishable by up to 10 years in jail . Protesters want the government to drop this term . The sunflower movement The phrase \" Hong Kong 's sunflower \" can also be seen on the walls . It 's a reference to the Sunflower Movement protests that took place in Taiwan in 2014 when a controversial trade agreement led students and activists to occupy Taiwan 's parliament . They were protesting against what they said was a sign of Beijing 's growing influence over Taiwan - the same thing they say is happening in Hong Kong right now . ' Dog officers ' References to the police being \" dogs \" were sprayed repeatedly on these glass doors and elsewhere . Protesters have frequently described the city 's police force as \" lapdogs \" of the government , occasionally of Beijing too . It was 12 June that proved to be a turning point in the relationship between the police and the people . It first started out as another protest , but protesters and police officers soon clashed on the streets . Protesters were seen throwing items at police , who responded by spraying tear gas and firing rubber bullets . Footage has been circulating showing some officers dragging protesters and beating them with batons . Human Rights Watch called it a \" well - documented use of excessive force against peaceful protesters \" . Protesters have been demanding an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality . But there have also been large demonstrations in support of the Hong Kong police . The police commissioner has rejected allegations of excessive force , saying many police officers have been injured in the unrest . ' It was you who taught me ' A slogan sprayed on one of the columns in the Legislative Council reads : \" It was you who taught me peaceful marches did not work . \" It appears to be directed at Hong Kong 's leader Carrie Lam , who despite protests of up to a million people prior to 12 June , had remained adamant that the extradition bill would not be suspended . The government later backed down and suspended the bill , and Ms Lam indicated that it would likely not pass . However the bill has been perceived as being part of a wider agenda that aims to move Hong Kong further down a path of becoming a fully \" Chinese city \" , without its unique freedoms . ' Freedom ' The Chinese characters for \" freedom \" - sprayed on this screen in LegCo - sum up why people in Hong Kong say they are protesting . Under a deal struck with Britain that saw Hong Kong return to China in 1997 , the city was guaranteed to enjoy \" a high degree of autonomy , except in foreign and defence affairs \" for 50 years . The Basic Law ends in 2047 , and what happens to Hong Kong 's autonomy after that is unclear , which is fuelling the protesters ' sense of urgency ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Born on 1932 Allan Fakir ( 1932\u20132000 ) , a Pakistani folk singer is a one of the foremost exponents of sufi music in Pakistan . He is particularly known for his ecstatic style of performance marked with extreme devotional rhetoric and sufi dance singing . His peculiarly funny body language and distinctively pleasing facial expressions marked with a broad smile , were always amusing for his audience at live performances . Allan Fakir was born in 1932 in the ancient village of Aamari in Jamshoro District , taluka Manjhand , Sindh . His mother died soon after his birth . He spent his childhood in Manjhand , a town between Sehwan and Hyderabad . He belongs to the Mangrasi tribe the Mangarhars are believed to bring happiness and welcomed on festive occasions for their gift of melody . According to the traditions of this caste , Allan Fakir 's father used to beat the drum and sing traditional songs at weddings and Faqir 's brothers still do the same job . Fakir is an Arabic word , and implies a Sufi or a mystic . Thus in the real sense of the word , a Fakir is a person , who leads an independent life marked by piety , abstinence from material needs , and contentment in the available resources . It must not be confused with the rather loose usage of the same word implying a begger , in the local languages Urdu , and Sindhi . When he was only a teenager , Allan Fakir developed a habit of singing melancholy songs which his father did not like . Deprived of a mother 's love , he went off in search of someone who could replace that love . He arrived at the tomb of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai in Bhit Shah and started living there . Faqir 's memory was sharp even though he could not read and write . Hearing the traditional Latifi Raag sung every night touched his heart . Encouraged by Faqir Zawar Qurban Ali Lanjwani and Moolchand Maharaj , he began singing Bhitai 's poetry at the shrine and ultimately spent twenty years there until meeting Mumtaz Mirza , who introduced him to Radio Pakistan and ptv in Hyderabad and helped him to learn the correct pronunciation of Bhitai 's poetry . Eventually , he became a performing legend . His songs , mostly in Sindhi language except a few in Urdu , usually revolve around sufism and the devotional philosophy . But the characteristic which distinguishes him from many other folk singers is the depth of his feelings , which is very expressive in all his songs . One of his famous songs is a duet with Muhammad Ali Shehki , \" Allah Allah kar bhaiya \" which was a big hit and increased his popularity tremendously . A patriotic song \" Itne bare jeewan saagar main \" also got very popular . In appreciation of his services to folk culture , he was given a job and a small house at the Institute of Sindhology . He was originally appointed as an officer to help promote Sindhi culture , but due to his illiteracy , he was eventually demoted to the post of peon . Allan Fakir received the President 's Pride of Performance award in 1980 , the Shahbaz Award in 1987 , the Shah Latif Award in 1992 and Kandhkot Award in 1993 . Allan Fakir died on 4 July 2000 ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

He had previously helped his father and brothers reassert government control during a period of lawlessness and had served as a Minister . The young king took the title , ' Confident in God , Follower of the Firm Religion of Islam ' . Afghanistan 's monarchy had been established in 1919 . During the early years of his reign , power was actually exercised by his uncles , who ruled the country through the powerful office of Prime Minister . Throughout the Second World War and afterwards , the king helped steer the country on a path of neutrality . In 1953 his cousin Mohamed Daud became premier but Zahir Shah forced his resignation in 1963 , after which he began to assert his own power to the full . In 1964 he promulgated reforms which provided for a parliament , elections and a free press . Members of the royal family were also banned from holding public office . Parties were not strictly legal but tolerated . Social reforms included attempts to improve the status of women . Foreign aid flowed from both east and west but , apart from roads and irrigation projects , this help made little impact outside the Kabul area . Throughout his reign many potential advances and reforms were stymied through factionalism and constant political infighting . Zahir Shah himself was frequently accused of indecisiveness . However , his reign did see a long period of peace to which many Afghans now look back with nostalgia . During the early 1970s , however , Afghanistan was beset by drought and famine and the demands of Pashtun tribes along the border with Pakistan for autonomy .

However , civil and criminal trials have since determined that Juventus and Moggi did not enjoy such an advantage and that the punishments handed out in 2006 were based on incomplete evidence , and Moggi 's prison sentence was also written off last week following his appeal at the Court of Cassation .

You may have followed all the rules : no caffeine before bed , an early bedtime , and all the rest . But your best efforts are oftentimes for naught , foiled by the mysterious ways of sleep cycles . There may be an answer : WakeMate , a Y Combinator - funded startup that 's launching today , is looking to help you catch that ever-elusive good night 's sleep ( and maybe even the perfect nap , too ) . Wake Mate is one of the few startups we 've see that actually involves its own physical product ( another that comes to mind is FitBit ) . To use the service , you first order the WakeMate wristband from the website , which costs $ 50 . Then , you download an application for your Bluetooth - enabled smartphone ( WakeMate is launching with support for i Phone , BlackBerry , Android , Windows Mobile , and a standard Java app for non-smart phones ; support for Palm 's WebOS is on the way ) . Once you 've installed the app and paired your wristband with your phone , you set your alarm ( more on that later ) and hit they hay . The wristband tracks the movement of your wrist through the night , which it can use to analyze your sleep patterns . If you 're raising your eyebrows you 're not alone \u2013 this sounded strange to me at first , but co-founder Greg Nemeth explains it 's a well established sleep-study technique called actigraphy . The WakeMate wristband collects data throughout the night and stores it on internal Flash storage . When it 's time to wake you up WakeMate does n't necessarily sound an alarm at exactly the time you set . Instead , it monitors your sleep patterns for the 20 minute window prior to that and sounds your alarm when you 're in the lightest sleep mode , which can help eliminate that groggy feeling you sometimes wake up with . The alarm does n't come from the wristband though \u2013 instead , the wristband uses Bluetooth to trigger your cell phone 's alarm . It then transmits your sleep data to your phone , which in turn uses its cellular data connection to upload it to the WakeMate servers . You can then browse through your sleep history from the WakeMate website . Wake Mate will be facing off with a number of other sleep devices , including the Zeo Personal Sleep Coach , which was released over the summer . The Zeo consists of a standalone alarm clock that pairs with a headband that measures your brainwaves as opposed to your wrist movements . It 's also quite a bit more expensive than WakeMate , running around $ 250 . Nemeth says he says the Zeo as a powerful tool for people who need to diagnose their sleep problems . But he says that WakeMate has a much broader appeal , in part because of its lower price , but also because it 's more portable . For example , WakeMate can be used to help you take the ideal nap , even when you 're on the go . The device has modes for both ' power naps ' ( which last around 30 minutes ) and ' full naps ' , which range from 60 - 90 minutes . Wake Mate shows promise , but I do n't love the fact that it requires a Bluetooth handset to trigger its alarm . It seems like it would be easier just to integrate an alarm directly into the wristband , along with a cheap LED display so you can set the time ( you could still use Bluetooth to transfer your sleep data via a handset ) . Co-founder Arun Gupta says they 've considered this , but that integrating an alarm would make it bulkier , less comfortable , and more expensive . He also points out that some people might sleep with their arm under their pillow , which could muffle the alarm ( perhaps they could include a ' vibrate ' mode ) . All of that said , the sleep industry has a broad appeal \u2013 who has n't wished they could kiss those groggy mornings goodbye ? And the $ 50 pricepoint is low enough to make the product attractive even for people who do n't have serious sleep issues . You 'll have to wait a while to try one though : the site is now accepting preorders ( you get $ 5 off ) but the wristbands wo n't start shipping until January ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

If Union sea power did not win the war , it enabled the war to be won . When hostilities opened , the U.S. Navy numbered 90 warships , of which only 42 were in commission , and many of these were on foreign station . Fortunately for the Federals , Lincoln had , in the person of Gideon Welles , a wise secretary of the navy who was one of his most competent cabinet members . Welles was ably seconded by his assistant , Gustavus Vasa Fox . By the time of Lee 's surrender , Lincoln 's navy numbered 626 warships , of which 65 were ironclads . From a tiny force of nearly 9,000 seamen in 1861 , the Union navy increased by war 's end to about 59,000 sailors , whereas naval appropriations per year leaped from approximately $ 12 million to perhaps $ 123 million . The blockade of about 3,500 miles ( 5,600 km ) of Confederate coastline was a factor of incalculable value in the final defeat of the Davis government , although the blockade did not become truly effective before the end of 1863 . The Confederates , on the other hand , had to start from almost nothing in building a navy . That they did so well was largely because of untiring efforts by the capable secretary of the navy , Stephen Mallory . He dispatched agents to Europe to purchase warships , sought to refurbish captured or scuttled Federal vessels , and made every effort to arm and employ Southern - owned ships then in Confederate ports . Mallory 's only major omission was his delay in seeing the advantage of Confederate government control of blockade runners bringing in strategic supplies ; not until later in the war did the government begin closer supervision of blockade - running vessels . Eventually , the government commandeered space on all privately owned blockade runners and even built and operated some of its own late in the war . The naval side of the Civil War was a revolutionary one . In addition to their increasing use of steam power , the screw propeller , shell guns , and rifled ordnance , both sides built and employed ironclad warships . The notable clash on March 9 , 1862 , between the North 's Monitor and the South 's Virginia ( formerly the Merrimack ) was the first battle ever waged between ironclads . Also , the first sinking of a warship by a submarine occurred on February 17 , 1864 , when the Confederate submersible Hunley sank the blockader USS Housatonic . Daring Confederate sea raiders preyed upon Union commerce . Especially successful were the Sumter , commanded by Raphael Semmes , which captured 18 Northern merchantmen early in the war ; the Florida , captained by John Maffit , which in 1863 seized 37 Federal prizes in the North and South Atlantic ; and the Shenandoah , with James Waddell as skipper , which took 38 Union merchant ships , mostly in the Pacific . But the most famous of all the Confederate cruisers was the Alabama , commanded by Semmes , which captured 69 Federal ships in two years ; not until June 19 , 1864 , was the Alabama intercepted and sunk off Cherbourg , France , by the Federal warship Kearsarge , captained by John Winslow . A great many other Federal ships were captured , and marine insurance rates were driven to a prohibitive high by these Southern depredations . This led to a serious deterioration of the American merchant marine , the effects of which lasted into the 20th century . Besides fighting efficaciously with ironclads on the inland rivers , Lincoln 's navy played an important role in a series of coastal and amphibious operations , some in conjunction with the Federal army . As early as November 7 , 1861 , a Federal flotilla under Samuel Francis du Pont seized Port Royal , South Carolina , and another squadron under Louis M. Goldsborough assisted Burnside 's army in capturing Roanoke Island and New Bern on the North Carolina littoral in February \u2013 March 1862 . One month later , Savannah , Georgia , was closed to Confederate blockade runners when the Federal navy reduced Fort Pulaski guarding the city ; and on April 25 David Farragut , running the forts near the mouth of the Mississippi , took New Orleans , which was subsequently occupied by Benjamin F. Butler 's army . But in April 1863 and again in July and August , Federal warships were repelled at Fort Sumter when they descended upon Charleston , and a Federal army under Quincy A. Gillmore fared little better when it tried to assist . Farragut had better luck , however , when he rendered Mobile , Alabama , useless by reducing Fort Morgan and destroying several defending Confederate ships on August 5 , 1864 , in the hardest - fought naval action of the war . The Confederacy 's last open Atlantic port , Wilmington , North Carolina , successfully withstood a Federal naval attack by Porter on defending Fort Fisher when Butler 's army failed to coordinate its attack properly in December 1864 , but it fell one month later to Porter and to an ably conducted army assault led by Alfred H. Terry . Only Galveston remained open to the Confederates in the last months of the war . In short , \u201c Uncle Sam 's web feet , \u201d as Lincoln termed the Union navy , played a decisive role in helping to defeat the Confederacy ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

As early as 1756 provision had been made for four maternity beds in the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh ( RIE ) , and in 1793 the General Lying - in Hospital had been opened at Park House . However it was not until 1879 that money collected to commemorate the contribution of Sir James Young Simpson to obstetrics , ended the numerous moves to makeshift hospitals which had been made over the preceeding forty years , and enabled the City to open a purpose - built maternity hospital where the poor could have their children under medical supervision . Initially the hospital consisted of two lying - in wards , a labour ward , dispensary , kitchens and administrative quarters , as well as quarters for the matron , two house surgeons and seven or eight nurses . In 1895 Lady Tweedale opened the Married Women 's Pavilion . This was the west wing originally proposed by the architects MacGibbon and Ross , but postponed in 1879 because of insufficient funds . Four visiting physicians with their assistants undertook in rotation a three month term of duty . Besides hospital deliveries , medical students or pupil midwives , supervised by hospital staff , attended home deliveries . These are recorded in the Out - Door case books . The 1886 Amendment to the Medical Act made midwifery a compulsory course in the medical curriculum , and in 1890 women students were admitted to the hospital for clinical instruction . The risk of infection was always present and in 1899 the hospital closed becuase of puerperal septicaemia . Later cases were transferred as quickly as possible to the City Hospital to prevent cross-infection , and in 1924 Dr Nasmyth donated a new labour ward allowing the separation of infected cases . By 1910 the hospital was dealing annually with 616 indoor and 1327 district cases , and the hospital authorities were faced increasingly with problems such as lack of operating facilities , unsatisfactory accomodation , inadequate sanitation and gross overcrowding . After World War I three main - door basement flats in Lauriston Park and two flats in Graham Street were acquired to try to meet the increasing demands on the hospital . Throughout the first quarter of the twentieth century advances were made in obstetrics , pathology and paediatrics . In 1901 a pre-maternity bed was instituted at the hospital . William Ballantyne took a particular interest in the physiology and pathology of pregnancy and James Haig Ferguson furthered the cause of preventative medicine by stressing the benefits of routine antenatal supervision . As a result of his efforts the first out - patient antenatal clinic in Britain was opened in 1915 and in 1926 a postnatal clinic was opened . The Central Midwives Board for England and Wales ( established in 1902 ) recognised the Simpson as a training centre for midwives wishing to practice north of the border . In 1915 the Central Midwives Board for Scotland was established and the following year the hospital was recognised by them . Two years after the Notification of Births ( Extension ) Act of 1915 , The Edinburgh Local Authority launched a maternity and child welfare scheme in conjunction with the hospital . Seven antenatal out - patient clinics were opened in Edinburgh with the main consultative centre at the Maternity Hospital , for which the Corporation paid the hospital \u00a3 200 . In 1919 the Local Authority , acting on the recommendation of a Royal Commission report of 1916 , arranged with the hospital the establishment of an antenatal out - patient and in - patient venereal diseases department . In 1925 the first assistant paediatrics physician was appointed . With maternal deaths in Scotland reaching a peak of 651 in 1931 , a concerted effort was made to combat eclampsia and to generally reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality . This objective was achieved largely through advances in therapeutics such as the advent of chemotherapy and antibiotics , the work of the national blood transfusion service , and improved anaesthetics . From as early as 1910 overtures had been made to the RIE to alleviate pressure on the Maternity Hospital . Subsequent attempts had also come to nothing until in 1926 a conclusion was reached with the purchase of George Watson 's School from the Merchant Company . An obstetrical unit of 150 beds was constructed and at the same time the Florence Nightingale Nurses ' Home was built to provide accomodation for the midwives and their pupils . On 1st March 1939 the old Simpson closed and the Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion , which was incorporated into the RIE , assumed responsibility for maternity services . In the new Pavilion the principle of isolation as a means of containing infection was fully implemented and by 1979 the number of beds had increased to 225 while the hazards of childbirth and perinatal mortality had been drastically reduced . From 1939 to 1948 the hospital was administered by the Managers of the RIE ; from 1948 to 1974 it formed part of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and Associated Hospitals group ; from 1974 to 1984 the hospital was part of the South Lothian District of Lothian Health Board . From then on the hospital formed part of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh NHS Trust , now Lothian University Hospitals NHS Trust .

This season has been a belter , so we ca n't wait to find out what happens next . To celebrate the show 's return , we called up the lovely John Noble - who plays Walter ( and Walternate ! ) - to have a little chat . Read on to find out what he had to say about those flashbacks , Peter and Walter , and whether he thinks the show will be renewed ... How has it been playing both Walter and Walternate this season ? \" It 's been gift , really . I mean , Walter himself is a wonderful character to play , but then to be given this other [ role as well ] ... He 's a version of Walter , but one very much in the terms of the Fringe mythology - ' what would happen if ' stuff . So what would happen if you had a son stolen instead of having stolen one ? So it 's been based on the same characters but taking off in different directions . I 've loved it . \" Do you sympathise with one Walter more than the other ? \" In a sense , intellectually I do n't , because obviously this Walter on our side , he 's a loveable old character but in fact he did do what he did . He did take into his own hands this thing of crossing over and taking the son , albeit for good intentions , to save the kid 's life . You kind of sympathise with that and then you see he 's gone through hell ever since . Walternate on the other hand was a man who had his son stolen , and I can totally understand how that would twist the mind and turn him into a vengeful and very powerful character . So I kind of understand both of them . \" Do you like the fact that both Walter and Walternate have good and bad sides ? \" Oh , absolutely . At the time we introduced Walternate , I said to the writers , ' Please , please do n't make him a two -dimensional baddie . Down the track , give us something to humanise him ' . I was really insistent on that . As time 's gone by they 've started to give aspects of Walternate that say , ' Oh yeah , I understand now why he did what he did ' , and I really requested that to happen . Two -dimensional characters are fairly forgettable . \" Have you enjoyed playing a younger Walter in the flashback episodes ? \" I have ! It 's been great fun . It 's quite a shock , really . I think the most interesting part is finding the energy of the younger man as opposed to what we see in Walter and Walternate . And the passion that they have , which gets tempered a little bit with age . It 's interesting walking around looking at yourself 20 years younger with all that strange hair . It 's really cool , but my wife says she likes me better as I am ! \" Does it take a long time to prepare for the flashbacks ? \" Yeah , it does . Our makeup lady , particularly for the second flashback , worked out some terrific techniques to get the skin softer so it loses the wrinkles and so forth . This year we 've come up with some terrific technology . And [ I have ] a beautiful handmade wig which at that stage was the right length - should we go on further we 'd need to trim it back . We 've looked at it really carefully . As we become more efficient it 's generally about three or four hours in makeup . \" Walter can be quite quirky and eccentric - how much of that is in the script and how much is it your performance ? \" It 's a combination , because obviously I 've brought what I bring to it . They wrote the initial stuff and then I played with it , and as I played they wrote to it . So it 's been a dual effort . The more that I was prepared to do , the more that they would write . I 've never said no to anything so if they said , ' Walk naked along a tightrope ' , I 'd say , ' OK , whatever ! ' At this stage Walter continues to do outrageous things and as long as they keep writing them I ca n't think of anything I would n't do . \" Are you pleased with how Walter and Peter 's relationship has developed over the three seasons ? \" Obviously Josh [ Jackson ] and I loved the development in the first two seasons until it all fell apart . This season , even though it 's essential it 's been this way , it 's been really hard because we want to play them as getting along really well . But we ca n't because there 's obviously this friction between the two of them . We had a really interesting struggle this year personally because we like the relationship . To play all that tension has been challenging . But it 's been good for the characters and it 's real that they should be so strained at this point . \" Where do you think the show will go in the future ? \" The future depends on whether we finish this year or play for six seasons or ten , whatever . The writers have scenarios for all of those options . The first thing we need to do is come to some resolution about the alternate universe and our universe in conflict . Obviously we ca n't destroy one of them because by the law of physics , if we destroy one we destroy the other . So there has to be a resolution of that and I think there will be some resolution of that in this season - we still have n't had the last two scripts though . Beyond that , if that did happen , I would see a pact being created and then some external threat of some description would make complete sense . I know the writers have so many ideas . One of them said to me the other day , ' We could play for 20 years just with the ideas we 've got ' . We 've certainly played out this conflict between the two universes this year and that will need to be resolved to some degree , not completely but resolved to some degree , by the end of the season . \" What else can fans expect as the season comes to a close ? \" There will be a tremendous build up of tension . It 's a very dark period because you 're looking at the end of the world essentially , unless something is done . So we 're going through the doomsday scenarios . Unless we 're going to blow the world up , there has to be a resolution and that 's really difficult and creates tremendous tension and pressure on all the characters . I guess by the end of season three it will be an enormous buildup to someone about to hit the button and then they either will hit the button or they wo n't . But I know already that the tension is enormous in the stories . \" Fringe has evolved from one - off episodes to a longer story arc - how do you feel about that ? \" On a personal level I like it . It probably makes it more difficult for fans to drop in and say , ' Oh I 'm going to watch the show ' and have any idea what 's going on , because it 's so mythology - based now . But for our hardcore fans it 's perfect because they have an investment in the mythology and the ongoing stories and the ongoing character arcs . I do n't think it could have stayed as a ' monster of the week ' - I do n't think it would have been interesting to continue forever doing that . They could have , but to me personally I prefer the way we 've gone with it . \" We 've heard rumours that William Bell will be back - can you say anything about that ? \" I've heard the same rumours ! In fact , I think Leonard [ Nimoy ] announced it on his Twitter or something . All I can say is that there will be a return of Leonard 's character in a way . In a way . It 's not going to be , ' Hey , here 's Leonard again ' . It will be something different but really quite bizarre . Very bizarre , in fact . \" What are your hopes for Walter in the future ? \" Walter is a man who has gone through certain periods in his life and is now in his golden years and is trying to resolve himself with his creator , with the people around him . It 's quite biblical in a sense , the way he 's trying to come to grips with what he 's done and seek a rounding out and forgiveness . That continues on and it has to continue on , simply because he is an older man . He just continues to evolve almost in a religious sense until he finds some sort of peace and resolution . It would be ridiculous to do it otherwise . So I guess there will be a continuing unravelling and maybe a growing wisdom in the old man . I think that 's what will happen . \" Fringe has controversially been moved to Friday nights in the US - what are your thoughts ? \" I kind of like the move to Friday nights . I thought it was a really good move for us because it gave us a home base . Thursday night in America was never a good night for us ... It was n't a great spot for us up against Grey 's Anatomy and all those things . This is perfect for us . This is the spot that The X Files made their own . And it was sitting there waiting to be taken to be honest with you , because nothing was working in there . So far , so good . I 'd be quite happy to stay on Friday nights . \" Do you think Fringe will be renewed for another season ? The fans want it . \" The fans do want it , and the interesting thing about Fringe is that I know the executives at Fox and the executives at Warner Bros really love Fringe , they 're very proud of it . The challenge they have is , ' Well , OK , do enough people watch it to justify it ? ' That 's where they 're sitting at present . They obviously have to drop some shows this year to let other shows in . The chances of Fringe returning I 'd say are pretty good , but I ca n't really say any more than that . I would n't like to be making the decision they have to make and I think they 're probably making that decision almost as we speak . I know that sentimentally they want Fringe to remain - I know that for a fact . \" Fringe returns in the UK on Wednesday at 10 pm on Sky1 . Are you pleased that Fringe is back ? What do you think will happen in the new episodes ? Leave your comments below !"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Soldiers and health technicians hopped in jeeps and secretly roped sheep and cattle grazing near Hanford . Then , they pressed Geiger counters to the animals ' thyroids to check for the presence of radioactive iodine 131 . The roundup was ordered by the late Herbert Parker - a formal and aloof English radiologist who was Hanford 's first chief of health and safety . Parker fretted about the huge clouds of iodine 131 gas spewing from the stacks of central Hanford 's B Plant and T Plant - where plutonium was chemically extracted from nuclear fuel rods . Parker knew iodine 131 affected thyroid glands . But he did n't know what amounts were unsafe for people . It was a problem he kept trying to calculate . He and other scientists had struggled for years to find out how iodine 131 - which loses half its radioactivity every eight days - enters human bodies . Early on , they believed iodine and other radionuclides settled on vegetation that birds and animals ate . And they noted hunters ate game animals . In the late 1940s , technicians stalked rabbits , coyotes and birds to find excessive amounts of iodine 131 in their thyroids , according to On The Home Front , a Hanford history book written by longtime site historian Michele Gerber . For decades , the government kept secret any speculation about the risks of radioactive iodine to folks downwind from the plutonium plants . The official word was Hanford 's neighbors had nothing to worry about . But in the government - owned town of Richland , home to most of Hanford 's workers , there were some curious rules that seem aimed at preventing iodine 131 from moving through the food chain , Gerber noted . Chickens and livestock were banned , and Richland pasture land was off limits for grazing . The government constantly was testing the milk and water . Richland 's milk supply came from the Yakima and Ellensburg areas - upwind of Hanford . Hanford officials often cautioned Richlanders against drinking \" poor quality \" milk from the rural areas near town , Gerber said . Milk from cows grazing on contaminated pastures is one of the most direct ways for radioactive iodine to reach humans . Although Gerber did n't find evidence directly linking the Richland rules to iodine hazards , the circumstantial evidence is there . \" You certainly have to raise the questions , \" Gerber said . Of course , for most of the past 50 years , no one outside a small cadre of experts was asking serious questions about Hanford emissions , despite the threat to human health . Releases of iodine 131 from Hanford smokestacks began soon after the first nuclear reactors fired up at Hanford . By far , the greatest releases of iodine 131 came from 1944 and 1951 , when emissions totaled an estimated 727,900 curies . After 1951 , special filters and other safety practices cut emissions dramatically . In fact , 98 percent of the overall curies of iodine released over the 28 years ending in 1972 went out the stacks in the first eight years of Hanford operations , according to the Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project . The iodine emissions accounted for nearly all the radiation doses from all types of airborne releases at Hanford . A key reason for the peak during those early years of the Cold War was that Hanford was experimenting with ways to increase plutonium production . One way to get plutonium quicker was to shorten the time that irradiated fuel rods cooled before going to the extraction plants . A side effect of shorter cooling times was that the radioactive iodine did n't have as long to decay before the fuel went into the plants . As a result , thousands of curies of radioactive iodine routinely were sent out Hanford 's smokestacks . By contrast , about 15 curies of radioactive iodine was released in the 1979 Three Mile Island reactor incident in Pennsylvania . The wall of secrecy surrounding Hanford began to crumble as the Cold War drew to a close in the late 1980s . Among the thousands of pages of declassified documents was an account of the so-called Green Run of 1949 . In terms of radiation dose , the Green Run 's 8,000 - curie release pales in comparison with the years of routine emissions . But the federal government 's decision to use the Northwest as an outdoor laboratory for radiation experiments still rankles many . Much about the Green Run still is classified , but numerous clues indicate America 's Cold War scientists wanted to learn how to monitor Soviet nuclear weapon production by tracking iodine releases . So an intentional release of iodine was set up at T Plant . It was dubbed the Green Run because so - called \" green \" fuel was used . That fuel had cooled only 16 days instead of the then - normal 90 or more days - giving iodine little time to decay . Scientists wanted a night experiment when cold layers of air near the ground would keep particles airborne until they were diluted . Plus , they wanted no rain , no low clouds and light winds . They figured 4,000 curies of iodine would be released . But the night of Dec. 2 - 3 , 1949 , was cloudier than expected , and the winds kept shifting . Calculations were off , and almost 8,000 curies of iodine 131 were released . And soon afterward , rain and snow came to force the iodine particles down all over the inland Northwest . One follow - up iodine 131 reading on vegetation in Kennewick was almost 1,000 times the limit set at that time . In 1950 , special filters were put on the processing plants ' smokestacks to capture iodine . Emissions dropped to a fraction of previous counts . But Hanford had an accidental release of 15,000 curies over several weeks in 1951 when the filters failed . Meanwhile , scientists kept researching iodine 131's health effects . They fed iodine 131 pellets to sheep kept at a facility near Hanford 's F Reactor in 1950 and 1951 and did autopsies on the carcasses . The then - classified study showed thyroid damage and changes in blood and hormone levels in the sheep . Also in 1951 , the Atomic Energy Commission - the forerunner of today 's Department of Energy - released a public report that declared releases of iodine 131 and other radionuclides were low and posed no hazards to plants and animals . Gerber noted all Hanford 's iodine and thyroid studies were kept classified until the 1980s . Scientists continued studying iodine and thyroid disease at Hanford and elsewhere . In 1954 , Hanford scientists were sent to Utah to check on sheep killed from iodine - laced fallout from atomic bomb tests , she said . Meanwhile , some research addressed strong suspicions that iodine 131 landing on vegetation came to humans through cows ' milk . \" They did n't get the connection with milk for a long time . They knew ( iodine ) landed on the vegetation , \" Gerber said . In 1963 , an AEC scientist publicly acknowledged that link with a report on the abrupt increase of iodine 131 in milk and subsequently in human thyroids after atomic bomb tests in Nevada , Gerber said . She believes the AEC was certain about the connection prior to that publication . However , it was not until the mid-1980s that public questions and concerns about Hanford radiation releases and people 's health gained major momentum . That was spearheaded by newspaper articles on \" downwinders \" and a massive 1986 release of 19,000 pages of previously classified documents that included information on iodine and thyroids . The federal Centers for Disease Control began pondering the need to find out how much radiation people living \" downwind \" of Hanford would have absorbed from 1944 to 1972 . And the agency thought a study was needed to see if a link existed between Hanford 's iodine emissions and the region 's thyroid problems . DOE agreed to a dose- reconstruction study , and it put Hanford contractor Battelle in charge . But public concerns surfaced whether DOE and one of its contractors could conduct an impartial and credible study on Hanford emissions . So an independent panel of scientists - dubbed the Technical Steering Panel - was put in charge . Much of the public did n't believe the panel had the clout to assert its independence . And Battelle - while sharing technical data - balked at sharing budget information on the research . The panel had to pressure Battelle to open up . And it requested overall responsibility for the study be shifted from DOE to improve credibility . In 1992 , the Department of Health and Human Services assumed responsibility for the study , and CDC began providing the money . In 1994 , the panel unveiled its final estimates on how much airborne radionuclides - dominated by iodine 131 - Northwest downwinders likely absorbed through the food chain . The numbers varied according to geography , ages and eating and drinking habits . Babies and children were among the higher risks . And these were just estimates within ranges of maximum and minimum possible doses . Many average doses were a few hundred times the levels people would receive from naturally occurring background radiation . The remainder varied widely , from a few dozen times that of background levels to a few thousand times background levels . The big problem was : What did these numbers really mean when looking at thyroid problems ? And that 's what the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center 's thyroid study - begun in 1991 - was supposed to tell Thursday . Copyright 1999 Tri-City Herald . All rights reserved .

During an impromptu speech at the event at the Park Lane Hilton on Tuesday , Bob Geldof congratulated the Sun for its coverage of the Band Aid campaign for Africa but went on to attack the rest of the industry . He said the Daily Mail 's coverage of Comic Relief was ' a disgrace ' and criticised Independent editor Simon Kelner for failing to deliver a front - page story on the crisis in Africa . Daily Mirror editor Richard Wallace , reportedly furious with the rock star 's pro-Sun rant , later argued with Mr Geldof outside the event . Ten editors released a joint statement on Friday withdrawing their support for the awards because of the ' decline in conduct and prestige ' of the event . \" The editors of the Guardian , the Observer , the Daily Telegraph , the Sunday Telegraph , the Independent , the Independent on Sunday , the Daily Express , the Sunday Express , the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday believe the organisation of these awards brings little credit to the industry or to the newspapers who win them , \" said the statement . \" Discussions are now going on about what should happen in the future . \" The Evening Standard has since joined the boycott and the Financial Times and Mirror Group are also expected to follow suit . \" There seems to be a widespread feeling that we could , as an industry , come up with awards - and an awards ceremony - which better reflected the best of British journalism , \" said Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger . The British Press Awards are organised by the UK trade publication Press Gazette . \" What 's annoyed us is that some of the stuff written over the weekend has been about improving the judging process - some of it even implying there is something corrupt about it , \" said Press Gazette editor Ian Reeves . \" That is absolutely ludicrous .

It also may be one of the more unlikely . A key cog in the Class A Lakewood offense , Scheiner reached what would have been the end of the road for most players in his situation four years ago . Despite a solid career at Maria Carrillo Pumas High School in Santa Rosa , California , the infielder received little interest from schools or scouts . His lone option as far as baseball was concerned was attending a local junior college , where he wound up red-shirting as a freshman . \" In high school I was good at defense , but I was a smaller player , \" said the 6 - foot - 1 , 200 - pounder . \" Then I had to red -shirt my first year in junior college because I would have been splitting time .

Scheiner was recognized as the Big 8 Most Valuable Player as well as the NorCal Player of the Year , a First Team All - American and state championship MVP . While professional baseball continued to show little interest , he received offers from a handful of collegiate programs and wound up at the University of Houston . In what proved to be his lone season with the Cougars , Scheiner paced the team in the Triple Crown categories with a .346 batting average , 18 home runs and 64 RBIs . He led the American Athletic Conference in roundtrippers and was named the conference 's Player of the Year as well as a Second Team All -American .

Scheiner also is making consistent contact , evidenced by his 59 strikeouts versus 33 walks . His offensive output is more impressive considering his defensive responsibilities . After splitting his time between second and third base last year at Williamsport , he has made 20 starts at first base , 45 at the hot corner and 21 in left field . While the first turn and the outfield are unfamiliar territory , Scheiner has responded to the challenge with aplomb by making only seven errors , two coming at third base on Opening Day . \" There 's been a lot of hours of work put in and it 's good to see things starting to pay off , \" he said . \" The goal now is to stay consistent while I keep working and getting better every year , which is what I 've been doing the last few seasons .

Tyrone Gilliam Sr. told protesters outside the Maryland Penitentiary in Baltimore that his son had a message for them : \" I will live on through love , through God . \" None of Doerfler 's family members asked to be present for the execution . None of Gilliam 's were allowed to attend . At 10 p.m. , Gilliam was escorted into the 16-by - 15 - foot death chamber last night and strapped to a 300 - pound gurney . Four minutes later , execution commander William L. Sondervan gave the signal to start the flow of lethal drugs -- sodium pentothal to render him unconscious , pavulon to paralyze his muscles and potassium chloride to stop his heart . Wearing an orange jumpsuit , white socks that had \" Caresteps \" written on the bottom , and holding a blue Nation of Islam cap in his left hand , Gilliam lay on the gurney in the penitentiary hospital . He smiled when he saw his attorney , Jerome H. Nickerson Jr. , and his spiritual adviser , Ashidda Muhammad , who were among the 14 witnesses . \" Allah , forgive them , for they know not what they do , \" Gilliam said to the witnesses . Gilliam nodded at Nickerson and Muhammad , then said , \" I love you . \" He said one last thing : \" Allahu Akbar , \" Arabic for \" God is the greatest . \" Nickerson and Muhammad repeated the statement . Gilliam shifted back to the center of the table and closed his eyes . His chest heaved three or four times . His lips began to flutter . At 10 : 27 p.m. , Gilliam was pronounced dead , the 83rd man to be executed in Maryland history . For years , the Doerfler family declined to speak publicly about the slaying . Those who know the Doerflers say the family regarded the murder as a private matter . Both parents wrote to Gov. Parris N. Glendening to share their differing views on Gilliam 's fate , and they asked that the letters be kept confidential . Mrs. Doerfler wanted Gilliam 's life to be spared ; Mr. Doerfler did not . Gilliam became well - known in national anti-death penalty circles . Raised in the working - class Baltimore County neighborhood of Middle River , Gilliam had had only one conviction -- for robbery -- at the time of the murder . In the months before his death , Gilliam spoke from Baltimore 's Supermax prison by telephone to activists around the country . Gilliam and his attorney fought furiously to block the execution . They claimed in the last few days that one of Gilliam 's partners pulled the trigger that night 10 years ago , and that Gilliam did n't deserve to die . But the arguments were rebuffed every step of the way . At noon yesterday , Glendening denied a plea for mercy , calling the murder \" particularly brutal [ and ] heinous . \" Five hours later , the U.S. Supreme Court turned down a final appeal . Minister Louis Farrakhan and Baltimore Cardinal William H. Keeler , who opposes the death penalty , sent letters urging Glendening to grant clemency to Gilliam , who belonged to Farrakhan 's Nation of Islam . At 5 p.m. , Gilliam was told that his appeals had been denied . A prison spokesman said Gilliam took the news calmly . \" He 's fully prepared to die , \" said Leonard A. Sipes Jr. In the hours before his death , Gilliam stayed in a cell about 35 feet from the execution chamber , where he was visited by his father , his mother , his grandfather , a Roman Catholic priest and two Islamic ministers . Gilliam refused his last supper , a choice between roast beef and fried chicken . \" He felt pensive , \" Sipes said . \" He knew he was going to be executed , and he wanted to spend the time with his family and his spiritual advisers . \" Gilliam spent much of the day on the phone . \" He 's been speaking with attorneys , religious leaders and his family , \" Sipes said early in the evening . \" He fully recognizes that he will be executed . He seems to be very much at peace with what 's coming . \" Death penalty protest Outside the prison , more than 200 death penalty opponents lined East Madison Street , shouting , \" One , two , three , four , stop the killing of the poor . \" They carried signs that read \" Stop State Killing , \" \" Death Penalty Equals Murder \" and \" Stop Glendening Before He Kills Again . \" \" I have to do my little part to say no , \" said protester John Furst of Parkville . \" There 's a general level of ignorance in the population , and executions are going to continue to happen , unfortunately . But I 'm not going to just sit at home and do nothing . \" Lorig Charkordian , a coordinator of the Maryland Coalition Against State Executions , a Baltimore group , said she was troubled by Gilliam 's execution because of questions about who pulled the trigger . \" One of the problems with the death penalty is that it sometimes puts to death innocent people , \" Charkordian said . \" This is one of those cases that makes you wonder . \" Speaking to reporters outside the penitentiary less than a half - hour after the execution , Gilliam 's attorney called the governor \" a coward . \" \" The whole state saw what he did , \" Nickerson said . \" He makes the statement that he believes that my client is a cold - blooded killer . Well , my client never got his day in court as to whether or not he was eligible for the death penalty . But there 's one thing that we did establish tonight , and that is that Governor Glendening is the coldest , bloodiest killer that we have ever encountered . \" Thomas Forsythe of Highlandtown was the only demonstrator outside the penitentiary to visibly support the execution . \" Somebody has to stand up for this lady , \" said Forsythe , a house painter . \" I think this guy and his two accomplices ought to all get the death penalty . There was no need for what they did . They could have taken the $ 3 and left . They did n't have to kill her . For that , they should die . \" Forsy the held a sign . \" We Must Mourn All Victims of Murder , \" it read . \" Ms. Doerfler had a life , too . \" Drugs and crime A month before the 1988 murder , Gilliam -- a longtime drug user -- secured a $ 2,600 school loan to become a barber , according to court records . Gilliam used the money to buy drugs . He and his co-defendants , brothers Delano \" Tony \" Drummond and Kelvin Drummond , started using cocaine daily , mixing it with PCP . When the trio ran up a $ 700 debt with a drug dealer , Kelvin Drummond stole a gray Chevrolet Nova and three snowsuits . They added a sawed - off shotgun to their inventory , and on Dec. 1 , 1988 , they hatched a plan for a robbery spree while using drugs at a friend 's house . Gilliam said he wanted to kill a woman . Kelvin Drummond thought he was joking . Their first stop on Dec. 2 was a Burger King in Harford County . Kelvin Drummond grabbed the shotgun and walked to the car window of a woman waiting in the drive - through . She sped off , escaping . The Doerfler slaying They then went to a nearby townhouse complex , where they robbed a woman of her pocketbook before heading south to Perry Hall . As the men drove down Joppa Road , Doerfler was having dinner with her father and sister . The youngest of nine children , Doerfler belonged to the Shrine of the Little Flower church in Northeast Baltimore and sang folk songs for Sunday Mass . After graduating from Mercy High School , Doerfler worked as a hardware store accountant and planned to attend Loyola College , just like her brothers and sisters . That December night , Doerfler 's father decided to order submarine sandwiches . They sat on the living room floor , watched television and ate . At 7 p.m. , Doerfler said she was going to rent a movie and drive to her sister 's house , 25 minutes away . When she pulled up in her blue Nissan , Tony Drummond and Gilliam forced their way into her car . Drive , they told her . Give us your money . She said she had none , just $ 3 and an ATM card . They looked for a bank and then told her to turn down Gum Spring Road , a dead - end lovers ' lane in Rossville . They pulled her keys kept on a Donald Duck ring from the ignition . Kelvin Drummond testified that he saw Gilliam standing at the side of Doerfler 's car . She was in the driver 's seat and Gilliam was talking to her , one hand on the shotgun , the other resting on the car . Kelvin Drummond said he suddenly heard a loud boom and saw the flash of the shotgun . \" She was , like , face - first into the steering wheel , \" he testified . Gilliam told his partners he killed Doerfler because he did n't want any witnesses . After the murder , the trio went to Golden Ring Mall , where they had dinner with their girlfriends at the Italian Delight restaurant . Two days later , Gilliam was arrested after robbing a convenience store . He confessed to the murder and told police that it was an accident . It was the first of several confessions . His attorney said in court that he shot Doerfler during a drug-induced daze -- an argument that Baltimore Circuit Judge John F. Fader II rejected . \" I do n't think that that is a proposition that society can abide by , \" he said during Gilliam 's sentencing hearing on Oct. 31 , 1989 . An apology Before he was sentenced , Gilliam apologized to the Doerfler family . \" I 'm sorry , and I could n't imagine how you feel toward me , and I do n't know if you forgive me or not . But I am truly sorry . \" He then turned to the judge . \" Your Honor , I know that I have to be punished for this and I am ready to pay for it , \" Gilliam said , \" but I just ask you not to give me the death penalty . \" Pub Date : 11/17/98"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Is there a future in writing records the same way back when Ritual de lo Habitual came out ? The way I look at it is this : Jane 's Addiction has got a catalog , and we can go out and perform for 70 minutes and people know all those songs , so for us , if you 're asking me my opinion , the best thing that we can do is try to come up with a single every once in a while to add into the set that you can distribute via online , and that 's where my head is at . But I do think it 's important to continue to be creative . Those creative juices , that 's musical currency . For as much as we love all the old songs , even I would love to hear a new song from Pink Floyd if they got back together , or Van Halen . I do n't need to hear a whole record , but I 'd love to hear one cool new song from them that was maybe being passed around via the Internet . That 's what I 'd like to see . It 's a different situation with a new group , a new group that does n't have 70 minutes worth of quality material that people want to hear , so you 've got to create that 70 minutes worth of quality material . That 's why there would be a need for new groups to have albums . Even you would probably not appreciate Jane 's Addiction if we showed up in your town and we only played 70 minutes of new material . If we did n't play any oldies , you 'd probably be bummed out . People want something that they 're familiar with . Something that they love . They fell in love . That 's what they want . So you 're not interested in the old album cycle ? I am not , but I tell you what , do n't count it out , because the business might dictate that something like that occurs someday in the future . Just out of , I guess , contractual obligations , you might say . I ca n't really speak too much more about that . ( laughs ) ( laughs ) Okay , but did the original goal of the recording process work of getting your creativity flowing together in a studio ? Yes , exactly . But not for the purposes of writing a record . It was just for the purpose of : We 're going out , there are all these great new tools for us to distribute our music , and let 's come up with something new so we can perform one new song in the set . I think that would be really fun . I 'm just looking at it purely as an artist , not as any kind of signed artist , or from the recording industry perspective , I 'm looking at it purely as a troubadour . At the same time , you just released this massive physical box set for collectors . Do you feel you have to maintain that relationship with this vast amount of new media and the people who want everyone on vinyl , on plastic , etc .? That is true , but let me tell you , that box set was supposed to be released two years ago . It just took so long . We cut that deal on the box set when we were still together on the last record , and it took that long to get it coordinated and gathered and all those other things and it was just kind of a happenstance that we were together at this time . When Rhino saw that we were together they thought , ' Let 's just really work day and night and get the thing out . ' Jane 's Addiction perform at PNC Bank Arts Center on June 6 .

The first part of his career saw him as apprentice and lead boy to some of the greatest blues and religious artists ever , including Willie Walker , Blind Blake , Blind Joe Taggart ( with whom he recorded ) , and allegedly even Blind Lemon Jefferson . On his own , he recorded both blues and religious songs , including a classic version of \" Blood Red River . \" A fine guitar technician with an appealing voice , he became progressively more sophisticated in his presentation . Like many other Carolinians and Virginians who moved north to urban areas , he took up city ways , remaining a fine musician if no longer a down - home artist . Like several other canny blues players , he used his roots music to broaden and enhance his life experience , and his talent was such that he could choose the musical idiom that was most lucrative at the time . ~ Barry Lee Pearson , All Music Guide Great performance !

Some concern is definitely understandable , especially since certain infections are widespread and potentially dangerous , such as COVID - 19 and the flu . Fortunately , you may already be immune to a number of other contagious diseases . And thanks to a successful vaccination program , some illnesses , like rubella ( German measles ) , are now rare in the United States . You can also take comfort in the fact that most babies are n't harmed if their mother develops an infection during pregnancy . But some infections can be transmitted to babies through the placenta or during birth . When that happens , it may have serious consequences . What 's more , some infections can make you sicker if you get them when you 're pregnant , or they may lead to complications like preterm labor . Infections and pregnancy : Why you 're more at risk during pregnancy When you 're pregnant , your immune system works a bit differently than it normally does . Your hormone levels change considerably , as well . These factors make you more susceptible to some infections . You 're more likely to be infected with listeria , a foodborne illness , for example . Physical changes brought on by pregnancy can also raise your risk for certain infections . For instance , your odds of a kidney infection are higher , partly because of the pressure your growing baby places on your urinary tract . But your chance of getting sick in the first place is n't the only thing influenced by pregnancy . It can also affect how sick you may become . Pregnant women are more likely to get seriously ill with certain infections , including herpes simplex virus and the flu . In 2009 for example , pregnant women represented 5 percent of deaths from the flu , even though they only made up 1 percent of the population . Some infections present a greater risk to your baby , while others put you in more danger \u2013 and certain infections can be equally hazardous for both of you . Because of this , it 's important that you understand a few basics about common contagious diseases . What infections are common during pregnancy ? Here 's a list of some of the infections that can affect a pregnancy : Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) is an infection of the vagina that can cause itching and discharge . Though it 's not transmitted by having sex , you 're more likely to develop BV if you 're sexually active . During pregnancy , the infection can raise your baby 's chances of premature birth and low birthweight . Fortunately , BV is easily treated with antibiotics . Chickenpox is caused by the varicella- zoster virus ( VZV ) and was a common childhood illness in the United States until 1995 , when a vaccine became widely available . Its hallmark is an itchy , blistery rash , though fever and fatigue are also typical symptoms . Coming down with chickenpox when you 're pregnant can cause serious complications for both you and your baby , including pneumonia , birth defects , and low birthweight . The best way to prevent the disease is through vaccination prior to pregnancy , because you cannot receive the shot while you 're pregnant . So , be sure to avoid anyone you know that has chickenpox and let your healthcare provider know right away if you 're exposed . Chikungunya is a virus transmitted via an infected mosquito . Though there are occasional U.S. outbreaks , it is exceedingly rare here , with just 29 cases reported to the CDC in 2020 . Fever and joint pain are common symptoms , and recovery usually takes within seven days . Contracting chikungunya can lead to preterm labor , a lack of amniotic fluid in your placenta , and the death of the fetus . There is no vaccine or cure , though you can treat symptoms and lower your risk by guarding against mosquito bites in affected areas of the globe . Chlamydia during pregnancy is associated with leaking amniotic fluid , preterm labor , and low birthweight . Your baby can be infected during delivery , which may result in conjunctivitis ( pinkeye ) or pneumonia . There were about 1.8 million cases of the sexually transmitted disease reported to the CDC in 2019 , though the actual count is likely much higher . That 's probably because most people do n't have symptoms , which can include discharge , pain , bleeding , and burning . Chlamydia is treated with antibiotics and may be prevented by using a condom every time you have sex . COVID - 19 infection carries serious risks for pregnant and recently pregnant women , especially if you have other health conditions . Premature birth is one potential complication , and you 're at higher risk for having a stillbirth . You 're also more likely than non-pregnant women to become seriously ill and to need hospitalization , intensive care , or a ventilator . Your chances of dying are increased , as well . Being vaccinated is by far the best way of preventing COVID - 19 . The shot can be taken while you 're pregnant \u2013 it will not give you or your baby the coronavirus . Speak with your provider if you have n't received your vaccine already , if you 've come in contact with an infected person , or if you have COVID - 19 symptoms . Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) passes from one person to another via bodily fluids such as blood , saliva , or urine . It affects more than half of U.S. adults by age 40 and sticks around for life , though most people will never develop symptoms or even know they have the disease . Infected pregnant women can pass CMV to their babies , who are usually do n't have symptoms , but may develop problems with their brain , lungs , liver , or spleen . Hearing loss can occur up to 2 years later . The risk of growth problems and stillbirth is increased as well . If your provider suspects CMV , a blood test can detect the virus in adults , while a urine or saliva test is preferred for infants . Treatment is not yet recommended during pregnancy , but your baby may require treatment after birth . Dengue fever is , like chikungunya , transmitted by infected mosquitos and rare in the U.S. When Americans do develop the illness , it 's almost always because they 've traveled to high - risk areas . Symptoms include fever , rash , and pain . Dengue is potentially life - threatening if you become severely ill . If a pregnant person contracts the disease , it may cause low birthweight , premature delivery , or even death of the fetus . If you 're concerned about the possibility of dengue , speak with your healthcare provider before heading abroad . Fifth disease ( parvovirus B19 ) is a common , mild childhood illness that causes fever and rash and usually clears up between one and three weeks . It typically is n't an issue during pregnancy , though in rare cases , the mother may miscarry or her baby may develop anemia . While there is no treatment for fifth disease , avoiding sick people and washing your hands thoroughly and often can help keep you from getting sick . Your provider may want you to be tested if you 're exposed ; many pregnant women are already immune to parvovirus B19 . Flu can be extraordinarily harmful for both you and your baby if you 're infected while pregnant . You may end up with pneumonia , or deliver prematurely . If you have persistently high fevers early in the pregnancy , your baby may develop birth defects , as well , including some that affect the brain and spinal cord . So , contact your provider right away if you have fever , chills , a cough , a sore throat , or any other common signs . And keep in mind \u2014 year in and year out , the best way of preventing the illness is receiving your annual flu shot , which is recommended during pregnancy . Gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics once the sexually transmitted disease is identified by a provider ; common symptoms include vaginal discharge and burning during urination . When left untreated , however , gonorrhea can lead to miscarriage , preterm delivery , and low birthweight . It may cause your water to break early , or for the fluid to become infected . Your newborn can also be infected at birth , and there 's a small chance they 'll develop pinkeye . Group B strep ( GBS ) is a kind of bacteria that lives in your digestive and reproductive systems . It affects about one - quarter of pregnant women , and you will be tested for it around week 37 of your pregnancy . If you 're positive and your GBS is not treated with antibiotics during labor , there is a small chance you could pass it to your baby at that point . Babies with a GBS infection may develop pneumonia , sepsis , or meningitis , which can cause additional health issues down the line . In a worst - case scenario , an infected baby can die . Pregnant people may develop complications , too , including a uterine infection . Testing and antibiotics are the best prevention methods for GBS . Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) affects more than 850,000 people in the U.S. , according to the CDC . A serious liver infection transmitted via blood , semen , and other bodily fluids , HBV can be short - or long - term , and may lead to life - threatening conditions such as cirrhosis or liver cancer . If you 're pregnant and have HBV , there is a 10 % to 20 % chance you will pass it to your baby during labor and birth . With no treatment , your baby can develop a chronic infection and severe liver problems . The best method of preventing HBV is through vaccination , which can be done during pregnancy , and immunization is recommended for all infants Herpes , or genital herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) infection , is a sexually transmitted infection that 's dangerous if it 's passed to your baby in the womb or during delivery . Sores , blindness , organ damage , and a serious brain disorder called herpes encephalitis can result . Lower your chance of contracting herpes by having safe sex . If you have a history of genital HSV , your provider will prescribe you medication in the last month of pregnancy to reduce outbreaks . You should be especially aware of skin-to - skin contact when you have mouth sores . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) can be passed to your baby if you 're infected . Transmission may happen through the placenta during pregnancy , via vaginal fluids during birth , or by means of breastmilk after birth . That said , treatment has come a long way since AIDS deaths peaked in the mid-1990s . Now , with the right medications and precautions , people with HIV live nearly as long as people without HIV . What 's more , fetal infection can almost always be prevented with medications . If you know you have HIV and are pregnant or trying to conceive , it 's critical that you speak with your provider about treatment . Listeriosis can be contracted by eating food contaminated by the bacteria L. monocytogenes \u2013 usually ready - to - eat poultry , meats , seafood , or dairy . Sometimes , it comes from eating produce grown in contaminated soil . The disease kills about 260 Americans each year , and pregnant people \u2013\u2013 are much more susceptible than others . Miscarriage , preterm labor , and stillbirth can result . If you pass listeriosis to your baby , it can cause infections , serious lifelong medical issues , and death . Reach out to your provider immediately if you suspect you have the illness , but know that symptoms , including fever , muscle aches , and fatigue , may not show for up to two months . To prevent listeriosis , refrigerate all perishable foods and leftovers , and throw away anything that 's been left on the counter for more than two hours . Rubella ( German measles ) is a viral infection . It may cause flu-like symptoms in adults , and life - threatening health issues for your baby if you become sick during pregnancy . Miscarriage , stillbirth , developmental delays , heart defects , and cataracts are just a few possible complications . Cases of rubella are extremely rare in the U.S. , with only 15 babies reported born with it from 2005 - 2018 , according to the CDC . That 's because the vast majority of Americans have had the measles , mumps , and rubella ( MMR ) vaccine \u2013 a safe , effective two - dose shot commonly given during infancy and young childhood . Still , your provider will make sure you 're up - to-date . Sexually transmitted infections ( STIs or STDs ) are diseases you can contract by having vaginal , oral , or anal sex with someone who is infected . They lead to a range of mild - to - severe medical problems for both pregnant people and their fetuses . Testing and treatment is key for averting these issues , though limiting your number of partners or using condoms can reduce your risk overall . Common STIs include : - Chlamydia - Genital herpes - Gonorrhea - Hepatitis B - Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) - Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) - Syphilis While some other illnesses can be transmitted by having sex , they 're more commonly spread in other ways . These include cytomegalovirus and Zika . Syphilis can lead to miscarriage , premature birth , umbilical cord problems , and stillbirth . If your baby is born with syphilis , they may die within a few days or develop severe health problems that will be with them for life . Awareness is especially important for pregnant women because cases of the sexually transmitted disease have skyrocketed in recent years , both in parents and newborns . A reported 1,870 babies were born with syphilis in 2019 , up from just 358 in 2011 . Though pregnant people are routinely screened for the infection , you should report symptoms to your provider right away . The first signs often include genital , anal , or oral sores , while later signs may include body rash and flu-like symptoms . Syphilis is treated with penicillin . Toxoplasmosis comes from contaminated cat litter or feces , though it can also be present in tainted soil or meat . Caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii , the disease is typically mild for adults . However , if it 's passed to the fetus , toxoplasmosis can lead to poor growth , premature delivery , miscarriage , and stillbirth . Infants may have eye issues or brain damage present at birth , though more often , problems do n't show up until years later . If you 're trying to conceive or are already pregnant and have a cat , ask someone else to change the litter each day . If the chore is left up to you , make sure you wear gloves , and wash your hands when you 're finished . Trichomoniasis also called tric , is a very common , very curable sexually transmitted infection . It causes symptoms in about one - third of infected people \u2013 typically itchy genitals , discharge , and burning when you pee . If you 're pregnant , the risk of early delivery and low birth weight increase . Let your provider know if you see signs of tric ; you 'll be given medication if you 're diagnosed . Urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) are typically caused by bacteria that travel up through your urethra . Most UTIs occur in your bladder ( cystitis ) , though some happen in your kidneys ( pyelonephritis ) , and you 're particularly prone to them during pregnancy . Bladder infections often lead to pain and burning when you pee , as well as a constant urge to use the bathroom . Kidney infections can cause fever , chills , vomiting , and pain in your lower back or sides . Tell your provider if you have any symptoms , but especially if you suspect your kidneys are affected , since it can have life- threatening consequences for both you and your baby . Providers treat UTIs with oral antibiotics over the course of a few days . Lower your risk of getting one by hydrating , not holding it when you have to pee , wiping from front to back after using the toilet , and keeping your genital area clean . Yeast infection during pregnancy is very common , thanks to changes in your hormones . The good news is , beyond an annoying itch and thick , white vaginal discharge , it wo n't pose much danger to you or your baby . Report symptoms anyway , so you can get treatment and just in case you may have a more serious problem . If you 're diagnosed , know that yeast infection pregnancy treatment differs slightly from the usual treatment in one big way : You wo n't be given an oral antifungal like fluconazole . Instead , you 'll receive a vaginal medicine , such as a tablet , suppository , or cream . Clotrimazole , miconazole , and terconazole are popular options . Zika virus is another illness mostly spread by mosquitos , though it can also be transmitted sexually . There is no vaccine , treatment , or cure . It 's very dangerous for pregnant people , linked to miscarriage , stillbirth , and birth defects like microcephaly , a condition in which a baby 's head is much smaller than it should be . Though there have been just a handful of U.S. Zika infections in recent years , 2016 saw a large outbreak . More than 5,000 cases were reported in the states and over 36,000 cases were found in U.S. territories \u2013 the vast majority in Puerto Rico . Pregnant people and those trying to conceive should avoid travel to places with Zika outbreaks . If you must travel , take precautions to prevent mosquito bites . How can I protect myself from infections during pregnancy ? You ca n't completely avoid all sources of infection while you 're pregnant . But you can take certain steps to make it less likely that you 'll get sick , and to reduce the risk of serious problems for you or your baby if you do get an infection . Most importantly , getting prenatal care is crucial . For example , simple blood tests can tell you whether you 're immune to certain infections , such as chickenpox and rubella . You 'll also be tested for infections you may not know you have , including UTIs , group B strep , hepatitis B , and HIV . If you think you 've been exposed to a serious infection or you become ill , getting care in a timely manner can often help prevent complications . You can do a number of things on your own , too . Basic measures will reduce your risk of getting sick : - Wash your hands . Do it thoroughly and often . If soap and water are not available , use an alcohol - based hand sanitizer and rub your hands together until they 're dry . - Avoid sharing personal items and toiletries . These include drinking glasses , utensils , and toothbrushes . - Be aware of how you handle animals . Wash up after touching pet food or poop . Ask someone else to change your cat litter . Stay away from rodents , lizards , and turtles in general . If you keep them as pets , have someone look after them while you 're pregnant . - Practice safe sex . Limit your number of partners and make sure to use condoms . - Safeguard your food . Wash fruits and vegetables . Make sure that your meat , fish , and eggs are well cooked , and your work surfaces are kept clean . Do n't eat certain foods that may make you ill , including raw cheeses and rare meat . - Stay away from anyone with a contagious disease . Of course , it 's easier said than done if you work together or share a living space , but do the best you can . Always follow your local COVID - 19 guidelines , too . - Travel smart . Speak with a healthcare provider before you head overseas . Skip places where infections could endanger you or your baby . If you must go , take the appropriate precautions . Protect yourself from mosquitos , wherever you 're . - Get vaccinated . If you 're pregnant or trying to get pregnant , check to see that you 're current on your immunizations . You can receive certain shots during pregnancy , but not all of them . Finally , if you 're sick or think you 've been exposed to a contagious disease , let your caregiver know right away . That way , you can be tested and treated if necessary ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Nine bodies wrapped in red-and - black Albanian national flags were lying in front of a makeshift stage . Only fifty yards away , there were nine freshly dug graves . The funeral was originally scheduled for one o'clock in the afternoon , but commenced in the early evening hours because police had erected barricades on all roads to Drenica . They tried to prevent people coming from all over Kosovo to attend the funeral . Rows of cars and buses at the Komorani checkpoint near Glogovac stretched for miles . Ten members of the Ahmeti family from Likosani and their neighbors had a good reason to be at the funeral : they had been dead for three days already . Their bodies were taken that morning from the Pristina morgue but the truck carrying them reached the village only late that afternoon , as the driver was forced to take almost impassable side - roads the police could n't barricade . When the bodies finally arrived , it turned out that the death toll was bigger than expected so three more graves had to be dug . A total of 24 persons , mainly peasants from Likosani and the nearby village Chirez , were buried that day . The four policemen and an ethnic Albanian buried the day before bring the total death toll of the bloody weekend in Drenica to 29 . The obviously exaggerated reports by both the Serb and the Albanian side , as well as controversial testimonies of eyewitnesses still in a state of shock , made it no easier to establish what exactly happened between Friday , when the clashes broke out , and Sunday , when police finally left Drenica . It is certain , however , that Kosovo has not seen so much bloodshed since 28 March 1989 , when 70 people were killed in riots following a government decision that effectively took away Kosovo 's autonomy . A protest rally by ethnic Albanians in Pristina following the Drenica bloodshed ended with a brutal police intervention in which 30 protesters were wounded and one was killed , allegedly with a shot in the mouth . The situation in the province is tense , there is no telling what could happen next . Ethnic Albanian political leaders , including the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo leader Ibrahim Rugova and head of the Parliamentary party Adem Demaci , have girded together and convened for days in an effort to take a common stand on the massacre . At the time this edition of Vreme was being put in circulation , it was still too early to predict how they might react to the aggravated situation in the province . Meanwhile , the Serbian media and the vast majority of both government and opposition leaders took turns in congratulating the police with some exaltation for \u201c dealing a decisive blow to the terrorists \u201d . Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic went out of his way to express his personal condolence to the families of the killed policemen , and duly praised the police for their \u201c courage , patriotism and commitment \u201d . The Commander of the special police troops , Miroslav Mijanovic , called the four killed policemen \u201c the knights of Kosovo slued by ethnic Albanian bandits \u201d , while the ethnic Albanians said the friends and relatives they buried in Likosane were \u201c martyrs and heroes , the innocent victims of Serbian terror \u201d . It appears that neither side is prepared to treat one another as human beings . The police version : The Serbian interior ministry released a statement to the effect that it all started on Saturday around half past noon , when a police unit allegedly on a routine patrolling assignment was ambushed near Likosane . The car ran into a ditch , and the officers in trouble requested back up . Another police vehicle with four officers in it was sent to rescue them , but they too were ambushed several miles down the road . That is when two officers were killed from automatic weapons , while another two were seriously wounded and taken to hospital . Around two o'clock in the afternoon , another back up unit was sent and \u201c engaged in battle against the terrorists , in full accord with the powers vested in the police \u201d . Clashes between the police and the self - styled Kosovo Liberation Army ( UCK ) , which claimed responsibility for the death of four Serbian policemen , went on all night and spilled into the nearby villages . By Sunday , when the fighting stopped , two more police officers were killed and another two were wounded , while the death toll on the other side rose to 15 . The Serbian interior ministry did n't bother to disclose the names of the killed \u201c terrorists \u201d nor the nine allegedly arrested , leaving that to the ethnic Albanian side . There are lots of facts indicating that the Interior Ministry statement is only partially true . There had been no routine patrol assignments in the central Kosovo region of Drenica and its border municipalities Glogovac , Mitrovica and Klina since last November , when the UCK effectively took control of the region . Several minor skirmishes occurred , and they all ended with police withdrawal . Since then , police going on business to Drenica have been backed up by helicopter and armored vehicles . It is therefore hard to imagine that the police unit ambushed on Saturday was on a routine mission . Most of the killed Albanians ( the death toll does not match police reports ) , were no terrorists . According to eyewitness reports from Drenica , clashes between police and the UCK broke out on Friday evening , a whole day prior to what the police said . According to eyewitnesses , the fighting broke out in Srbica , the largest village in the Drenica region , and not in Likosane . The fighting broke out when unidentified individuals drove by a primary school accommodating Serb refugees and fired at the building with automatic weapons . Police reacted instantly and started pursuing the assailants , who stopped their vehicle in a chicane near Likosani and opened fire at their pursuants . The police vehicle slid off the road into the ditch , and it seems that two police officers were killed in this shootout . The back up unit that consequently arrived could not make any progress at night . During the night and the following morning , both sides deployed reinforcements and prepared for battle . Full - scale clashes broke out when the police arrived with some 30 armored vehicles and two Gama assault choppers . The UCK fighters tried to repel the vastly superior enemy but had to withdraw and leave the inhabitants of Likosani and Chirez at the mercy of the police , who stormed into the villages and started searching the houses . It appears that someone fired at the police during the search , and that is when the massacre began . Brains in the grass : Those who somehow managed to reach Likosane and Chirez on Monday came across a sickening sight : in the bullet riddled houses lay the dead , surrounded by their family members in a deep state of shock . Four brothers of the Djelji family \u2013 Bechir , Nazmi , Bedri and Bekim were killed in their Chirez home . Muhamet Dzleja , 79 , his brother Naser and cousin Kadrid were apparently shot from close range , the photographs clearly showing gunpowder marks around the wounds . Dzemsir Nabihu and his pregnant wife Rukija had their heads blown off . Virtually all the victims were killed in their homes or just outside them . Some houses were hit by artillery , but reports that they had been torched and demolished fortunately turned out to be devoid of all truth . The worst fate befell the Ahmeti family of Likosani , the wealthiest in the village , as almost all its members were executed . Mirsije Ahmeti , 24 , who lost her father and three brothers , told Vreme that police stormed into their estate breaking through the gate with an armored vehicle at around four o'clock in the afternoon . \u201c My father shouted out that the door was open , but they shattered the windows and pointed their rifles at us . They told us to lie down on our fronts , put our hands behind our heads and locked us up in a small room . They took all the men out while we stayed locked until they left , \u201d Mirsije told Vreme 's reporter . When she and the other women got out , their men were nowhere to be seen . Traces of blood on the rocks near a bush led them to outside their estate , where the neighbors found bullet shells , dry blood on the ground , pieces of clothes , human bones and an entire human brain on a patch of grass . They sealed the area with a rope and let Vreme 's reporter take a look for himself . Ten dead members of the Ahmeti family between the age of 16 and 60 were delivered on Tuesday in the truck mentioned earlier . An individual who saw the bodies in the Pristina morgue said they looked \u201c pretty chewed up \u201d . \u201c They were alive when they left \u201d , Mirsije said in tears . Her cousin Dzevdet Ahmeti , 30 , who happened to be in Pristina over the weekend and fortunately avoided the fate of his relatives , said the police robbed their home of about 5,000 German marks ' worth of gold and foreign currency , ten kilos of meat and 200 eggs . They also took a satellite dish receiver and a car radio . \u201c I do n't understand these people \u201d , Dzevdet said with a strange calm in his voice . After they were done with the Ahmeti family , they moved into a neighboring house thinking it was abandoned . They were wrong , for 17 year old Nait N. ( the name has been changed for obvious reasons ) was hiding in the attic . \u201c I did n't see anything but I heard it all . I heard blows and screams outside the Ahmeti estate . Then I heard gun shots and the screams stopped \u201d , Nait said . He spent 27 hours in the attic , too afraid to move . The house he was hiding in was used by the police as a canteen in which they prepared food they took from the Ahmeti home . They ate , drank and sang all night . One climbed into the attic and peeped in , but he did n't see me . I was paralyzed with fear \u201d , Nait said . The Likosani villagers say that not a single member of the Ahmeti family was a terrorist . \u201c They were the only wealthy family in the village . They worked hard for their money , minded their own business and had good relations with everyone \u201d , one of the villagers said . Why were they killed then ? The villagers said the police saw someone run into the Ahmeti backyard , while a police source said the following : \u201c They shot at us from each and every house in the village . Our boys went wild . No one in the village would have survived if it were n't for orders from Belgrade to stop . \u201d Say hello to Gelbard : The ethnic Albanians of Likosani and Chirez believe there would have been far more casualties if it were n't for the UCK , whose reputation seems to have remained unstained after the latest events . \u201c They would have killed us all had there been no one to defend us \u201d , a villager said , and then answered our \u201c naive \u201d request for information on the whereabouts of the UCK and whether they would be willing to talk . \u201c Who do you think the UCK are and where do you think they came from ? Look around you , everything you see is the UCK \u201d , he said . The efforts by the Serbian regime to label the Likosani and Chirez victims as terrorists who got what they asked for will probably fail . \u201c Anti-terrorism , the way its done in the ' civilized world ' , does n't mean that suspects have no rights and that they should be shot on sight . We also have a problem with terrorism , but we apprehend our terrorists and give them a fair trial \u201d , a western diplomat said . \u201c Milosevic will have to bear the consequences of this action , but the immediate problem is that the western allies ca n't back their words by decisive action at the moment . The threat to bring back the sanctions is simply not enough \u201d , he added . The West , after all , should not feel completely innocent in this bloody drama . The Drenica incident occurred only days after US diplomat Robert Gelbard sharply condemned the UCK as a terrorist organization . Ethnic Albanian leaders feel this was tantamount to giving Milosevic the green light to order an onslaught , while many ethnic Albanians now tell western diplomats and reporters to \u201c give Gelbard their regards \u201d . The US administration now has to explain that encouraging Milosevic was not their intention . What happened last weekend will only widen the rift within the international community . Some of America 's European allies , not too fond of what they call US bulldozer diplomacy in the Balkans , are actually quite delighted that the US is now tangled up in the Kosovo mess , and they will most certainly look for a way to capitalize on any Washington error . There is a lot of evidence to suggest that the Drenica massacre was in fact a result of a cynical strategy . Serbian president Milan Milutinovic 's optimistic statements about the education agreement and the forthcoming visits of western diplomats to Belgrade could be a prelude to a \u201c Lex Specialis \u201d for Kosovo . Too bad there was no one to explain this to the dwellers of Likosani and Chirez , for they might have decided to spend the weekend somewhere else ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

At the center of this city is Christ , the Lamb of God . Rivers flow from the city , and on the banks spring up trees , covered in fruit , full of life .

The Client Woolworths Limited is a major publicly listed trans - Tasman retail group , with more than 3,000 stores and 180,000 employees in New Zealand and Australia . Through its New Zealand business , Progressive Enterprises Limited , it is a significant player in the New Zealand grocery market . The Challenge A key business improvement focus for Woolworths over the past few years has been enhancing the integration of its own core IT systems with those of its Trade Partners , through Electronic Data Interchange ( EDI ) . It has also been deploying a web-based e-business portal called webforms . Webforms is a free online solution allowing Woolworths ' Trade Partners to receive Purchase Orders and then respond with purchase - order acknowledgments and electronic Invoices . The application has been introduced as an alternative to fax and email , allowing the company 's Trade Partners who may not be in a position to implement a full EDI process , to still access the benefits of electronic trading . In a bid to speed up Trade Partner uptake of these electronic trading options in New Zealand , Woolworths engaged B2BE , one of its Value - Added Network ( VAN ) providers with a New Zealand base , to undertake a 13 - week education project . This involved liaising with 943 of Woolworths ' New Zealand Trade Partners , to educate , encourage and assist as many of them as possible to make an early transition to webforms or EDI . Prior to the webforms / EDI engagement project , B2BE had a strong existing relationship with Woolworths and its New Zealand operation , Progressive , facilitating the connections for many of those Trade Partners already engaging in e-business with Progressive . This put B2BE in a good position to help Woolworths in its goals around uptake of e-business by its New Zealand Trade Partners . The Solution B2BE ran a campaign for Woolworths that involved contacting each Trade Partner several times . Initially B2BE tested the community 's preparedness for the changes using an online survey . Then , depending on responses , B2BE followed up via phone and email to all Trade Partners , directing them to a purpose - built B2BE web site . The site provided all the documentation Trade Partners needed along with a registration process . The registrations from the site were also integrated with the Woolworths TRM ( Trade Relationship Management ) system . Jason Steiner , Woolworths ' Senior Project Manager for e-business , says the key reason for engaging B2BE was the realisation that to get the most out of the project it would be best to use an organisation with strong e-business supplier engagement skills , with \u201c on - the - ground \u201d presence in New Zealand and expertise in Woolworths ' e-business solutions , as well as in VAN services in general . \u201c B2BE already had contact with the majority of our Trading Partners who were already connected with Progressive electronically . In addition , they had experience in previous e-business initiatives undertaken by Woolworths in the past , \u201d says Steiner . \u201c One of the challenges we faced was contacting the right person to liaise with on e-business issues within each Trade Partner organisation . This was an issue from a resourcing point of view if we were to do it in - house . We could have got on the phone and started contacting each organisations , but we realised it was more efficient and cost-effective to engage B2BE who could not only establish contact in the context of e-business but also provide expertise and guidance as a VAN should it be necessary \u201d says Steiner . \u201c We looked to employ expertise in a geography that 's in a different time - zone to our Australian headquarters , and where we do n't have our own significant in - house e-business expertise or resources to undertake such a task . \u201d He says Woolworths ' New Zealand Trade Partners vary significantly in the size of their businesses , and the IT and technical skills they have within their organisations . \u201c B2BE were in the ideal position to assist us , given they have a presence on the ground in New Zealand and could also add value , technically , to discussions with our Trade Partners about whether to go down the webforms or EDI route . \u201d The Result By the end of B2BE 's 13 - week campaign contacting and liaising with Woolworths ' 943 New Zealand Trade Partners , 361 had signed up to use the webforms platform and 67 others had opted to engage through EDI . More than 100 others had indicated their interest and intention to move to either webforms or EDI in the near future . This meant the result of the campaign was that of Woolworths ' potential e-business base , 48 per cent had signed up to the initiative within the campaign 's agreed time - frame , and 12 per cent were expected to do so in the very near future . \u201c When you look at the number of trading relationships transitioned to e-business from start to finish , I think it was an impressive outcome , \u201d says Steiner . \u201c We 're very happy with the results achieved . I do not think we would have been able to achieve the same result utilising our own resources alone . We definitely achieved what we set out to do . \u201d Further insights gained by B2BE into the e-business capabilities and preferences of the Woolworths ' Trade Partner base , during the course of the project , will enable Woolworths to progress most efficiently and effectively those yet to make an e-business transition , Steiner adds . \u201c We 've gathered key information to assist with this and future eBusiness initiatives , such as who the right contact is for e-business within the various Trade Partner organisations . Thus , we 're now well positioned for any follow - ups with those yet to sign - on . In addition , we are now able to conduct a discussion with the Trade Partner already aware of our e-business aspirations . \u201d One New Zealand - based Woolworths Trade Partner to sign up for webforms , as a result of the B2BE project , is organics products ' distributor Ceres Enterprises . Ceres distributes its range of dry goods through Progressive Enterprises ' supermarkets , typically supplying each store with between 200 and 300 lines of product . Ceres ' General Manager , David Josephson , says his company had previously been interacting with Progressive via email . \u201c Facilitating the changeover to e-business trading with Progressive was probably going to be out of our league without somebody like B2BE having the expertise to handle things as the go-between , \u201d Josephson says . \u201c Even though we had dabbled in the EDI side of things , to try and get e-business up and running , and to , eventually , consider moving towards a full EDI connection with Progressive , we needed somebody like B2BE to come in and assist us , \u201d he says . \u201d We have n't actually gone live with webforms yet , so have n't seen the benefits from that side . But we have definitely seen the benefits of working with B2BE . It 's certainly a lot easier dealing with somebody locally than it is trying to deal directly with a company based in Australia . \u201d And Josephson is also anticipating that significant benefits will flow through to Ceres ' operation when the company does go live with webforms in the near future . \u201c We get hundreds , if not thousands , of order lines through on a weekly basis which we currently have to manually key - in , so moving to an e-business platform will assist our operation greatly . \u201d For more information regarding Progressive , please visit www.progressive.co.nz or to find out more about B2BE and how they can help your organisation to reduce manual document processing and distribution visit www.b2be.com or contact B2BE"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

From the team 's founding by Conn Smythe , through Harold Ballard and his Carlton St. Cashbox , to the Ontario Teachers ' Pension Plan , the history of the Leafs could be a course in how to make money by buying low and selling high . The once near- bankrupt franchise is the most valuable hockey team in the world and the cornerstone of a company worth well over a billion dollars . Consider the case of Charlie Querie . In 1927 , he had a chance to sell his money -losing Toronto St. Patricks to a consortium in Philadelphia for $ 200,000 , but was convinced by J.P. Bickell , one of his shareholders , that a hockey team was a matter of civic pride and it could n't leave town . Querie was talked into selling the team for less \u2014 $ 160,000 \u2014 to a consortium led by Conn Smythe . The World War I veteran changed the colours to blue and white from green and white , and the name of the team to the Maple Leafs , after the Maple Leaf Regiment . The team was n't much on the ice , but the owners kept busy off it . Smythe and Co. managed to buy a plot of land from the T. Eaton Co. Ltd. \u2014 at $ 150,000 below market price \u2014 and construction began on the $ 1.5 million Maple Leaf Gardens . Construction was partly funded through a public offering of preferred shares in Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. at $ 10 each . Bickell \u2014 remember him ? \u2014 held on to his shares and became first president of Maple Leaf Gardens . From 1931 on , the Leafs made the Stanley Cup finals seven times in a nine - year span , but only won the trophy the first time . On Nov. 12 , 1931 , the Gardens opened . The Leafs lost 2 - 1 to the Chicago Blackhawks before an opening night crowd of 13,542 . They won the Stanley Cup that year and the Carlton St. Cashbox was born . Smythe held on to it until 1961 . That 's when he realized a tidy profit by selling nearly all his shares in Maple Leaf Gardens for $ 2.3 million to a partnership made up of his son Stafford Smythe , newspaper baron John Bassett and Toronto Marlboros president Harold Ballard . A decade later , Bassett sold his shares to Stafford Smythe and Ballard . In October 1971 , Smythe died . The next year all Smythe 's shares were purchased by Ballard . That left him with majority ownership of both the building and the Leafs . This was the darkest era for Leaf fans . The penny-pinching Ballard oversaw some of the team 's worst seasons and drove away its biggest names , like Dave Keon and Darryl Sittler . Wendel Clark kept the fans coming through the 1980s , a fan favourite who played on terrible teams . But the team was still making money and was still valuable . Ballard 's death on April 11 , 1990 laid the foundation for the future of the franchise . One of his executors , Steve Stavro , paid off a $ 20 million loan that Molson had been made to Ballard in 1980 . In return , Stavro was given an option to buy Gardens shares from Ballard 's estate . Molson sold its stake to Stavro in 1994 . The ownership of the team was unstable in the early 1990s . Curiously , on the ice the team performed better than it had in decades , with Doug Gilmour leading the Leafs deep into the playoffs in back - to - back seasons . Stavro and his partners \u2014 the TD Bank and the Ontario Teachers ' Pension Plan \u2014 eventually bought Ballard 's shares from the estate for $ 34 a share or $ 75 million in a controversial takeover . Stavro and his partners in MLG Ventures became the new owner of the Leafs and Maple Leaf Gardens . However , the courts later forced Stavro 's group to pay $ 23.5 million to charities listed as Ballard 's beneficiaries after a trial determined the charities had been shortchanged . In 1996 , Larry Tanenbaum bought a stake in MLG Ventures . The team missed the playoffs that year and the next . In 1998 , MLG Ventures took Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. private by buying out all minority shareholders . The two corporations amalgamated , becoming Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd . In February , MLG Ventures bought the Toronto Raptors and the $ 175 million Air Canada Centre , then under construction . Again the franchise , some say , got the land at below- market rates . A winner , however , has yet to develop . The Leafs have not made the playoffs since 2003 . The team has n't won a Stanley Cup since 1967 ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

( F ) , founded in 1919 by Henry Ford , is a leader in the global automotive industry . Ford designs , manufactures , sells , and services a full line of cars , trucks , and utility vehicles . The company also offers a broad range of financial services to support car dealers and vehicle sales . The company currently is focused on boosting electric car production , mobility services , and self-driving technology . Ford has operations worldwide and employs about 186,000 people globally . Ford 's competitors include established automobile companies such as General Motors Co. ( GM ) and Japan - based Toyota Motor Corp . ( TM ) as well as newer entrants such as electric vehicle makers Tesla Inc. ( TSLA ) and China - based NIO Inc. ( NIO ) . Key Takeaways - Ford is an automotive company that sells cars , trucks , and sports utility vehicles . It also provides vehicle service and financing . - The vast majority of the company 's revenue comes from automotive sales . - Mobility is the smallest operating segment by revenue , but also the fastest-growing . - Ford Credit was the only operating segment to report positive earnings for the most recent quarter , as measured by earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) . - Ford announced in September 2021 a total of $ 11.4 - billion in investments in two U.S. sites that will focus on electric vehicle ( EV ) production and batteries . Ford 's Financials Ford 's most recent earnings report was for Q2 2021 , ended June 30 , 2021 . The company posted net income of $ 553 million , down substantially from net income of $ 1.1 billion for the prior- year quarter . Despite that , Ford reported company - wide adjusted earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) of $ 1.1 billion in Q2 2021 compared to adjusted EBIT of - $ 1.9 billion in the same quarter a year earlier . The company 's total revenue for Q2 2021 was $ 26.8 billion , up 38.1 % year - over - year ( YOY ) as sales began to recover from the major disruptions to the economy caused by the COVID - 19 pandemic beginning in early 2020 . Throughout the pandemic , Ford 's business has been negatively affected by production suspensions and the global semiconductor supply shortage . After suspending production at facilities around the world in March 2020 , Ford returned to normal production schedules in June of that year . Ford 's Business Segments Ford operates through three business segments : Automotive , Mobility , and Ford Credit . The company breaks out revenue and adjusted EBIT for each segment . EBIT is a measure of profitability calculated as revenue minus expenses excluding tax and interest . Additionally , Ford reports corporate governance expenses , interest income , and gains and losses from investments under a fourth category , Corporate Other , although this is not considered an operating segment . Automotive Ford earns the vast majority of its revenue by selling vehicles , service parts , and accessories around the world under the Ford and Lincoln brands . The automotive segment includes revenues and costs related to development , manufacture , distribution , service , and electrification vehicle programs . It also sells vehicles wholesale to dealers and distributors in five major geographical segments : North America , South America , Europe , China ( including Taiwan ) , and International Markets Group . With Q2 2021 revenues of $ 24.1 billion , Ford 's Automotive segment accounted for 90.2 % of revenues for Q2 2021 . Automotive revenues grew by 45.1 % YOY in that quarter , the second - fastest rate among Ford 's three operating segments . However , the Automotive segment reported a loss for Q2 2021 , measured by adjusted EBIT , of - $ 95 million . That was a dramatic improvement from - $ 2.1 billion EBIT in the same quarter a year earlier . For Q2 2021 , Ford 's adjusted EBIT for its Automotive business in North America and International Markets Group were each positive , while its adjusted EBIT for the Automotive operations in South America , Europe , and China were all negative . Combined , Automotive adjusted EBIT for South America , Europe , and China totaled - $ 493 million for the quarter . Mobility Ford 's Mobility segment includes development costs for the development and production of autonomous vehicles . It also includes Ford 's equity ownership of Argo AI , a developer of autonomous driving systems , and investments in Spin , a micro-mobility service provider . Mobility is the smallest of Ford 's segments by revenue . It generated just $ 21 million of revenue for Q2 2021 , or about 0.1 % of total quarterly revenue . It was the fastest-growing segment by revenue , tripling YOY for that period , though that growth was off of an extremely small base . Mobility reported adjusted EBIT of - $ 182 million for Q2 2021 , an improvement from - $ 286 million in the same quarter a year earlier . Ford Credit The Ford Credit segment is comprised of the company 's vehicle - related financing and leasing operations . The company offers a variety of automotive financing products to and through dealers worldwide . Most of the Ford Credit business involves financing of vehicles , supporting dealer operations , and lease contracts . Ford Credit posted quarterly revenue of $ 2.6 billion for Q2 2021 , or roughly 9.7 % of total revenues . This figure was down by 5.0 % YOY , making Ford Credit the only one of the company 's operating segments to see declining revenues YOY for the quarter . Despite that , Ford Credit generated adjusted EBIT of $ 1.6 billion in Q2 2021 , nearly tripling YOY , as it benefited from the rebound in vehicle sales compared to a year earlier . It was the only operating segment to report positive adjusted EBIT in the quarter . During the quarter , Ford Credit benefited from an historically low loss-to -receivables ( LTR ) ratio , which reflects low losses and strong net recoveries . Ford Credit 's U.S. auction values also were 39 % higher than a year ago , reflecting robust demand for used cars . Ford 's Recent Developments Under the leadership of Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Jim Farley since fall of 2020 , Ford has heavily prioritized electric vehicles and related technologies . In May 2021 , the company announced that it aimed to be a leader in electric vehicles and connected services . Ford anticipates that 40 % of its global vehicle volume will be fully electric by 2030 and plans to spend more than $ 30 billion on electrification and battery development by 2025 . On Sept. 27 , 2021 , Ford announced a series of steps to increase its electric vehicle technology and production . Ford will create a 6 - square - mile campus in Tennessee to build the next generation of F-Series electric pickup trucks and advanced batteries . Ford also will build twin battery plants in Kentucky . The company plans to invest $ 11.4 billion in the two sites , creating about 11,000 new jobs . Also in September , the company announced a partnership with retail giant Walmart Inc. ( WMT ) and Argo AI to launch an autonomous vehicle delivery service in select markets in the U.S. The service aims to use Ford self - driving vehicles to deliver Walmart orders to customers . This launch is an early effort in what Ford describes as \" large - scale autonomous vehicle operations across a broad footprint of U.S. cities . \""}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Sitting alone , Henry Voong and his son Jiverly Wong , were having a conversation outside their home on Baker Street in Johnson City . Sprinkled into their father - son conversation was terror from the mouth of a 22 - year - old man . Wong told his father someone was trying to kill him . \" They 're in front of me and trying to capture me , \" Wong told his father , pointing to the empty air before them . Voong quickly realized his son was not joking and decided to take him to the hospital . Wong went willingly to escape his supposed captors . The family of six had been in the United States for about five months and only Henry Voong spoke English , broken at best . Voong said he realizes now that communicating with the doctors was unclear . After two hours , the doctors told Voong there was nothing wrong with his son and they sent him home . Nineteen years later , Voong and his wife wonder if the incident was a sign .

That incident 19 years ago is the only time they witnessed such erratic behavior or sought treatment for him . Wong 's paranoia did not surface publicly again until April 6 , when a letter written by Wong arrived at News 10 Now in Syracuse . The letter came three days after Wong opened fire at the American Civic Association in Binghamton , killing 13 people and then himself . Wong wrote how undercover police officers taunted him , tortured him and spread rumors about him wherever he went . Voong said he has never seen any officers calling or visiting his son . Why Wong did what he did remains a mystery , especially to the people who lived with him for nearly the last two years . His parents say he did not have any friends and rarely spoke to anyone . To them , he lived a quiet , nearly silent existence for the last 19 years . According to his father , that silence deepened two weeks before the shooting . Wong stopped eating dinner , stopped watching television and rarely emerged from behind his bedroom door . The letter Wong sent to News 10 Now was dated March 18 , a little more than two weeks before the shooting . \" He avoided being in the house at the same time with me , \" Voong said . \" At first , I thought maybe he was mad about something and was planning to ask him . This tragedy occurred before I even had a chance to ask him . \" Voong and Thong are trying to piece together the last few weeks -- even the last few years -- to find an answer to the question so many have : why ? \" All parents raise their children to be good human beings , \" Voong said . \" You never imagine in your wildest dreams that they would end up doing something so horrific . \" The couple contacted The Post-Standard on Thursday because they wanted to apologize to the Binghamton community and all those affected by their son 's actions . \" We are deeply sorry for our son 's actions , \" Voong said . \" Our family sincerely apologize to the victims ' families and ask for their forgiveness . \" The early days The Voong family moved to Binghamton from Vietnam in June 1990 . While ethnically Chinese , the Voongs said they left Saigon with the help of a program that assisted former South Vietnamese soldiers and political prisoners who were jailed after the Vietnam War ended . Voong served as a captain in the South Vietnamese Army . In the early 1990s , Voong said , his wife and their four children spent a lot of time together . Wong , the second oldest , would have been about 22 years old and spoke little to no English when the family moved to the Binghamton area . His parents say he often joked with his siblings during those early days . The family shared meals and often watched television together . \" We always stuck together because we were afraid we might get lost in our new surroundings , \" Voong said . Many members of the Vietnamese community in Binghamton fondly recall Voong during that time . Diep Nguyen says Voong helped many new immigrants by translating and taking them to school or a doctor appointment . \" The Voongs are a good family and always willing to help others , \" Nguyen said . \" Their son ( Wong ) kept to himself and rarely interacted with the Vietnamese community . \" About a year after settling in the states , Wong moved out of his parents ' home into a nearby apartment by himself . He worked at Felchar Manufacturer in Binghamton , a company that makes electric motors and power cords . Less than a year after that , Wong moved to California . In many ways Voong and Thong say , that was the last time they saw their son . A new name in California Binghamton police say Wong became an American citizen in November 1995 and left the country shortly after . Wong 's passport records , according to Binghamton police , say he returned to Los Angeles on Dec. 25 , 1999 , from Tokyo . Police say he was married and divorced in California but they have not disclosed the woman 's name has not been reported . Wong 's parents say they have no idea if any of that information is true . \" I do n't know anything about his life in California , \" Voong said . \" Something must of have happened there . \" During the nearly 15 years he spent in California , Wong rarely kept in touch with his family . He never visited or sent letters . His phone calls were few and short and he refused to share a mailing address . Mail addressed to their son occassionally arrived at the family 's Binghamton home . Voong recalls opening a piece addressed to Jiverly Wong , which was different from his son 's given name of Linh Phat Voong . \" He must have changed his name after he got his citizenship , \" Voong said . \" I was very angry because it 's our family name . He ca n't just change our family name . \" Back to the Southern Tier After years of nearly total silence , Jiverly Wong called his father in 2007 and told him he had lost his job as a truck driver in California . He asked his father if he could come home . Voong said he was upset about not hearing from his son for so long , but welcomed him home . Voong said the man who arrived at their house nearly two years ago , was not the same person who left 15 years earlier . He soon got a job working the 3 - to - midnight shift at the Shop-Vac plant in Endicott . Voong said he and his wife and their daughter Milline rarely saw or interacted with Wong , especially since everyone worked different shifts . Wong was more quiet . He did n't have any friends and he did n't make or receive any telephone calls . He never wore short sleeves , even in the summer . He spent most of his time in his bedroom , but did n't make much noise . He always emerged from the bathroom after a shower fully clothed in long sleeves and pants . Voong said his son kept to himself and spent most of his free time out of the house . About a year ago , Voong said Wong slapped his youngest sister Milline , 35 , who also lives with them , across the face during an argument . He said he did n't know what the argument was about but it was the only time he can recall his son being physically abusive . The only other time Voong can recall his son having a temper was a time when Wong raised his voice to his father several months ago . Voong asked Wong to move a portable heater away from their leather couch . In a raised voice , Voong said , \" Dad , you 're just being difficult . \" Life after the layoff In November 2008 , Wong told his parents he had been laid off from Shop - Vac . While out of work , Wong told his parents he was going to take classes to improve his English at the American Civic Association . Whenever he left the house , Wong said he was going to the library to use the computer . He checked out movies about animals . Posters and calendars of owls , cats , dogs and birds hung in his room . \" He liked animals , \" Voong said . \" He had a fish bowl with a fish in it . He liked watching ' Animal Planet ' and other channels showing animals ... I never saw him watch anything else . \" Voong and Thong say they know little else of the man who lived down the hall for more than a year . Voong said he never saw his son with a handgun , knew he owned one or heard him talk about going to a shooting range . Voong said he knew that his son owned an air rifle , which is similar to a BB gun . He also said he had never seen the room or setting in the photos of Wong holding guns that were sent to News 10 Now . The day of the shooting About noon on April 3 , Voong said , he was at work when co-workers began talking about \" an Asian guy shooting on Front Street by the American Civic Association . \" Voong was worried . His son took classes at the center . At their home on Taylor Street in Johnson City , Thong said she was sleeping that Friday when a police officer knocked on their door about 11 a.m . The officer told Thong something about a car being parked at the American Civic Association but she could not understand much because she speaks very little English . She asked the officer to wait until her husband got home from work since his English is stronger . The officer waited at the house until Voong arrived home between 3 and 4 p.m . Voong said he was surprised to see several Binghamton police cars at his house and immediately believed something had happened to Wong at the center . Police brought Voong , Thong and their daughter to the police station for questioning . Police spoke with the family for nearly four hours without a translator . Shortly before wrapping up the interview at about 8 p.m. , police told Wong 's parents that their son had died . Vong says they never explained his role in the shooting . Upset by the news of their son 's death , Voong and Thong returned home but did not watch any news , which by nearly that time included the name of the alleged shooter : Jiverly Wong . Voong and Thong said they learned of their son 's role in the shooting by reading Saturday 's newspaper . \" We were horrified and we could n't believe it , \" Voong said . \" I never suspected that my son would be dead . I especially never thought he would be a killer . \" Even family members in Vietnam heard about the shooting and called the family . Wong 's 91 - year- old paternal grandmother cried and could n't believe her grandson 's actions , according to Voong . Moving forward For more than a week , reporters from across the country have set up shop on the family 's street , in their front yard and on their answering machine . Voong and Thong say they are living in a constant state of fear and devastation . They are afraid to go out in public and have not yet returned to their jobs in assembly work . They say they cannot eat and have a hard time sleeping through the night . They fear retaliation from the victims ' families or anyone in the community . To their surprise , Voong and Thong say they have received more than 50 cards and dozens of many cards and floral arrangements supporting them and offering their sympathy and food at their doorstep . They say they are surprised and feel grateful . \" I thank members of the community who have been so kind and understanding , \" Voong said . \" Still , I am very worried about possible retaliation from some folks . We 're just two old parents who had no control over their 41 - year - old son 's actions . We ask everyone to forgive us for having such a son . \" After their interview at The Post -Standard , Voong and Thong went to the International Sangha Bhiksu Buddist Temple on Park Street in Syracuse to pray for the victims and their son . Because of the severity of his injuries , the family chose to cremate Wong 's body . They plan to spread his ashes in the ocean , which they hope will \" free his soul . \" Voong and Thong say they want to continue to live in Binghamton , the city where they sought a future for themselves and their family . \" My goal upon arrival in the U.S. , is to bring my children here so they can have a better future , \" Voong said . \" With this tragedy , I am very saddened and still in disbelief . \""}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

The precise landscape may differ between France and the United States , for example , but common trends emerge regarding their use in science and academia . Certain disciplines , for instance , are more active on social networks than others . Which research fields benefit the most from scientific social networks , and why ? Which available tools are the most useful for scientific research ? The future evolution of such networks is uncertain , but the utility they offer to researchers is worth a second look . The following presents a view from France on the social networks currently available and their use among scientists . This article is part of our dossier on Scientific Social Networks and was translated from the French by Abby Tabor . Social networks allow us to extend the reach of our influence and to exchange with others , well beyond the few people making up our private circle and the colleagues that we cross paths with each day . This sphere of close contact can be extended to included even acquaintances that we see only rarely , due to the distance that separates us , for example . But social networks also put us in contact with all kinds of people that we would never have met by way of a common interest , a mutual friend , or anything else . Similarly , scientists generally work individually or within a small research team . But it is rare that the isolated work of a scientist is not part of a national or even international collaboration . In academic studies and scientific research , the benefit of social networks for bringing together scientists and institutions seems obvious , given their ability to extend our sphere of contact and exchange . However , until now , social media have been adopted by only a minority of scientists ; their systems of exchange , via specialist conferences or international publications , do not evolve readily . It seems that the benefits of social media vary according to the discipline . In social sciences , digital technologies have already modified practices , including the digitization of databases or the digital and cartographic analysis of data . Blogs and social networks , tools that are more than necessary in these disciplines , are expanding rapidly . Research Logs for Historians In an article for the blog Homo Numericus , Pierre Mounier , a professor at France 's School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences ( EHESS ) and associate director of the Center for Open Electronic Publishing at Revues.org , looks back at the symposium \u201c In the Web of Social Media : New Means of Communication and Publication for the Human and Social Sciences \u201d , held at the German Historical Institute of Paris . Pierre Mounier analyzes the use of social media by historians . Through his experience with hypotheses.org , an academic blogging platform , he shows that research logs allow historians both to structure their work \u2013 in this way , the research log is an integral part of the work of the researcher \u2013 and to communicate internally ( with colleagues ) as well as externally ( i.e. popularization ) . The log allows historians to share their literature review , comments on their readings , hypotheses , results \u2026via a flexible and personalized tool . They are , thus , free to use the log as they see fit . They do , however , take a risk in revealing all the steps of the research process : their drafts , reflections , and raw data . Social Networks for Environmental Sciences The journal VertigO , a French -language electronic journal of environmental sciences , in open access , conducted a poll on scientific social networks from November 2009 to January 2010 . 159 French speakers and 23 English speakers responded to questions about what they expected from scientific social networks and their opinion of existing networks . The vast majority of respondents were in the field of environmental sciences , due simply to the mailing lists used for the diffusion of the poll . This preliminary study showed that the principal uses of a social network in the scientific world are collaborations and information searches . In addition , although the survey respondents seemed unconvinced by the networks currently available , they expressed interest in joining an open , multidisciplinary professional social network , involving many different participants . And , in spite of having little time to devote to it , respondents stated that they would be ready to contribute to the content of such a network and to share information . In exchange , they expected an active network , led by dynamic community managers , providing quality content . Social Media by Discipline and by Academic Field There are already several networks for social sciences ( SAGE , hypotheses.org ) offering a variety of tools : research logs , discussion forums , blogs , resources , event calendars , sharing of documents and the literature review \u2026 Information and communication sciences also bring together numerous social media players , as do the fields of scientific and technical culture ( Knowtex ) and science and art ( Bamboo , Artscience Factory , ArtScience Labs . ) In these disciplines , the interest of social media is acknowledged and these tools have been widely adopted . For the so- called hard sciences , similar networks have already become established in the English -speaking research world ( Research Gate , colwiz , Academia.edu ) , albeit with a limited reach . In France , while some initiatives have recently emerged , it seems that the hard sciences do not view social media with the same interest as social or communication sciences . Very specialized media , like the bibliographic tools Mendeley and Zotero , have seen the greatest success , their interest being , above all , individual and , only secondarily , collective . Aggregators of scientific blogs are also successful ( C@f\u00e9 des sciences in French , ScienceBlogging , ResearchBlogging , Science Blogs , and others in English ) , but it seems that the demand among readers for such blogs is greater than scientists ' need to maintain them . Universities ' own social networks have appeared in recent years ( Carnets 2 at the University of Paris Descartes ) . Even if these networks are supported by universities , and instructors and researchers remain their most sought after participants , it is the students , recent graduates and young researchers , for the most part , who bring them to life . The social tools used on these university networks are also different from those used in research ( for example , e-learning ) . In conclusion , social and communication tools have not been adopted in the same way by all scientific fields . Certain tools ( blogs , research logs , bibliographic tools \u2026 ) appear to have greater success than others ( e.g. forums ) . But , although a majority of scientists are in favor of scientific and professional social networks , they may still view them as too time consuming . Several initiatives are currently in development in the world of research , but it is not yet clear whether they will be adopted to varying degrees by different groups , or if a network will emerge in a way common to all scientific disciplines .

Chol 's viral YouTube hit , ' Take U to Da Movies ' featured on The Tonight Show 's ' Do Not Play ' segment and was mocked by host and narrator Steve Higgins . The track fuelled global discussion , but why ? Was Fallon simply making fun of a Sudanese migrant for poorly mirroring US culture ? Or is it possible Ur Boy is at the beginning of the next movement in art history ? ' Take U to Da Movies ' went viral in 2009 , and like many other YouTube hits it briefly pushed its creator into the public eye . The video launched a kind of fad music career for Chol , with the rapper even performing at the 2010 Melbourne Big Day Out . The track is confusing from an artistic standpoint , as it parodies US gangsta rap culture while looking like a serious attempt at creating rap music . ' Take U to Da Movies ' upholds the egocentric rap aesthetic , yet the subject ( Ur Boy taking a girl to the movies , paying for the popcorn and so on ) is endearing and oddly polite . The lyricism along with the absurdity of the video ( Bangs performs in front of green-screened JPEG images of city skylines , expensive cars , Australian cash and so on ) could be the reason for its traction online . However , it is difficult to discern exactly what factors are pushing the clip repeatedly into the limelight . Most of Chol 's other music videos appear to be less outwardly ironic . For example , ' Better Place ' is about the reputation of Sudanese people in Australia , and ' I 'm Going to the Ghetto ' examines Chol 's experience living in this country : Let me tell you the truth , but do n't get me wrong I 'm not happy in this country at all I want to go back to where I 'm from , which is my home I do n't know why I 'm here These tracks are more serious , though they share same raw production values as ' Take You to Da Movies . The Sudanese - Australian videographer Ez Eldin Deng shot many of them . The two met in 2004 at the Western English Language School in Braybrook , Victoria , and have been collaborating since . Like many other viral videos , the success of ' Take U to Da Movies ' had an accidental element . Deng explained , ' It was an experiment ; I wanted to work out how green screen [ also known as chroma key compositing , a post-production filmmaking technique ] worked , and Bangs had the idea for the images . I did n't know anything about YouTube . ' Deng felt the popularity of ' Take U to Da Movies ' was due to its simplicity . ' There is no technology where I come from and I wanted to do something simple , something people could relate to . Some people find it funny and some just try to work out how we did it . ' ' Take U to Da Movies ' appearing on The Tonight Show created something of media frenzy in Australia and online . In the days following , Chol released a response in the form of a diss track entitled , ' Ur Boy Bangz \u2013 Response to Jimmy Fallon \u2013 Do Not Watch ' . It is difficult to tell if Chol is actually offended or if it 's an elaborate joke at Fallon 's expense . Following the online release of the diss track , Chol then participated in a number of radio and television appearances , including interviews with ABC Radio National , Ten 's Studio 10 and SBS Radio . These appearances and countless online articles were supportive of the rapper 's encounter with The Tonight Show , though were also extremely patronising . The public reaction makes you wonder if this is just another example of humanity 's inherent cruelty when it comes rejoicing the perceived failure of others . And , for the record , the other side of the Fallon 's mean-spirited coin is the condescending praise given by so many media outlets ; ABC RN Drive 's Patricia Karvelas was kind to Chol , but at times it appeared as if she was talking to a child . The media reception is indicative of an outdated thinking on the way art is created \u2013 that is , if it does n't share the qualities of something known to be successful , critically or otherwise , then it is trivial and not worthy of respect . Are the reactions of Fallon and the media just an extension of angry white male syndrome , a kind of nostalgia for the past when everything made sense and a community understood why something was being discussed and shared around ? The truth is that it does n't matter if you think ' Take U to Da Movies ' is a good example of rap music or not . It does n't matter if it was intended as a parody or if it was meant to be serious ( or somehow both ) . There is no longer a point in discerning the intention of a creator in the post-postmodern world . What is important is working out why one music video speaks to a global audience and countless others fall through the cracks . It is not arbitrary . My guess is that what Ajak Chol and Ez Eldin Deng are doing resonated because it represents a new honesty in art , a realness that 's far from the egotistical laughter of a talk show host that modern culture is likely to leave behind . There are now audiences for artworks that would usually be rejected due to dated notions on what art is . An example is the art / music style , Vaporwave , which emerged early this decade . Vaporwave is characterised by a preoccupation with an 80s and 90s yuppie aesthetic . The music typically involves extensive sampling of lounge and muzak from the 1970s onwards . In a sarcastic video ' How To Make Vaporwave ' , YouTuber Frank Jav Cee describes the music as ' basically 80s elevator / infomercial music digitally slowed down with effects . ' Vaporwave appears almost exclusively on the internet and functions as both a critique and embrace of consumer capitalism . It epitomises post-irony and ambivalence in modern culture , and it rejects most of the technical standards of traditional and contemporary art . Irrespective of how this music is being formally reviewed , it has a wide , growing audience online \u2013 and like Ur Boy Bangs , it warrants acknowledgement of its being more than just a failed artistic attempt . ' In that moment , poetry will be made by everyone , and there will be emus in the zone , ' says Chris Marker in his complex video-essay , Sans Soleil . The film is pieced together from decades of travel videography , where each shot functions as a memory or an unconscious moment in time . Marker 's film was created in a way that appeared both intentional and accidental . ' Take U to Da Movies ' lacks the technical expertise of traditional and mainstream art ; however , it captures a vulnerability that 's almost impossible to recreate in traditional art forms . Like Sans Soleil , ' Take U to Da Movies ' achieved this both consciously and by mistake . The YouTube hit was , in the truest creative spirit , an experiment by two Sudanese - Australians to learn about new technology and online platforms . The idea of the trained and self - aware artist is being dismantled . The internet is ushering in a new age unrestricted by craft and fixed notions about what art is .

Mee ; Scenes by Charles Mee & Jessie Bear ; Choreography by Jonathan Matthews Produced by This Is Not A Theatre Company Off Off Broadway , Immersive Theatre Runs through 11.20.15 Undisclosed NYC apartment by Stephen Kaplan on 10.11.15 Jonathan Matthews with rubber ducks in Versailles 2015 . Photo by June Xie . BOTTOM LINE : Be a guest at a very exclusive invite - only party ( spanakopita and pretzels included ) . One of the great things about any immersive theatre experience is that it immediately throws you into a situation where your senses are heightened and every experience is suddenly called into question \u2014 is that part of the show ? Is that an actor ? Is that supposed to be happening ? This Is Not a Theatre Company 's ( TINATC ) new production , Versailles 2015 , does exactly this in a delightful and provocative manner . 24 hours prior to the performance , audience members are emailed the address to an apartment where we are to attend a party hosted by TINATC 's founder and co-artistic director Erin B. Mee ( played by Mee herself ) . It seems as if the party is an opportunity to view TINATC 's commission of a bathtub dance piece , also entitled Versailles 2015 , by choreographer - dancer Jonathan Matthews ( the incredibly agile , focused , goofy and death-defying \u2014 bathtubs are slippery , after all \u2014 Matthews , playing himself ) . Greeted in the lobby by Erin 's \u201c niece , \u201d Judy ( Caitlin Goldie ) , the rules of the party are explained \u2014 only a few party - goers at a time will be able to fit into her aunt 's bathroom to watch the dance piece , but there are some snacks and beverages to nosh on while we wait our turn ; shoes will be left at the door ( hospital fabric booties are provided for anyone who 'd like them ) ; and this is not Sleep No More , so please refrain from opening up any drawers or rifling through her aunt 's stuff . We are then brought up in an elevator and , after shedding our shoes , enter the apartment where the party is already in progress . It 's a huge credit to all involved how effective this first \u201c scene \u201d is . While some audience members may be gung - ho to jump into any type of experience , many may be resistant and nervous and , from the moment we enter , we are made to feel welcome and comfortable . Though I was fully aware of the artifice of the party , it genuinely felt like many NYC parties I 've attended and I found myself , as did the other audience members , relaxing into the situation and making the usual get-to -know - you small talk , unsure of whether or not I was talking to a genuine guest or an actor playing a guest . In fact , I actually was duped and had a lovely conversation with a guest that I did not realize until later was actually an actress in the piece . But the fact that this amused rather than annoyed me speaks directly to the ingratiating tone of the overall piece itself . As we wait to be brought into the bathroom , we are also masterfully spirited away and divided into smaller groups of 4 or 5 to witness additional moments in the other rooms of the apartment : a rant on the unifying powers of gourmet food ( in the kitchen ) ; a discussion about the history of the neighborhood where the apartment sits as well as the preponderance of plays set in living rooms ( knowingly and ironically taking place in the living room ) ; a saga of the near death of an English bulldog ( in the bedroom ) . Simultaneously , videographer Stefan Hartmann 's collected footage of global crises streams unobtrusively on a TV or i Pad screen casually left on in the various rooms . This juxtaposition of images of struggling refugees and angry demonstrations alongside the innocuous minutiae that the characters obsess over points to the overall theme of the evening ( as does the play 's and the performance - piece - within - the - play 's title , directly referencing the opulence of Louis XIV and a life of excess ) . But Charles Mee and Jessie Bear 's script does not go the obvious route of simply mocking these partygoers and their 1 % lives \u2014 we are meant to connect with them , for it is very recognizably our lives as well ( the play 's final argument is that anyone working in the arts or able to take the time to spend an evening seeing theatre is living a privileged life \u2026 and we are ) . The text runs a seamless line between the exquisite poetry and mind - numbing humdrumness of our often devastatingly mundane lives and is often so heavy - handed in its heavy - handedness that it lulls rather than grates . Ms. Mee 's cast of charming young actors appealingly rides this line beautifully . They effortlessly deliver the moments of heightened language while making it appear improvisational and natural . They all seem like people I know . It 's a credit to the direction and performances that as much as we may want to roll our eyes at their superficiality , we do n't . We smile and recognize them . They work seamlessly as an ensemble , even when performing solo in a kitchen or bathroom , and are so at ease in the contradiction of their roles as party - goers and actors that I half expected them to continue exiting with us as we descended back in the elevator and out into the lobby at the play 's end . The evening is best summed up by Goldie 's lovingly shallow Judy as she stares at her reflection in a mirror and reveals an aching depth , disclosing , \u201c If my world never gets bigger than this , than me sitting in this bathroom and plucking my eyebrows , that would be just fine , just a-ok with me , that would actually be perfection . Because I 'm a person right now , at this moment . I am a person sitting in a bathroom and that 's really , really all I want in the world . \u201d Amidst the countless atrocities that confront us every day , at our core we are all struggling to find the naked honesty in our own lives \u2014 the person staring back at us from our bathroom mirror and to be \u201c a- ok . \u201d Versailles 2015 allows us the time to contemplate this in its characters and in ourselves .

The committee members highlighted that Metro and Kawasaki \u2014 the manufacturer of the rail cars \u2014 have been aware of the wheel alignment issues that ultimately caused problems since 2017 , and had been working on ways to address the issue since then .

Metro pulled all 7000 - series trains in the wake of the incident , leading to a major reduction in service , as the newer rail cars represented a majority of the transit agency 's fleet . Older 2000 - and 3000 - series cars were returned to the system to help mitigate delays , but Metro admitted that normal service would not resume until the 7000 - series trains are able to return to the tracks . To that end , they submitted a plan to have the wheel assemblies tested regularly in order to detect any amount of shift between the axle and the wheels that could cause a derailment .

In each episode , the Hairies will taste that county 's ' signature dish ' . They visit local food producers and hunt for their ingredients before cooking the county 's traditional favourite on location in front of an audience of locals . The crowd are then invited to sample the food and pass their verdicts . The boys are then pushed outside their comfort zone as they face a cook - off against some of each county 's best chefs to create a unique dish using local produce that typifies the county . Not used to cooking in the kitchens of fine- dining restaurants , the Bikers need all the help they can get to find inspiration and source their ingredients . Dave says : \u201c We have gone head - to - head in cook - offs with some of the best and most respected chefs in the country , often Michelin-starred . Then we do a blind tasting for local food enthusiasts . It 's good fun and challenging \u2013 and when the victor is announced there are a few surprises ! \u201c What we 've found is that food in Britain is going bonkers . People are more concerned now with what they 're eating . To research each recipe , we set off and find two or three local food heroes : for example , there is a lady in Herefordshire who comes from generations of producers of berries used for Ribena . Now they are using the blackcurrants to make cassis which rivals the French . We also visited England 's leading escargot producer in Herefordshire and the finest Welsh charcuterie in Monmouthshire . In East Sussex we visit RidgeView vineyards with a sparkling wine to rival the best champagne in the world . \u201c We source salt marsh lamb , scallops from Rye , oysters from Colchester , mutton producers from Dumfries and Galloway , oats from a mill in Alford in Aberdeenshire , mussels in Anglesey . We see some stunning beef . Everyone loves steak and chips and native British beef is a true treasure we ca n't ignore . \u201d Si laughs : \u201c We have had some real food epiphanies : asparagus in Evesham , picked from the ground at the very start of the season and then cooked on a griddle with salt and pepper . Completely delicious . At Ormskirk in Lancashire we dug up new potatoes and cooked them there and then . Amazing . At Goosenaugh we saw corn- fed ducks and chickens , supplied to top chefs like the Roux Brothers and Marcus Wareing , all buying from a man in Lancashire . \u201d He continues : \u201c We 've spent two - and - a- half years going around the world investigating other people 's cultures . We wanted to get back to our roots and celebrate the food culture we have in Britain . It 's just as much an exploration of wonderment for us as it is for the viewers to discover all these local foods . There are some amazing cultural dishes in the UK that have been cooked for hundreds of years that have nearly been forgotten about . We want to revive those great old recipes . Have you heard of Shropshire 's fidget pie , for instance ? It 's based around gammon and cooking apples with potatoes , sage and onions . Delicious . We 've discovered lots of great dishes like that . \u201d David adds : \u201c In Cornwall , we made proper Cornish pasties at the Eden project ; we have made Malvern pudding , Cheshire cheese soup in the jaguar house at Chester Zoo ; Cullen Skink soup in Moray . In Scarborough we made my mum 's Yorkshire pudding with Si 's mam 's gravy ; in Wales we made Carmathenshire cockles , laver bread and Welsh salty bacon ; in Somerset we cooked Somerset chicken , a traditional dish heavy with apples . These are dishes born out of the land and generations of cooks perfecting the recipes . \u201d Simon hopes the series will give local producers a well deserved boost and convince shoppers there is good value to be found outside major supermarkets : \u201c It 's a simple equation . The more we buy from local producers , the more successful they will be . We need more market - places \u2013 and they can be in supermarkets \u2013 where artisan producers can sell . That 's how it should be , with your local supermarket selling local farmers ' meat , dairy produce , eggs and bread . And if the producer can produce more it will get cheaper . \u201d David adds : \u201c The British can and do produce some of the best products in the world . We hope that the series will be really inspirational for anyone remotely interested in food - let 's get out there and feast ! \u201d Si concludes : \u201c British people really know and care about their food , there is a real pride and many regional treasures to uncover . We 've had great craic , great food , fabulous locations and found great roads for riding motorbikes . By the end of the series we will have ridden 15,000 miles on our motorbikes \u2013 a proper food tour of Britain . \u201d The Hairy Bikers ' Food Tour of Britain has been made by Cactus TV ( Saturday Kitchen , Rachel Allen , Richard & Judy ) .

Courts in some states of the UAE regularly order floggings , for women as well as men , particularly but not exclusively for moral offences under Islamic law such as adultery and drinking alcohol . JCP has allegedly been abolished in Dubai but remains on the statute book in at least five of the other six Emirates . As far as can be ascertained , the normal practice is to apply a leather whip to the offender 's upper back , though the use of straps and canes has been reported in some cases . Some reports refer to the shirt being removed in the case of men , while female recipients remain fully dressed . According to one anecdotal account in Dec 2000 , prisoners in the UAE may also be flogged with a cane for internal prison infractions such as smuggling cigarettes . However , this report appeared in a not particularly reliable tabloid newspaper , and I have not yet seen this claim corroborated elsewhere . It is not clear whether floggings are still administered in public in the UAE . In 1977 it was reported that a man was given 100 lashes for rape in the central market of Abu Dhabi . This was said to be the first such case \" since Muslim religious courts took over jurisdiction of criminal cases \" . An Amnesty International report in 1989 ( not on line ) stated that two youths aged 16 and 18 were sentenced to 550 lashes each for theft . \" The sentences were carried out in public with the youths receiving approximately 40 lashes every Friday for three months . \" Reuters reported in 1995 that the Emirate of Ras al - Khaimah had extended the scope of flogging to include the not notably Koranic offence of dangerous driving . It was later claimed that this had been successful in reducing the road accident rate . A not altogether clear June 2006 news report stated that the penalty was no longer to be applied for petty crimes . In December 2006 the law was changed so that non- Muslims could no longer be flogged . It is possible that this was in part a response to embarrassing international publicity when an Estonian soldier , serving with a UN peacekeeping force in Afghanistan , was sentenced to be lashed for drinking alcohol during a stopover at Sharjah airport -- having been sold the drink by the airport 's own duty - free shop . He was eventually freed without being flogged ( Agence France Presse , 11 Apr 2006 ; Middle East Times , 19 Apr 2006 ) . This Feb 2007 news item clarifies that the punishment is to be carried out \" moderately and not with force or with a thick whip \" and that it is not supposed to cause bleeding . The best-known flogging case in the UAE is that of a teenage Filipina maid , Sarah Balabagan , originally sentenced in 1994 to death for killing her employer who had tried to rape her . Following an international outcry , this was commuted to a year in prison plus 100 lashes . She was duly flogged in 1996 with 20 lashes at a time on five separate days , privately in prison . EXTERNAL LINKS : ( these will open in a new window ) US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 1993 Here it is claimed that in 1993 the Federal Supreme Court ruled that Shari'a punishments such as flogging should not be imposed on non-Muslims , as they had been previously . ( But see next item . ) US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 1994 This report described floggings of Muslims by Islamic courts in the UAE as \" frequent \" , especially for adultery , prostitution and drunkenness , with sentences ranging from 80 to 200 lashes . The 1993 court ruling ( see previous item ) was clarified as meaning that non- Muslims are not required to be flogged , not that they must not be flogged . However , the report says that , although several non- Muslims had received JCP sentences , there was no indication that any of them had been carried out . US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 1995 According to this , flogging in the UAE is administered in such a way as to prevent injury : \" The individual administering the lashing traditionally holds a Koran under the arm and swings the whip using the forearm only \" . The document refers to certain individual cases , including floggings of non-Muslims , and in particular that of Sarah Balabagan ( see main text above ) . US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 1996 This report notes that there is no JCP in Dubai . It says a few floggings of non- Muslims were carried out in some other parts of the federation . ( The reports for 1997 to 2000 inclusive repeat the same information . ) Imprisonment and Flogging for Marriage Across Faiths 1997 Amnesty report on a case in which a 30 - year - old Christian man was sentenced to 39 lashes for marrying a Muslim woman . Amnesty International Report 1997 Several flogging cases are mentioned . Amnesty International Report 1998 Notes that JCP was extended to cover traffic offences in Ras al - Khaimah and also reportedly to begging . Several flogging sentences are discussed . Amnesty International Report 1999 More flogging sentences were imposed but it was not clear whether they had been carried out . Amnesty International Report 2001 At least 18 sentences of corporal punishment were handed down in 2000 , 11 of them in the Emirate of Fujairah . US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 2001 Mentions a case in which two foreigners , a man and his friend 's housemaid , were found in the friend 's house , convicted of \" cohabitation \" and sentenced to lashes and deportation . ( The 2002 report adds nothing of substance . ) US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 2003 The report states that flogging was sometimes carried out \" symbolically \" , but there had been at least one case in Abu Dhabi of the authorities using a leather strap to administer the sentence , which caused the recipient significant pain and left substantial bruising . Cases of JCP for adultery are mentioned . ( The 2004 report adds nothing new . ) Flogging Amnesty International report ( Dec 2004 ) about two women sentenced to flogging in the UAE for becoming pregnant outside marriage . US State Department Human Rights Practices Report 2005 Having for years repeatedly told us that JCP was banned in Dubai , the USSD now announces , without further explanation , that the Dubai Shari'a court in March 2005 sentenced a pregnant housemaid to 150 lashes for adultery . Elsewhere in the UAE there were also floggings for drug abuse , consensual premarital sex , prostitution , and defamation of character . Some authorities used leather straps and canes to administer the punishment , leaving bruising and welts .

It 's the unusual chemistry facilitated by this molecule , however , that will attract the most attention from scientists . Marsha Lester , the University of Pennsylvania 's Edmund J. Kahn Distinguished Professor , and Joseph Francisco , William E. Moore Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at Purdue University , found the molecule , which had puzzled and eluded scientists for more than 40 years . A technical paper describing the molecule is published this week in a special edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science . Somewhat like a human body metabolizing food , the Earth 's atmosphere has the ability to \" burn , \" or oxidize pollutants , especially nitric oxides emitted from sources such as factories and automobiles . What does n't get oxidized in the atmosphere falls back to Earth in the form of acid rain . \" The chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear , \" Francisco says . \" This gives us important insights into this process . Without that knowledge we really ca n't understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere . \" Francisco says the discovery will allow scientists to better model how pollutants react in the atmosphere and to predict potential outcomes . \" This becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as China , India and Brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated , \" Francisco says . \" This chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern . \" Lester says the molecule had been theorized by atmospheric chemists for 40 years and that she and Francisco had pursued it for the past several years . \" We 've speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years , and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting , \" she says . What makes the molecule so unusual is its two hydrogen bonds , which are similar to those found in water . Chemists know that although water is one of the most common substances found on the planet , it has unusual properties . For example , the solid form - ice - is lighter than the liquid form and floats . Water also boils at a much higher temperature than would be expected from its chemical structure . The cause of these strange behaviors are weak hydrogen bonds that hold water molecules together . The new atmospheric molecule has two hydrogen bonds , which allows it to form a six-sided ring structure . Hydrogen bonds are usually weaker than the normal bonds between atoms in a molecule , which are known as covalent bonds . In fact , covalent bonds are 20 times stronger than hydrogen bonds . But in this case , these two hydrogen bonds are strong enough to affect atmospheric chemistry , Francisco says . Lester says the new molecule exhibits its own unusual properties . \" The reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures , which is the opposite of most chemical reactions , \" she says . \" The rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure , and most reactions do n't depend on external pressure . The molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties . \" Lester says the unusual properties prevented scientists from being able to model the reaction for so long . \" This is not how we explain chemistry to high school students , \" she says . Francisco says that this discovery will be used in areas other than atmospheric chemistry . \" Here 's a situation where we were studying this purely environmental problem , but , because the findings are so fundamental , it may have broader ramifications to biological systems that depend on hydrogen bonds , \" he says . The breakthrough was enabled by laser - based laboratory techniques at the University of Pennsylvania and the supercomputing resources available at Purdue , Francisco says . The computation was done on an SGI Altix supercomputer operated by the Office of Information Technology at Purdue . \" The key is knowing where to look and how to identify new chemical entities , and with the computing resources we have at Purdue we can help identify processes to within experimental uncertainty , \" he says . \" We could n't have done this without the supercomputing power that we have available . \""}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

The interrogators etched the Chinese characters for \" Fight the Chinese Communists , Oppose the Soviet Union \" into Zhang 's left arm . During his incarceration , Zhang witnessed U.S. military police killing his comrades during a POW uprising on the island of Cheju . But after the war , Zhang -- who dug the offending words from his arm with a knife , leaving a long , white , numb trench -- was not welcomed home . For 30 years , he and thousands of other returning POWs were looked upon as traitors for failing to fight to the death and because of their close contact with Americans in POW camps . During the Cultural Revolution of 1966 - 76 , Zhang was the subject of a nationwide manhunt because he was considered an American spy . It was not until 1980 that China 's government acknowledged mistreatment of former POWs in an ambiguously worded explanation called Document 74 . But like the Korean War in the United States , what is officially called the \" War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea \" has remained very much a forgotten conflict here , with China 's role largely unexamined . Zhang and other veterans say it 's time for that to change . Fifty years after the eruption of the Korean War , a sensitive and significant debate is beginning in China . Spurred in part by the rapprochement between North and South Korea and improving ties between the United States and its old enemy in Pyongyang , Chinese scholars are for the first time posing difficult questions about the decision to send more than 1 million troops over the Yalu River into North Korea . Should China have entered the war ? Who started the war ? Were China 's losses and expenses -- estimated at almost 1 million killed or wounded and $ 10 billion -- worth it ? Why does n't China 's military code give its soldiers the right to surrender ? And , even , did China fight on the right side ? \" We were told that the war was to protect China , \" said Zhang Zeshi , another POW from the 180th Division , who is not related to Zhang Da . \" But later we discovered we were n't really fighting for China . We were fighting for [ North Korean leader ] Kim Il Sung . Then we discovered he was a feudal lord . And that he started the war . If North Korea had turned out like South Korea , rich and democratic , then it would have been worth it . But that 's not what happened . \" China officially marked the 50th anniversary of its entry into the conflict on Wednesday with documentaries and celebrations emphasizing its victory and the righteousness of its cause . But in Internet chat rooms and in several magazines , Chinese are for the first time publicly mulling over questions that the United States , South Korea and Russia have been discussing for years . Only the Stalinist government in North Korea remains closed more tightly than China on these matters . Although subdued , the debate marks the first public criticism of the foreign policy of Mao Zedong , the dictator who steered China into the conflict . Everything else Mao did -- from his disastrous economic policies to his political campaigns that ruined millions of lives -- has been the subject of faultfinding by the Chinese . But Mao 's geopolitical strategy , which kept China at loggerheads with the West for decades after the Communist victory in 1949 , has remained untouchable until now . The first stone thrown in the debate came late last year in an article in Suibi , an obscure magazine published in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou . For the first time in China , a writer argued that Kim Il Sung started the war , that the United States had no intention of crossing the Yalu River and attacking China , and that China 's losses far outweighed its gains . The article , written by Yuan Xi , a reporter for the People 's Daily , the mouthpiece of the Communist Party , acknowledged that the war helped the Communist government consolidate its power . But it argued that the conflict also kept China out of the United Nations for more than two decades and retarded its economic and social development . The war also helped turn Japan , China 's main Asian rival , into an economic power and greatly benefited the Soviet Union , the article contended . Citing both Western research and internal reports , the article challenged Chinese official statistics , arguing that 900,000 Chinese were killed or wounded instead of the 740,000 acknowledged by China . It said that China spent $ 10 billion fighting the war , not $ 3.5 billion . It also complained that the \" free \" support promised by Joseph Stalin never arrived . China ended up owing Moscow $ 1.34 billion for \" used weaponry from World War II , \" it said . Finally , the article suggested something that Chinese scholars have discussed for years but that no one has dared to print : that Mao 's decision to enter the Korean War prevented China from recovering Taiwan . Reunification with the island remains a Holy Grail for China 's aging Communist leadership . \" Did China do right ? \" the article asked . \" Did China have a better choice ? Should the Chinese people have a new perspective about this war ? And from the lessons of this experience should we get a new understanding and appropriately confront the challenges of the future ? \" Last month , the article was attacked in the journal of the Academy of Military Science , the leading research arm of the People 's Liberation Army . Senior Col. Qi Dexue , a Korean War scholar , defended the decision to enter the conflict , arguing that doing so stymied U.S. plots to destabilize China . The war firmly placed China in the camp of the \" anti-imperialists , \" and protected China from further U.S. plots by establishing a buffer zone in North Korea , Qi wrote . \" In today 's society , there is definitely a tendency to find fault with , unveil the scars of , look for the dark side and even totally negate the history of the Communist Party , \" Qi wrote . In the murky world of Chinese politics , the debate about Korea is seen as an indirect way of questioning China 's current foreign policy . Beijing 's leadership remains wary of the West ; in recent years it has again started to lean toward Russia , from which it buys more than $ 1 billion of weapons a year . China continues to back regimes at odds with the West , such as those of ousted president Slobodan Milosevic in Yugoslavia and Saddam Hussein in Iraq , as well as those in Libya and Burma . Chinese strategists have spent years proving that the Korean War showed how China could take on powers stronger than itself , especially the United States . The army has used this as the basis of its policy of military modernization , which is aimed at conquering Taiwan and keeping the United States at bay . \" If the Korean War is shown to have been a mistake , then it calls into question the wisdom of taking on the United States over Taiwan , \" said Thomas Christensen , an expert on modern Chinese history at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . \" It raises doubts about the military 's belief that force can solve the Taiwan issue . There is really little that is more sensitive than that in China 's strategic thinking . \" In his article , Qi argued that the defeat of the 180th Division was not caused by the army 's senior officers , but by mistakes by lower - ranking soldiers . Their persecution upon returning to China was justified , he said . China 's military code does not permit its soldiers to surrender . Unlike such countries as the United States or France , where such former POWs as Arizona Sen . John McCain and the late French president Francois Mitterrand have become leading politicians , being a POW in China marks one as a traitor . For Zhang Zeshi , a Communist Party member , the criticism was even more severe . \" A revolutionary soldier is not permitted to surrender , especially a party member , \" Zhang said . \" But I think that 's a feudal idea . \" Zhang was stripped of his party membership in 1954 and , despite having a degree from prestigious Qinghua University , was forced to take a job as a high school teacher . A party official forced Zhang 's fiancee to denounce him ; the official then took her as his bride . Zhang was dispatched to the countryside for almost 10 years . During the Cultural Revolution , his students placed a dunce cap on his head and called him a traitor and a spy . He was jailed and lived in a cowshed . After the Cultural Revolution , Zhang fought to restore the reputation of POWs and the fighters of the 180th Division . Backed by Gen. He Min , who persuaded Zhang and his comrades to return to China following the war , Zhang and others ultimately persuaded party leaders to issue Document 74 . That document had a direct effect on Zhang Da 's life . He came out of hiding and in the mid-1980s embraced China 's economic reforms , opening a successful Sichuanese restaurant in Beijing . \" I 'm lucky , \" said Zhang , who as a wounded POW almost lost his leg to an American surgeon 's knife . \" I've lived through it all . But my biggest complaint is still about the Communist Party . They do n't respect history . . . . If you do n't face your history , you 're going to repeat it . \" \u00a9 2000 The Washington Post Peruse More InterNetwork Notices Peruse Older InterNetwork Notices DISCLAIMER : The content of this message is the sole responsibility of the originator .

This young man , only 28 then , was already famous in France as a geologist and chemist . He was also quite rich and a nobleman himself . The young man , Antoine Lavoisier , accepted . And that 's how Marie Anne became Madame Lavoisier . Though being a desperate marriage , Marie Anne shared many interests with her husband . Unlike many women of her time , she was very interested in chemistry . She had a flair for languages which her famous husband did not have . This was very useful , for she was the first to read about scientific advances in Britain in Germany first ! She would then translate articles into French or Latin , which Antoine Lavoisier could read . The Lavoisiers ' experiment on phlogiston is considered among the most beautiful in science . Do you know how it came about ? Madame was translating a book on the subject by Irish scientist Richard Kirwan . She found that he made a lot of errors , which she pointed out at every step . When she gave the translated book to Antoine Lavoisier , it had more of her notes than Kirwan 's writings . And that was how he was convinced that phlogiston was false . While Lavoisier was quite an academically minded person , Madame was more practical . She used to keep the lab records and ensured that the experiments were carried out according to procedure . Having learned drawing , she would make neat diagrams of the experiments . That made understanding the experiments much easier . It was also a lesson to other scientists on how to do experiments properly . Antoine Lavoisier was quite happy doing experiments , but did n't bother to share the results with people . Madame Lavoisier on the other hand was very keen . She organised all his results and made him write a proper book . She had it published in 1789 . Known as the ' Elementary Treatise on Chemistry ' , it is considered among the best chemistry books ever written . Sadly , Antoine Lavoisier was executed in 1784 in the French Revolution . His property was seized and his wife was thrown to the mercy of the streets . However , she fought all these difficulties to try and publish the remaining experiments . She finally succeeded , in a book called The Memoirs of Chemistry . By the time she died in 1836 , she had restored her husband 's reputation . It 's because of her that we often say that there is a woman behind every successful man !"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

President Barack Obama signed an executive memorandum setting up a taskforce on obesity headed by his wife . \" My administration is committed to redoubling our efforts to solve the problem of childhood obesity within a generation through a comprehensive approach that builds on effective strategies , engages families and communities , and mobilises both public and private sector resources , \" the memorandum said . \" I am so proud of the work that the First Lady , along with the cabinet secretaries behind me , have done in trying to tackle one of the most urgent health issues that we have in this country , \" Mr Obama said as he signed the memorandum , his wife 's hand on his arm and the secretaries of health , education , agriculture and the interior looking on . Because of obesity and the illnesses associated with it , including diabetes , heart disease and some cancers , doctors have warned that the current generation of US children could be the first to live shorter , less healthy lives than their parents . Nearly one in five US children aged six to 19 are obese and one in three is overweight . Even babies are not immune to the scourge , with about 10 per cent classified as obese . The childhood obesity rate tripled in the United States between 1980 - 1999 , creating an epidemic blamed on lack of exercise , a poor diet that is heavy on fat and sugar and not enough fresh fruits and vegetables . The swelling obesity rate in the United States has also caused medical costs associated with excessive weight to balloon from about $ US78 billion ( $ 90.2 billion ) a year in 1998 to about $ US147 billion annually in 2006 , a study released last year showed . \" We must act now to improve the health of our nation 's children and avoid spending billions of dollars treating preventable disease , \" the memorandum said . Last year , at the first major meeting on obesity in the US , childhood obesity was described as the country 's worst health crisis , and parents were urged to ban television in children 's rooms as a first step to making sure children got out and exercised . Politicians have been encouraged to slap a tax on sugary drinks to combat obesity , and several schools have banned junk food from vending machines and even chocolate milk from the canteen in an effort to fight the fat . \" We want to eliminate this problem of childhood obesity in a generation , \" Mrs Obama said in a television interview on Tuesday . The first lady , who was vice - president of a Chicago hospital before her husband 's election , was also firmly on the warpath against obesity in the first year of Mr Obama 's administration . She has highlighted healthy living by planting a vegetable garden on the lawn of the White House and joining in physical activities - including showing off impressive hula- hooping skills - with US schoolchildren . \" We 're launching a nationwide campaign called Let 's Move , \" Mrs Obama said , adding that the importance of physical activity was something she stressed with her own young daughters , Sasha and Malia . \" My kids have to get up and move .

EoE is a rare , chronic , inflammatory disease that occurs when eosinophils , a type of white blood cell , accumulate in the oesophagus causing injury and inflammation . 1 The FDA grants ODD status to medicines and potential new medicines intended for the treatment , diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the US . Mene Pangalos , Executive Vice President , BioPharmaceuticals R&D , said : \u201c Eosinophilic oesophagitis is an allergic inflammatory disease that can affect children and adults , and typically patients experience a range of debilitating symptoms including severe pain and difficulty swallowing food . Currently there are no FDA - approved treatments for eosinophilic oesophagitis . Because Fasenra depletes eosinophils in blood and tissue , it could become a potential new medicine to treat patients with this rare disease . \u201d Fasenra is AstraZeneca 's first respiratory biologic medicine and is currently approved as an add - on maintenance treatment for severe , eosinophilic asthma in the US , EU , Japan and other countries . In November 2018 , the FDA granted ODD for Fasenra for the treatment of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis ( EGPA ) , and also granted ODD for the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome ( HES ) in February 2019 . About EoE EoE is a rare , chronic , inflammatory disease of the oesophagus characterised by the accumulation of eosinophils , a type of white blood cell that are a normal part of the immune system , in the oesophageal lining tissue . The disease results in injury , fibrosis and dysfunction that if not effectively treated can make eating difficult or uncomfortable , potentially leading to chronic pain , difficulty swallowing , poor growth , malnutrition and weight loss . 1 The most common symptoms of EoE include reflux that does not respond to medication , difficulty swallowing , food becoming stuck in the oesophagus , nausea and vomiting , abdominal or chest pain , poor appetite and difficulty sleeping . 1 Patients are often treated with corticosteroids to manage inflammation . Currently there are no FDA - approved treatments for EoE.1 About Fasenra Fasenra ( benralizumab ) is a monoclonal antibody that binds directly to the IL - 5 receptor alpha on eosinophils and attracts natural killer cells to induce rapid and near-complete depletion of eosinophils via apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) . 2,3 Fasenra is AstraZeneca 's first respiratory biologic , now approved as an add - on maintenance treatment in severe eosinophilic asthma in the US , EU , Japan and other countries , with further regulatory reviews ongoing . In June 2019 , the European Medicines Agency 's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ( CHMP ) issued a positive opinion for Fasenra self - administration and the Fasenra pen , a new auto-injector delivery device . Fasenra is in development for severe nasal polyposis , eosinophilic oesophagitis , eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis , hypereosinophilic syndrome and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Fasenra was developed by AstraZeneca and is in - licensed from BioWa , Inc. , a wholly - owned subsidiary of Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co. , Ltd. , Japan .

Coyote Oldman ) \u2014 dried yucca flower stalks , hollow inside , with holes that were beautifully bored by some natural agent . I photographed them in November 2012 .

The Magic Flute In 2013 , I received a copy of The Magic Flute by Kaye Feather Robinson , now published on this site and also available as a PDF file ( [ Robinson - KW 2012 ] ) . It tells the story of an afternoon journey in October 2006 to a petroglyph site in Utah by Feather , Peter Phippen , Jan Seiden , and Cecelia Turbyville . Here 's are some excerpts : After I finished the stories , I noticed a yucca stalk on the floor . \u2026 I told Peter that the teachings were over and it was time to give an offering of Flute Music . \u2026 He saw what others did not see . He saw six small holes that tiny critters had left in the old hollow stick . \u2026 \u201c I think I can play the stick . \u201d Peter surprised everyone with this statement . I thought I knew plants and plants usages . But this was new to me . He picked up the stick and so began the music of the Yucca . With spiffy suit and shiny shoes , Peter crawled up into the circular place below the Great Teacher and began the haunting music . Time stopped . Peter forgot to look at his watch . The need to get back to the reception was no more . The World stood still and the music of the ancient ones blended with the music of today . The Ancient Flute Players came alive through Peter\u00e2s breath . Plant united with Man. Past united with Present . The Center Place was vibrating with new life . The hum of the Universe was heard once again . We were one . In June 2015 I found this description by Peter Phippen of this potential origin for the embouchure hole , the earliest mention of which I am aware . From [ Crawford 1999 b ] : I live in Wis [ consin ] and in my backyard there is a cane - like plant that bugs burrow into to hibernate for the Winter . One Spring I noticed a flute - like sound coming from one of these stalks . Upon investigating , I found that a bug had left a small hole in the side of the stalk , making a flute - like sound when the wind blew . Could early man have stumbled onto something like this ? If so , the cane or bamboo flute would have come first . Perhaps the earliest flutes were one - or two - note flutes with no holes , with the second note and possibly a few overtones ( depending on the length of the instrument ) being achieved by over blowing . Yucca and related plants The group of plants that might be considered for proto-flutes includes yucca , sotol , and agave . An excellent primer on these plants can be found on The Agaves and Nolinas page of the Saguaro - Juniper web site . | | | | Yucca plant with inflorescense . Photo courtesy of Keith Stanford These plants produce an inflorescense \u2014 a cluster of flowers arranged on a stem . The stem can be composed of a main branch or a complex arrangement of branches . The photo at the left , courtesy of Keith Stanford ( Kieta [ key - eh - tah ] ) of Cherry Cows Flutes shows a small yucca plant with two inflorescense stalks - an old , dried stalk and a new stalk emerging . Kieth describes this picture : Here are a couple of pictures I took last week down on my ranch by Tombstone , AZ . You can see the old stalk on top of this small Yucca , and the ' new ' stalk just starting to come out . These stalks grown at an unbelievable rate of about two feet per month . Ethnobotany These excerpts from [ Gibbs 2003 ] ( pages 2 - 1 and 6 - 7 ) and gives some background on the ethno-botany of yucca and related plants in the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge , New Mexico : The San Andres Mountains contain five general plant communities , including desert shrub , desert riparian , grass - shrub , mountain shrub and pi\u00c3\u00b1on juniper . Vegetation found within the San Andres National Wildlife Refuge includes needle and thread grass ( Stipa comata ) , gramma grass ( Boteuloua spp. ) , mountain mahogany ( Cercocarpus montanus ) , prickly pear cactus ( Opuntia spp. ) , agave ( Agave spp. ) , Yucca ( Yucca spp. ) , and ocotillo ( Fouquieria splendens ) . Higher elevations contain stands of pi\u00c3\u00b1on pine ( Pinus edulis ) and juniper ( Juniperus monosperma ) . Desert willow ( Chilopsis linearis ) and apache plume ( Fallugia paradoxa ) are found around springs and major drainages ( [ RMC 1998 ] ) . While still speculative , several studies of the Apache Indians can be valuable in understanding prehistoric subsistence patterns . Basehart\u00e2s ( 1973 ) study ( [ Basehart 1973 ] ) , for example , based on ethnographic research , examines water gathering , agriculture , and place names with territorial references . The study provides a long list of usable stone , animal , and plant resources in semi-desert brush , grassland , woodland , and forest ecozones . His study strongly indicates that almost every plant was of some subsistence , medicinal , or architectural value . The four wild food crops that proved most important , primarily for food storage purposes , were mescal , datil fruit from Yucca bacatta , pi\u00c3\u00b1on nuts , and mesquite beans ( [ Basehart 1973 ] ) . The majority of all the wild foods utilized by the Mescalero are known to exist within 2 km of the bajada slope ( [ Johnson - M 1991 ] ) . Who drilled the holes ? What creatures made those holes in the yucca stalks ? Several citations from ethno-botanists provide some clues . From [ Castetter 1938 ] , page 51 \u00b6 2 : Small quantities of honey , the product of large wild carpenter bees , were occasionally obtained from agave flower stalks by the Maricopa ( [ Spier 1933 ] , page 73 \u00b6 3 \u2014 see below ) , while in Havasupai territory wild carpenter bees had their hives in flower stalks of dead agave ( [ Spier 1928 ] , page 108 \u00b6 3 \u2014 see below ) . From [ Spier 1933 ] , page 73 \u00b6 3 : Honey was occasionally obtained form the flower stalks of mescal , but these contained very little . This was the product of large bees ( m \u00c5spo'kw \u00c4ni'ly \u00c8\u00a7 , \" black bee \" ) . This classification of \" bees \" is rather interesting : working bees were called flies ( xaly\u00c8\u00a7smo''kw\u00c4ly\u00c8\u00a7vi'na ) ; another bee with a yellow back ( not a hornet ) was m \u00c5spo'cilyam\u00c5'kk\u00c8\u00a7kw\u00c4's \u00c4c ; a fourth variety , resembling a was was m \u00c5spo'kw \u00c4s\u00c4 'c , \" yellow bee . \" The nests of working bees were found and the insects killed individually , but their honey was not eaten . From [ Spier 1928 ] , page 73 \u00b6 3 : Wild bees hive in dead logs and the flower stalks of dead mescal . According to Brad Young of 4 Wind Flutes , ( information he provided in an open forum for flute makers on May 4 , 2013 ) : In the desert , carpenter bee females nest in sotol and various yucca and agave bloom stalks , or they may take up residence in dead tree trunks and limbs , firewood or wooden structures . Beginning in the spring , a female , like a miniature carpenter , will burrow a half - inch - diameter horizontal tunnel so perfectly circular that it could have been produced by a power drill . She leaves , in her wake , a small pile of sawdust beneath her construction site . Within her tunnel , which extends perhaps six to 10 inches deep into wood , she excavates a gallery where she deposits her eggs . Here is a photo of a nest , or \u201c gallery \u201d , created by carpenter bees in a 2 \u00d74 piece of wood : | | | | Carpenter bee nest ( gallery ) in a 2\u00d74 piece of wood . Photo April 25 , 2011 by Wikimedia user Belchergb Here is a photo provided by Keith Stanford from his Native Yucca Stalk Flute Making Manual ( [ Stanford 2012 ] ) showing \u201c a perfect , insect - made bore , except that it is too narrow for what I wanted , so I gouged it out wider .

From an email on May 3 , 2013 : Last summer , I harvested about a dozen Yucca - stalks and was driving down the Interstate back to Tucson . I looked in the rearview mirror and saw what appeared to be a black bat hovering near my ear . After trying to control the resulting swerve across both lanes of the highway , I was able to get my SUV stopped and I bailed out of my vehicle . Now remember , there are cars speeding by at 75 MPH and it is about 105 degrees in the shade \u2026 I was in the sun \u2026 and I am running around the vehicle like a madman trying to open all the doors . Out flew about a half dozen MONSTER - sized black bumble bees ! They came out of those large holes in the Yucca-stalks . Interesting side note , when I got back to Tucson I laid these Yucca - stalks on my work bench outside , and for about two weeks I had two black bumble bees hovering around \u2026 even after I moved the Yucca-stalks to a different location away from my house . | | | | Bee photographed by Keith Stanford Later in 2013 , Keith captured one of the critters on his cell phone . From an email on October 28 , 2013 : I was out harvesting Sotol-stalks and after I got the batch home I commenced to cutting them all to the proper length for flutes . While I was doing this , I noticed my dog , who was standing next to me , started twisting her head the way dogs do when they hear something that is ' odd ' to them . So I turned off the band - saw to see if I could hear what was of interest to her , and out popped a bee from one of the holes on the Sotol-stalk and landed on my book . ( It was buzzing quite loudly on it 's exit from the stalk , but once it exited it was quite lethargic and did n't fly off . Just sort of crawled around for a while . I think it had already passed its usefulness as an insect and was about ready to call it quits . ) I grabbed my cell phone and snapped this picture for y'all . You now have an actual picture and a bona fide witness for Flutopedia of a real live insect that made the holes in these stalks ! Evidence for Yucca Flutes in the Archaeological Literature This section is an analysis by Christine Oravec , version 3 dated April 2 , 2014 . Published reports of flutes made of yucca stalks may be found in the work of archaeologist Walter Hough . In 1901 and 1905 he accompanied expeditions to the Mogollon area of west central New Mexico . Two organizations sponsored the expeditions . The first was a group of private individuals that later founded the Southwest Museum of the Archaeological Institute of America , at that time located near Pasadena CA . The second was the United States National Museum , a division of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , DC . The artifacts collected during the expeditions were distributed between the two organizations . After the 1905 expedition Hough returned to the USNM . He eventually became head curator of anthropology and spent the rest of his career documenting the Smithsonian\u00e2s vast collection of Native American artifacts ( [ Pavesic 1999 ] , page 140 ) . Hough published two reports mentioning yucca flutes unearthed during the expeditions . The first report included only a brief statement about the instruments themselves : \u201c Music was also a pastime of these ancients , who used flutes of reed and yucca stalks \u201d ( [ Hough 1907 ] , page 27 ) . Nevertheless his identification of the artifacts as made of yucca was credible . Hough was an ethnobotanist as well as an archaeologist , and he published several articles on succulents and their use among such Southwestern native tribes as the Hopi ( [ Judd 1936 ] , page 477 ) . In 1914 Hough published another report for the Smithsonian ( [ Hough 1914 ] ) that commented upon and illustrated artifacts of flutes . These were specifically identified as excavated at the Tularosa and Bear Cave sites in the Mogollon region . Under the title \u201c Flute Pahos \u201d he included detailed descriptions and pictures of flutes made of cane , reed , yucca slats and yucca fibers . In particular , the illustration shown in Figure 330 represented a flute paho made of a single hollowed - out yucca stalk with no identifiable breath or finger holes . Note : In this section of the report Hough frequently used the term \u201c paho . \u201d Otherwise known as \u201c prayer sticks , \u201d pahos were solid pieces of wood or vegetal fiber decorated with feathers , twine and paint . They were primarily used as ceremonial objects . The Hopis , for example , inserted small sticks made of willow or cottonwood topped with feathers into the ground in front of altars during the Flute Ceremony . These sticks functioned as symbolic flutes ( [ Payne 1993 ] , pages 19 and 55 \u2013 56 ) . Apparently Hough distinguished pahos representing flutes from other kinds of pahos by their length ( from 9.25 to 12.5 inches ) , their straight shape , and the fact that they were bored from end to end . As for their functionality as musical instruments , Hough did not require that a hollow stick should display identifiable breath and finger holes to qualify as a conventional flute ( Figure 327 ) . He appeared however to be more confident when a stick did display such holes ( Figure 328 ) . Hough\u00e2s criteria evoke the possibility that some ancient Southwestern rim-blown overtone flutes may have required neither breath holes nor finger holes , in part because of their ceremonial significance . In 1950 , Paul S. Martin conducted another excavation of the Tularosa cave complex and confirmed the presence of flutes made of cane . See The Tularosa Cave Flutes .

This image of a rock art panel near the San Juan River , near Bluff , Utah was published in [ Manning - SJ 1992 ] , figure 20 . Manning states that the plant image \u201c resembles \u201d yucca . It was also analyzed in [ Slifer 1994 ] , figure 148 , who state ( pages 89\u201390 ) that : [ O ] ne interesting petroglyph panel portrays a row of figures : five fluteplayers to the right and four fluteplayers to the left of a centrally placed plant form ( yucca in bloom ? ) . All nine fluteplayers are phallic and wear and unusual variety of head - dresses ; one is humpbacked . Christine Oravec notes that \u201c From my personal experience , it is difficult but not impossible to distinguish rock art depictions of plants according to species . Most are corn . Having seen well - defined corn depictions , however , and noting the sheer number of flower and leaf stalks in this depiction and their relative directions with relationship to the main stalk , I think Slifer and Duffield made a pretty good guess . \u201d | | | | Nine flute players facing a central plant form .

Here are six narratives in the Origin of the Native American flute section of the Narratives page on this site , and a very brief summary of the source of the flute : - Comanche Flute Origin ( [ Bee 2006 ] ) : \u201c a man who had suffered greatly \u2026 had a dream \u2026 old cedar trees \u2026 dead branches in which the woodpeckers had drilled holes \u2026 wind blew , creating a sweet and soothing sound \u201d . - The Sound of Flutes ( [ Erdoes 1976 ] , [ Wapp 1984 ] ) : \u201c a young hunter \u2026 meat was scarce \u2026 redheaded woodpecker \u2026 alighted on a cedar tree and began tapping and hammering on a dead branch \u2026 a gust of wind \u2026 the hunter heard that beautiful sound right \u201d . - The Origin of the Courting Flute ( [ Deloria 1961 ] , [ Wapp 1984 ] ) : \u201c a youth who \u2026 loved only one maiden \u2026 heard human voices coming from a grove of trees \u2026 two \u2026 unsurpassably handsome young men \u2026 their bodies seemed to emit glimmering light \u2026 had with them a long flute and one began to play \u2026 from the mouth of this flute , which was made like that of the gar , came a sweet , piercing sound \u201d . - The Origin of the Flageolet ( [ Densmore 1923 ] , pages 80 \u2013 84 ) : \u201c Old Granny ( a.k.a. the Old Woman Who Never Dies ) \u2026 went into the field and got a large sunflower stalk . She took a long section of this , bored a hole lengthwise through it , and cut seven holes in one side of it . She said the seven holes represented the seven months of winter , and told the boy that when he blew in it something would come out of it which would resemble snow . It was her intention to bring the snow to punish the two men for frightening the little boy \u201d . - Flute Origin Story from \u201c The Whirlwind and the Elk in the Mythology of the Dakota \u201d ( [ Wissler 1905 ] , pages 262\u2013266 ) : \u201c a young man \u2026 fell in love with the daughter of a wealthy man \u2026 [ he ] saw a man , scarcely visible . The man looked old , and his hair was white \u2026 gave him a thick red stick wrapped in sage grass \u2026 ' you are to go out and circle around the camp blowing upon this flageolet ' \u2026 The flageolet was inside of the grass bundle . This is the way they got the flageolet \u201d . - The Legend of the Flute \u2014 Brule Sioux ( [ Erdoes 1984 ] , pages 275\u2013278 ) : similar to The Sound of Flutes , described above . Next Steps One of the next steps in this line of inquiry would be to try some basic experiments . The idea would be to set up yucca stalks with naturally bored holes and a hollow core in a controlled environment where a wind could be driven at the stalks at varying angles and speeds ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Some of those songs are almost 50 years old , and they have stood the test of time . I have a few favourites : Yesterday , because it 's as great a song as could ever be written , and the fact it has been covered thousands of times attests to that ; and I love , Here There and Everywhere , and Maybe I 'm Amazed . I have two older sisters who took me to see the Beatles when I was about seven . It was so galvanising ; I got a little guitar and wanted to play their songs . I have met McCartney a couple of times . We were both up for an Academy award [ in 2001 ] the year Randy Newman won , and I remember standing there , thinking : \" Wow , if the little kid version of me knew that one day I would be a loser with Paul McCartney ... \" As a songwriter you need a gift for melody , and for saying something you 've heard a million times in a different way . There are only so many notes and ideas , but you twist it and turn it and make it new , by the chords or melodies or a weird key change . In just a few years , the Beatles created this genius body of work , and those songs will never go away . Diane Warren has written for Elton John , Barbra Streisand and Aretha Franklin ; she has been Oscar-nominated six times . Brian Higgins on Brandon Flowers I have a lot of admiration and respect for Gary Barlow , Cathy Dennis and more recently Skylar Grey , who I think is an outstanding talent . But the person whose songs have been with me for most of the last decade is Brandon Flowers , lead singer and principal songwriter of the Killers . The first time I became fully aware of his songwriting was when Somebody Told Me became a big hit in 2004 . At the time my production company Xenomania was having a lot of success , and I remember I brought this song into one of our production meetings and played it to everyone , saying that we had been \" beaten \" . In many ways it encapsulated everything we were trying to achieve : it was aggressive but catchy , very witty but also deep and believable . Songwriting is highly competitive , and it is very difficult to listen to things without any cynicism . But Brandon 's material is so good , powerful and moving that it destroys any attempt I might have made to criticise it . I listen as a fan . Brian Higgins 's Xenomania company has written for Girls Aloud , Kylie Minogue and New Order . Amanda Ghost on Joni Mitchell She is one of the greatest lyricists of the 20th century . I do n't like it when people call songwriters poets because I do n't think we are : poems and lyrics are incredibly different . Lyrics fall into a melody . When we read lyrics on a page they can be profound , but it 's only when you put them with music that they take on another dimension . Mitchell pioneered the female singer -songwriter perspective in modern pop music . Nobody really did introspection and personal confession like her . She is the standard that unfortunately I measure everyone against , and nobody really comes up to the bar . My favourite is A Case of You , and my favourite lines are : \" You 're in my blood like holy wine / You taste so bitter and so sweet / I could drink a case of you / And I would still be on my feet . \" They 've deeply changed me and the way I write . Before I heard Mitchell , I would never go to the point of being so confessional ; she taught me to strip away the poetry and get to the heart and bones . When you do that , the public reacts because it is honest ; that is why her work has endured . Amanda Ghost has written for James Blunt , Beyonc\u00e9 and Florence and the Machine . Rob Fusari on Lady Gaga I first heard her work when she came to my studio in New Jersey in March 2006 . She performed two songs : Hollywood and Again and Again . I had n't heard songwriting like this since the days of Freddie Mercury and David Bowie . It felt like Christmas morning , and the first time I had my heart broken , all tightly wrapped up in three minutes . My favourite song of hers is Brown Eyes . In certain songs you feel the pain or the joy of the author , but we do n't hear or see a lot of that today . It 's the most creatively naked song and performance I 've heard from Gaga to date . I believe she is one of those songwriters who can find the balance between personal experience and pop culture . She writes songs for the stage as opposed to the radio , which lends itself to a more theatrical approach . Rob Fusari has written for Lady Gaga , Beyonc\u00e9 and Britney Spears . Nina Woodford on Kate Bush I find her melodies beautiful and unexpected , and it 's the same for her lyrics . The fact she released [ her debut album ] The Kick Inside when she was 19 is amazing in itself . Even the few things I have n't liked have always been thought - provoking and interesting ; as a writer , she makes me feel free to dare to try different things . There are very few women who write that kind of direct poetry . A lot of women get judged on other things . She has n't been intimidated into feeling she has to be cute , or charming . There are loads of great female writers , but not many who were n't trying to be sexy or attractive or cool . She has written two of my top 10 songs ever : Wuthering Heights and This Woman 's Work . Her songs just paint the picture for me \u2013 I 'm there . Nina Woodford has written for Tom Jones , James Morrison and Leona Lewis ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Clumsy use of the mysterious nerve agent caused the deaths of at least 115 hostages in addition to disabling most of the 50 Chechen hostage - takers . The antidote being used is for the group of nerve agents related to the gas BZ , developed by the US military in the 1970s . BZ is a \" glycolate \" which attacks the central nervous system . It was developed by the US Department of Defence and is considered non-lethal if applied correctly . Russian authorities initially refused to name the gas that killed the hostages , leading to complaints that it was making their job of treating patients with antidotes much harder . Yet chemical warfare experts told the Guardian that Moscow doctors had been given an antidote by the Russian military for a rare nerve agent developed by the US military , called BZ . Professor Steven Rose , of the Open University , said a Russian counterpart had told him that doctors had been supplied the antidote from a military stockpile . \" All nerve agents , like Sarin gas and those that the Iraqis use , block the transmissions between nerve and muscle \" , said Professor Rose . \" These would produce the memory deficits that hostages have talked about . \" The symptoms usually caused by BZ match those of the hostages carried out of the building . It causes skin to be drained of colour , sweating , victims to appear concussed , possibly have respiratory problems . Victims can also experience hallucinations and huge anxiety attacks . Prof Rose said he had been in contact yesterday with a Russian counterpart , Professor Konstantin Anokhin at the Institute of Normal Physiology in Moscow , who shared his suspicions about the identity of the gas . Prof Anokhin said he had spoken to doctors treating the hostages who had been supplied by the Russian military with an antidote for general class of substances to which BZ belonged . \" BZ is a muscarnic cholinergic blocker , \" said Prof Rose . \" It affects a special type of nerve , known as a muscarnic receptor , in the brain . When it is released into the atmosphere , it gets into the lungs . It then passes through the blood stream and through the entire brain . \" Prof Rose said the agent affected the chemical acetylcholine , which carries messages from one nerve cell to another . \" BZ interacts with this and stops the message getting across \" , he added . \" It 's like turning the volume up on a radio , and stopping any changes in the signal , so the message loses all its meaning . \" The agent works on the brain and paralyses its ability to interpret what is going on . \" It turns off the lights , and destroys the body 's headquarters . \" Prof Rose added that the people least likely to be affected by the gas were the terrorists themselves as they are the healthiest and the most prepared for such a situation . \" It will affect the young and the old more than the fit , \" he said . There were many young women among the casualties carried from the theatre . \" Obviously in this case it was used in grossly high concentrations , \" he said . \" The victims appear to be the very young and old , which you would expect if it was used in a confined space . \" The gas has never been used before , Prof Rose said , except perhaps in secret , or in a US propaganda film in the 1970s , by the US Department of Defence . \" It was stockpiled and never used in the west . \" Prof Rose said he had experimented with the gas - which originally comes as a white powder mixed with a propellant , in a laboratory , but never on humans . He was not aware if the Soviet Union had obtained the gas . \" It is bound to be lethal in high concentrations , \" said Prof Rose . \" It would shut down the brain and if this happens for long enough the body stops getting oxygen and the brain itself dies . \" The use of chemical agents , whether BZ or other similar agents which attack the central nervous system , had two major implications , according to Dr Malcolm Dando , professor of international security at Bradford University 's school of peace studies , who also advises the UN . They are new forms of agents in which both the American and Russian military are increasingly interested as they develop \" non-lethal \" weapons following growing understanding of the nervous system . \" They are a harbinger of what 's to come , \" warned Dr Dando . He also pointed out that because of a loophole these nerve agents are not covered by the international chemical weapons convention . The US has said they have the right to use them . \" We are going down a very slippery path towards new forms of agents , \" Dr Dando added . He said the agents could be developed for mind control . The International Commitee of the Red Cross recently expressed concern about the development of so -called \" non-lethal \" weapons . The Russian military have considered using such \" non-lethal incapacitants \" before , said Lev Feodorov , the president of the Union of Chemical Security , to stop the coup attempt of 1993 . Yet they decided against it . One analyst said such gases were highly delicate substances whose improper use could be disastrous . \" It is a very exact process putting them together , \" said defence expert Paul Beaver ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

But , in regard to Texas , enough has now been given to party . It is time for the common duty of Patriotism to the Country to succeed ; -- or if this claim will not be recognized , it is at least time for common sense to acquiesce with decent grace in the inevitable and the irrevocable . Texas is now ours . Already , before these words are written , her Convention has undoubtedly ratified the acceptance , by her Congress , of our proffered invitation into the Union ; and made the requisite changes in her already republican form of constitution to adapt it to its future federal relations . Her star and her stripe may already be said to have taken their place in the glorious blazon of our common nationality ; and the sweep of our eagle 's wing already includes within its circuit the wide extent of her fair and fertile land . She is no longer to us a mere geographical space --a certain combination of coast , plain , mountain , valley , forest and stream . She is no longer to us a mere country on the map . She comes within the dear and sacred designation of Our Country ; no longer a \" pays , \" she is a part of \" la patrie ; \" and that which is at once a sentiment and a virtue , Patriotism , already begins to thrill for her too within the national heart . It is time then that all should cease to treat her as alien , and even adverse -- cease to denounce and vilify all and everything connected with her accession -- cease to thwart and oppose the remaining steps for its consummation ; or where such efforts are felt to be unavailing , at least to embitter the hour of reception by all the most ungracious frowns of aversion and words of unwelcome . There has been enough of all this . It has had its fitting day during the period when , in common with every other possible question of practical policy that can arise , it unfortunately became one of the leading topics of party division , of presidential electioneering . But that period has passed , and with it let its prejudices and its passions , its discords and its denunciations , pass away too . The next session of Congress will see the representatives of the new young State in their places in both our halls of national legislation , side by side with those of the old Thirteen . Let their reception into \" the family \" be frank , kindly , and cheerful , as befits such an occasion , as comports not less with our own self - respect than patriotic duty towards them . Ill betide those foul birds that delight to file their own nest , and disgust the ear with perpetual discord of ill-omened croak . Why , were other reasoning wanting , in favor of now elevating this question of the reception of Texas into the Union , out of the lower region of our past party dissensions , up to its proper level of a high and broad nationality , it surely is to be found , found abundantly , in the manner in which other nations have undertaken to intrude themselves into it , between us and the proper parties to the case , in a spirit of hostile interference against us , for the avowed object of thwarting our policy and hampering our power , limiting our greatness and checking the fulfillment of our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions . This we have seen done by England , our old rival and enemy ; and by France , strangely coupled with her against us , under the influence of the Anglicism strongly tinging the policy of her present prime minister , Guizot . The zealous activity with which this effort to defeat us was pushed by the representatives of those governments , together with the character of intrigue accompanying it , fully constituted that case of foreign interference , which Mr. Clay himself declared should , and would unite us all in maintaining the common cause of our country against foreigner and the foe . We are only astonished that this effect has not been more fully and strongly produced , and that the burst of indignation against this unauthorized , insolent and hostile interference against us , has not been more general even among the party before opposed to Annexation , and has not rallied the national spirit and national pride unanimously upon that policy . We are very sure that if Mr. Clay himself were now to add another letter to his former Texas correspondence , he would express this sentiment , and carry out the idea already strongly stated in one of them , in a manner which would tax all the powers of blushing belonging to some of his party adherents . It is wholly untrue , and unjust to ourselves , the pretence that the Annexation has been a measure of spoliation , unrightful and unrighteous -- of military conquest under forms of peace and law -- of territorial aggrandizement at the expense of justice , and justice due by a double sanctity to the weak . This view of the question is wholly unfounded , and has been before so amply refuted in these pages , as well as in a thousand other modes , that we shall not again dwell upon it . The independence of Texas was complete and absolute . It was an independence , not only in fact , but of right . No obligation of duty towards Mexico tended in the least degree to restrain our right to effect the desired recovery of the fair province once our own -- whatever motives of policy might have prompted a more deferential consideration of her feelings and her pride , as involved in the question . If Texas became peopled with an American population ; it was by no contrivance of our government , but on the express invitation of that of Mexico herself ; accompanied with such guaranties of State independence , and the maintenance of a federal system analogous to our own , as constituted a compact fully justifying the strongest measures of redress on the part of those afterwards deceived in this guaranty , and sought to be enslaved under the yoke imposed by its violation . She was released , rightfully and absolutely released , from all Mexican allegiance , or duty of cohesion to the Mexican political body , by the acts and fault of Mexico herself , and Mexico alone . There never was a clearer case . It was not revolution ; it was resistance to revolution : and resistance under such circumstances as left independence the necessary resulting state , caused by the abandonment of those with whom her former federal association had existed . What then can be more preposterous than all this clamor by Mexico and the Mexican interest , against Annexation , as a violation of any rights of hers , any duties of ours ? We would not be understood as approving in all its features the expediency or propriety of the mode in which the measure , rightful and wise as it is in itself , has been carried into effect . Its history has been a sad tissue of diplomatic blundering . How much better it might have been managed -- how much more smoothly , satisfactorily , and successfully ! Instead of our present relations with Mexico -- instead of the serious risks which have been run , and those plausibilities of opprobrium which we have had to combat , not without great difficulty , nor with entire success -- instead of the difficulties which now throng the path to a satisfactory settlement of all our unsettled questions with Mexico -- Texas might , by a more judicious and conciliatory diplomacy , have been as securely in the Union as she is now -- her boundaries defined -- California probably ours -- and Mexico and ourselves united by closer ties than ever ; of mutual friendship and mutual support in resistance to the intrusion of European interference in the affairs of the American republics . All this might have been , we little doubt , already secured , had counsels less violent , less rude , less one - sided , less eager in precipitation from motives widely foreign to the national question , presided over the earlier stages of its history . We cannot too deeply regret the mismanagement which has disfigured the history of this question ; and especially the neglect of the means which would have been so easy of satisfying even the unreasonable pretensions and the excited pride and passion of Mexico . The singular result has been produced , that while our neighbor has , in truth , no real right to blame or complain -- when all the wrong is on her side , and there has been on ours a degree of delay and forbearance , in deference to her pretensions , which is to be paralleled by few precedents in the history of other nations -- we have yet laid ourselves open to a great deal of denunciation hard to repel , and impossible to silence ; and all history will carry it down as a certain fact , that Mexico would have declared war against us , and would have waged it seriously , if she had not been prevented by that very weakness which should have constituted her best defence . We plead guilty to a degree of sensitive annoyance -- for the sake of the honor of our country , and its estimation in the public opinion of the world -- which does not find even in satisfied conscience full consolation for the very necessity of seeking consolation there . And it is for this state of things that we hold responsible that gratuitous mismanagement - wholly apart from the main substantial rights and merits of the question , to which alone it is to be ascribed ; and which had its origin in its earlier stages , before the accession of Mr. Calhoun to the department of State . California probably , next fall away from the loose adhesion which , in such a country as Mexico , holds a remote province in a slight equivocal kind of dependence on the metropolis . Imbecile and distracted , Mexico never can exert any real governmental authority over such a country . The impotence of the one and the distance of the other , must make the relation one of virtual independence ; unless , by stunting the province of all natural growth , and forbidding that immigration which can alone develop its capabilities and fulfil the purposes of its creation , tyranny may retain a military dominion , which is no government in the , legitimate sense of the term . In the case of California this is now impossible . The Anglo - Saxon foot is already on its borders . Already the advance guard of the irresistible army of Anglo - Saxon emigration has begun to pour down upon it , armed with the plough and the rifle , and marking its trail with schools and colleges , courts and representative halls , mills and meeting - houses . A population will soon be in actual occupation of California , over which it will be idle for Mexico to dream of dominion . They will necessarily become independent . All this without agency of our government , without responsibility of our people -- in the natural flow of events , the spontaneous working of principles , and the adaptation of the tendencies and wants of the human race to the elemental circumstances in the midst of which they find themselves placed . And they will have a right to independence -- to self - government -- to the possession of the homes conquered from the wilderness by their own labors and dangers , sufferings and sacrifices -a better and a truer right than the artificial tide of sovereignty in Mexico , a thousand miles distant , inheriting from Spain a title good only against those who have none better . Their right to independence will be the natural right of self - government belonging to any community strong enough to maintain it -- distinct in position , origin and character , and free from any mutual obligations of membership of a common political body , binding it to others by the duty of loyalty and compact of public faith . This will be their title to independence ; and by this title , there can be no doubt that the population now fast streaming down upon California win both assert and maintain that independence . Whether they will then attach themselves to our Union or not , is not to be predicted with any certainty . Unless the projected railroad across the continent to the Pacific be carried into effect , perhaps they may not ; though even in that case , the day is not distant when the Empires of the Atlantic and Pacific would again flow together into one , as soon as their inland border should approach each other . But that great work , colossal as appears the plan on its first suggestion , cannot remain long unbuilt . Its necessity for this very purpose of binding and holding together in its iron clasp our fast-settling Pacific region with that of the Mississippi valley -- the natural facility of the route -- the ease with which any amount of labor for the construction can be drawn in from the overcrowded populations of Europe , to be paid in die lands made valuable by the progress of the work itself -- and its immense utility to the commerce of the world with the whole eastern Asia , alone almost sufficient for the support of such a road -- these coast of considerations give assurance that the day cannot be distant which shall witness the conveyance of the representatives from Oregon and California to Washington within less time than a few years ago was devoted to a similar journey by those from Ohio ; while the magnetic telegraph will enable the editors of the \" San Francisco Union , \" the \" Astoria Evening Post , \" or the \" Nootka Morning News , \" to set up in type the first half of the President 's Inaugural before the echoes of the latter half shall have died away beneath the lofty porch of the Capitol , as spoken from his lips . Away , then , with all idle French talk of balances of power on the American Continent . There is no growth in Spanish America ! Whatever progress of population there may be in the British Canadas , is only for their own early severance of their present colonial relation to the little island three thousand miles across the Atlantic ; soon to be followed by Annexation , and destined to swell the still accumulating momentum of our progress . And whosoever may hold the balance , though they should cast into the opposite scale all the bayonets and cannon , not only of France and England , but of Europe entire , how would it kick the beam against the simple , solid weight of the two hundred and fifty , or three hundred millions -- and American millions -- destined to gather beneath the flutter of the stripes and stars , in the fast hastening year of the Lord 1945 !"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

The massive explosion , thought to be caused by a fire that broke out at a storage facility containing explosive materials at the port of Beirut , has decimated large parts of the city , including many of the Beirut 's galleries , museums , and art centers . Gallery director Gaia Foudolian and prominent architect Jean - Marc Bonfils both died in the blast . The explosion flattened much of the port district and sent shockwaves that shattered windows and ceilings of buildings across the city . Beirut 's city governor Marwan Abboud said that up to 300,000 people have lost their homes because of the devastation . Lebanon 's President Michel Aoun said that a fire detonated 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate , a chemical component used in fertilizers and bombs . The chemical had been stored at the port unsafely since 2014 , according to officials . The explosion is now under investigation . This calamity comes after months of political unrest in Lebanon and a crippling economic crisis exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic . Many of the city 's leading art venues were damaged in the blast . Marfa ' Gallery and Galerie Tanit , both located close to Beirut 's Port , were hit hardest . Sfeir Semler Gallery , a gallery in the Karantina district north of the port , was also damaged . The gallery , a staple in Beirut 's art scene , represents world - renowned Lebanese artists like Etel Adnan , Walid Raad , and Akram Zaatari . Gaia Foudolian , the director of Letitia Gallery in the Hamra district , died in the explosion , her colleagues confirmed to Hyperallergic . Architect Jean- Marc Bonfils , who designed the East Village building which houses Galerie Tanit in the Mar Mikhael neighborhood , also died from the blast . A gallery employee was seriously wounded , according to her colleagues . The blast also hit major art institutions in the city like the Sursock Museum , Ashkal Alwan , the Arab Image Foundation , and the Beirut Art Center , among others . Zeina Arida , the director of the Sursock Museum , was at her office when the explosion shook the building shortly after 6 pm on Tuesday . \u201c Luckily , the museum closed 15 minutes before the blast , \u201d Arida told Hyperallergic in a phone conversation from Beirut , adding that no visitors or staff were hurt . The blast , she said , was \u201c incomparable to anything we have ever witnessed . \u201d The explosion shattered the museum 's doors , windows , skylights , and collapsed the ceilings of some of its rooms . It also damaged a large number of artworks in its permanent collection , including a valuable 1930 portrait of the museum 's founder Nicolas Sursock by Dutch painter Kees van Dongen . Two ceramics by the Lebanese - American artist Simone Fattal were completely destroyed , among many other items in the collection . \u201c At first , we feared it was bombing , and that there would be more to follow , so we stayed in the building , \u201d Arida described the moments after the explosion . \u201c We quickly realized how great the damage is . \u201d In the face of this massive destruction , art institutions in Beirut are helping each other to protect their collections .

Class 221 Voyager diesels were to have covered all the Holyhead - London workings ; four of these had been built as four - car sets rather than five - car for this purpose and allocated to the Virgin West Coast franchise , all other 221s being Virgin CrossCountry stock . It had become a railway tradition to refer to locos stationed around the network for rescue purposes ' Thunderbirds ' after the famous TV show , and Virgin took this one step further by arranging for the 57/3s to be named for characters in the series . Cleverly , the first five have the final digit of their numbers the same as the relevant character 's transport in the stories . 57 301 is Scott Tracy , who piloted Thunderbird 1 , etc. 57 307 Lady Penelope has pink- backed nameplates to match the colour of the lady 's Rolls - Royce . Our picture shows 57 311 Tin Tin fresh out of the Brush works at Loughborough . In Summer 2003 , during the process of creation of the 57/3s , a change of plan occurred ; legend has it that this was brought about by the desire of North Wales MPs for a full breakfast service when travelling to London , something that the small Class 221 galley could not offer . Two weekday return workings to London would therefore be Pendolinos , hauled by Class 57 / 3s between Holyhead and Crewe . The original order for locos was increased from 12 to 16 , and the fitting of a ' Dellner ' automatic coupler to the locos was hastily designed , so that the coupling and uncoupling at Crewe could be done more quickly than by using the 390 's emergency screw - coupling as had originally been envisaged for ' dragging ' and diversion work . After 12 locos , there were no Thunderbirds characters left to use for names , so places and things from the show were resorted to for the final four . By January 2004 we were reporting that the couplers were in process of fitting , and work was under way to modify the exhaust system of the locos to prevent diesel fumes entering the 390 's air - conditioning . At one time it was thought that the 57/3 might have to push the train , but eventually this was resolved . Then the whole plan nearly foundered as it was discovered that a Pendolino , with its pantograph in the lowered position , was too high for the ' structure gauge ' in North Wales , and Network Rail had to do some work to allow them to run . But after all these problems were overcome , Pendolino service did begin in Spring 2005 . The weekday turns were , at various times , supplemented by summer weekend operations to release Class 221s to relieve overcrowding elsewhere in Britain . The two weekday trains , and some weekend workings , continued as Pendolinos until the December 2008 timetable change , after which only a single Saturday - only Pendolino return working remained . This was suspended for a while , but from May 2009 began running again , to maintain staff familairity with the procedure . By 2008 Virgin Trains had found that they had too many locos for their requirements , even though they were already hiring them out for use on timber trains to Chirk . Arriva Trains Wales were being asked by the Welsh Assembly Government to provide a loco - hauled express from North Wales to Cardiff , and Virgin Trains successfully bid to supply the locos , to be driven by ATW drivers , who were given a referesher course , as ATW had used the ' Thunderbirds ' for a while a couple of years before . The last four locos , 313 - 316 were chosen , perhaps because their ' vehicle ' names ( Tracy Island , Firefly , The Mole , FAB 1 ) not match the ' character ' names of the other twelve . 57 314 and 57 315 were de-named and re-liveried in a new version of Arriva Trains Wales colours for use on the Monday - Friday express from Holyhead to Cardiff and return , which commenced on 15 December 2008 . 57 313 and 57 316 appeared shortly afterwards , de-named , in a so-called ' neutral ' livery - the same blue but minus the lighter parts , and the logos - and are supposedly used ' when the branded locos are unavailable ' ( although in practice they appeared just as often as the branded ones ) . The Arriva service was taken over by DB Schenker Class 67s from the evening working of 26 March 2012 . In 2010 57s were replaced by Colas Rail Class 66s on timber traffic to Chirk ; from December 2009 on they could be seen on First Great Western loco - hauled trains in south - west England , but were soon removed from this duty due to unreliability . In August 2011 , six of the locos were given up by Virgin for further use by Network Rail , and were repainted in NR 's all - yellow livery . Changes were made to their couplers to allow them to haul various types of electric railcars used in the south - east . The nameplates were removed for sale in a charity auction . In March 2012 three more locos were de-branded , this time for transfer to DRS , and received DRS blue livery . In 2014 , Network Rail decided to give up its locos , and all six have passed to DRS and gained its livery . As for the four Arriva blue ones 313 - 316 , at the start of 2013 they were sold to charter train operator West Coast Railway Company and when repainted have appeared in maroon livery ; they make occasional forays to North Wales on excursions . Farewell to North Wales At the December 2012 timetable change , marking the end of Virgin 's franchse term ( although an abnormal extension was awarded to the company following much - publicised fisaco relating to the award of the next franchise ) the story of Class 57s and Pendolinos come to an end as far as the normal working of the North Wales line is concerned . It was planned to replace the solitary Saturday train with a pair of Class 221 Voyagers after the workings of 8 December , but in view of a series of problems in previous weeks , culminating in a failure to establish a control connection between loco and train on 1 December resulting in passengers being transferred to a Voyager at Crewe , it was decided to begin Voyager service a week early on 8 December , to the dismay of railfans who had hoped for a last ride . The three 57/3 locos which remained allocated to Virgin and in their livery ( 307 , 308 , 311 ) transferred to the DRS fleet , and ceased to be the maintenance responsibilty of Alstom 's Manchester Longsight depot . All are expected to receive DRS livery . By 7 December it was reported that 57 307 had already been sent to Eastleigh Works . Interestingly when it emerged in DRS blue livery the pink ' Lady Penelope ' nameplates were retained - a nice gesture by DRS . In spring 2013 57 311 was re-named simply as ' Thunderbird ' with a standard style nameplate . In future provide the Class 57/3 locomotives for ' rescue ' duty are hired by Virgin from DRS , although staffed by Virgin drivers , and will normally be located at Euston , Rugby , Crewe , Preston and Carlisle stations . DRS locos are also likely to appear from time to time on passenger charter trains in North Wales and elsewhere .

Skip to Comments Topics : Environment , Nuclear Weapons , Science Driving south on Christmas Island 's lone north- south road , Tonga Fou and I are heading to the spot where , 50 years ago , the British military detonated a couple of thermonuclear weapons . Fou , 81 , smokes USA Gold Full Flavor 100 cigarettes . As he runs a leathery hand across his forehead , he recalls his experience during one of the test explosions . Crowded onto a military vessel in case of an emergency evacuation , Fou huddled with his wife and two children . The blast shook the boat , as if it had been shoved by a deity , and everyone winced as their ears popped . About a minute after the detonation , Fou wandered on deck , looked up and thought the world was coming to an end . \u201c It was just terrible , \u201d he says . \u201c The mushroom cloud was beginning to come up , with these bright colors , like breaking waves of fire , going up , bigger and bigger , until the sky was all red . \u201d Between 1957 and 1962 , this former British colony in the equatorial Pacific played involuntary host to 30 nuclear explosions conducted by the British and U.S. militaries . Code-named Operation Grapple , Britain 's tests at Christmas ( also known as Kiritimati ) and neighboring Malden Island ranged from a 3,000 - kiloton explosion 8,200 feet in the air and far out to sea , to a 24- kiloton \u201c balloon - suspended air burst over land . \u201d ( For comparison , the bomb dropped at Hiroshima had about a 15 - kiloton yield . ) With thousands of troops , weekly DDT spraying to keep fly populations at bay , and a steady stream of boats and airplanes delivering ever more provisions , it 's safe to say that the Cold War 's tenure on Christmas Island did n't exactly follow the mindful traveler 's dictum : Take only pictures , leave only footprints . But things change , even in places where WMD have inflicted their catastrophic toll . The Partial Test Ban Treaty , signed in 1963 , brought an end to U.S. and British testing in the region . In the ' 70s , the British government followed up at Christmas with Operation Hard Look , investigating whether radioactive fallout might be found on the island and , if so , determining what to do with it . They did n't find any , although there was no shortage of trash \u2014 abandoned vehicles and drums , mostly , decaying rapidly in the humid climate . In 1975 , American surveyors drew the same conclusion about lingering radioactivity . Still , for goodwill , to avoid future liability , or both , the British recently carried out a cleanup operation on Christmas , carting away tons of decades - old debris , most of which had been concentrated in a junkyard next to the village of Banana and totaled more than 30,000 cubic yards of material . Last May , the final shipment of waste was loaded onto a vessel bound for the U.K. Fou is the last living person on Christmas Island who was here when the nukes , nuke scientists and soldiers came to town . Now only fragments of that era remain : old truck tires stacked as a makeshift fence between village huts , concrete platforms where buildings once stood , a rotted wooden backboard on a metal pole \u2014 what was once a basketball hoop for recreating servicemen \u2014 and a crumbling church constructed of dead coral and concrete . What can be found in abundance , however , is nature . In the intervening decades since the era of nuclear - weapons testing , the natural world has quietly rebounded . Today , Christmas Island , Bikini Atoll and other Cold War proving grounds , like Monte Bello north of Perth , Australia , constitute some of the most ecologically intact corners of the world , emitting not radiation but a peculiar allure ; it 's atomic tourism with a naturalist spin . Marine biologists diving at Bikini have returned with glowing reports . Inspecting a mile - wide crater left by a hydrogen bomb that exploded with a force 1,000 times greater than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima , researchers recently found the lagoon to be 80 percent covered by thriving corals , with some species growing into huge , treelike formations . Karen Koltes , a coral specialist with the U.S. Department of the Interior , says reefs around places like Bikini \u201c are among the few examples left in the world of what an ecosystem looks like absent human presence and exploitation . \u201d ( Unintentionally pouring on the irony , scientists will sometimes employ the word \u201c pristine . \u201d ) This nature - despite - nukes contrast can be seen at other former test sites , such as the waters surrounding Alaska 's Amchitka Island where , 40 years ago , the U.S. conducted three underground explosions . The same is true of the desolate dunes of a former French test site in Algeria , and even the scrublands inside the fence at the Nevada Test Site . Radioactive materials are long - lasting , which is what makes them both scary and misunderstood . The smoke detectors in your home likely contain a radionuclide called americium . But the reason to worry about them has nothing to do with radioactive material and everything to do with whether the detector 's battery is working . Contrary to popular belief , previously bombed geographies are not transformed into lifeless , poisoned landscapes for the next 50,000 years . Hiroshima and Nagasaki look just like every other bustling Japanese city , and crawling around in the grass of a city park there is no different than doing so in Seattle or Milan , Italy , or Auckland , New Zealand , at least as far as radiation hazard is concerned . But that 's not to say everything is peachy with former nuke test sites . Radioactive fallout , and the dizzyingly complex study of it , depends on factors such as microclimates , local geography , wind , altitude of detonation , size of the bomb and environmental conditions on the ground like soils , rock type and vegetation . There are places in the Pacific you do n't want to go and probably ca n't \u2014 that 's why they 're off limits . The same is true for parts of the Nevada Test Site and other detonation locations . On or around once - pummeled Pacific Islands , the matter of harmful radiation depends on where you go and whom you ask . Christmas Island , as far as anyone can tell , was always safe from radioactivity , thanks to winds that carried fallout out to sea . And in the ocean \u2014 not just around Christmas but anywhere \u2014 radioactive materials dilute quickly , rendering them essentially harmless . It 's when they 're concentrated that they can be dangerous . At places like Bikini and Rongelap Atolls in the Marshall Islands , the picture gets murkier . In the 1950s , the locals on Rongelap watched fallout , delivered on the wind , sprinkle down from above like snow . ( And this from a people who had never seen snow . ) The islanders were evacuated , only to return and then evacuate again years later because of renewed fears about perceived radiation hazards . Today , the people of Rongelap are planning to resettle their homeland yet again . The government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands wants the U.S. to cough up money and medical support for cancers caused and damage done during the era of nuclear testing . The U.S. says a previous settlement of $ 150 million should have done the trick , and this conflict remains a contentious one , at least for the Marshallese . As for existing radiation hazard , U.S. and independent scientists say there is none , although you would n't want to dine month after month on certain local plants that accumulate radioactive material . Still , it 's one thing to accept government reports declaring that a place once used for thermonuclear target practice is fallout - free and not hazardous to one 's health . It 's quite another thing to travel there on vacation . Geiger counter in hand , I hopped off the skiff and onto the coral beach at the tiny island of Motu Tabu , inside the lagoon at Christmas Island . Rain showers gave way to a mix of billowing clouds and hammering equatorial sunshine . The cacophony from the seabird colony intensified as I approached , but the thousands of noddy and sooty terns did not leave their posts , standing guard over black - speckled eggs . Encountering animals so unaccustomed to human visitors , I thought of Darwin in the Galapagos . I switched on the Geiger counter and squinted at the digital display . The readings were minuscule \u2014 0.008 , 0.003 , 0.006 milli-Roentgens per hour \u2014 numbers indicating nothing more than background radiation from the sun , and noticeably lower than the background radiation levels one would find in a typical American city . For an unconventional island adventure away from it all , Bikini may have the name recognition , but Christmas is easier for most Americans to get to \u2014 just a three - hour flight from Honolulu . The largest coral atoll on the planet , Christmas is 124 square miles of land , set in the shape of a globular crucifix , with two spits at the northern end enclosing a lagoon . ( The island first became known to the Western world when Capt. James Cook discovered it on Christmas Eve , 1777 . ) The island is perfectly \u2014 no , ridiculously \u2014 flat . The highest point is a 35 - foot-high mound , Joe 's Hill , erected by a British serviceman who was bulldozing coral and tar sands to construct the road that runs the length of the island . According to one account , he made the miniature hill as a perch for camping , preferring the seaside solitude to the military barracks . The rest of the island setting is made up of palm trees , a ubiquitous plant called saltbush , inedible crabs skittering everywhere , and sun that will burn you through a T-shirt . In 1979 , the British ceded possession of the island , and Christmas became the easternmost outpost of the scattered island nation of Kiribati . Straddling the international dateline , the country covers an area of the Pacific Ocean equal to that of the continental U.S. , even though the tiny islands together total 311 square miles . The island 's 5,000 residents subsist on international aid , tropical fish exports and scarce tourist dollars . They live in tiny villages composed of huts and yards patched together with tin , palm -thatched roofs and pigs roaming streets littered with rusting corned beef cans . The splendor of this place is out on , and in , the water . Fly- fishing enthusiasts who come to Christmas are on a pilgrimage to stalk the elusive , torpedo - fast and deceptively strong bonefish . Christmas is home to the largest bonefishing flats in the world , shallow waters in which the fish feed on tiny shrimp , sometimes revealing their whereabouts by nosing into the sand and extending their sparkling silvery tails above the waterline . When I called one fly - fishing expert who had been to Christmas to ask for a few travel tips , he said , \u201c If you go there without a fishing rod , you should be shot . \u201d Vacationing anglers , decked out in $ 100 UV - protective shirts , long - billed hats and polarized sunglasses , carrying in their rod setup and tackle cases another $ 1,500 worth of gear , spend upward of 10 hours a day wading in the calf - deep waters of the lagoon , casting shrimp - shaped flies toward their prey . The visiting sport-fishermen are so essential to the barely extant island economy that locals are , at least on paper , forbidden from eating the bonefish . ( Inedible in the eyes of most Westerners , bonefish are part of the islanders ' regular menu . ) But some non-fishing - obsessed travelers do manage to make their way to Christmas . One morning , paddling kayaks on the far side of the lagoon , Garry and Kerry Phillips of Brisbane , Australia , were delighted to spend an afternoon in a place where they did n't see another soul for hours \u2014 only manta rays gliding through the shallows . Having traveled and scuba-dived throughout the Pacific and points beyond , they were stunned by the quality of what they saw on the island of nuclear detonations . \u201c When we were looking into this trip , I did consider the weapons , \u201d recalls Garry . \u201c I wondered if it might look like a concrete wasteland or something . \u201d But after a week spent kayaking in the aquamarine flats , snorkeling among kaleidoscopic reef fish , and then , at the seabird colony , appreciating the chance to spot rare bird species such as the phoenix petrel and red-footed booby , Phillips laughed at his pre-trip preconceptions . \u201c The contrast of it is amazing . I mean , the hydrogen bomb is the most powerful and destructive thing there is , right ? Yet out here , this place , and the reefs we saw yesterday \u2014 it 's just gorgeous . \u201d"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

It was a rare phenomenon that subsided after the sharks dispersed .

This week I e-mailed longtime resident and fly-fishing guide Ed Kunze to see how things were , and he said they 're fine for tourists but a bloody mess on the drug war front . Kunze said during the past month at least 15 people were killed in drug war violence . A police commander killed in a grenade attack was related to Kunze 's wife , Rebecca , whose mother witnessed the gunning down of a policeman as he was leaving his house . Kunze said the main route through the area , Highway 200 , is \" the only route that the narcos can take their product overland to get to the north \" and that some of that product , marijuana and opium poppies , are grown in Guerrero 's mountain villages . \" A cartel needs to have exclusive rights to a crop of a village , and it needs to be able to get it moved north , \" Kunze added . But the construction contractor / fly - fishing guide stressed that those who are n't involved in the drug trade or in the war with cartels are not affected . \" Just use common sense , \" Kunze advised . \" Do not go out late at night to strip joints , high - profile bars or discos , where young men with a lot of money to flash around would hang out . I would not want to be in one of these locations if two rival factions were there at the same time . \" As for bull sharks , Kunze said there have been no reports of attacks or sightings by surfers .

Mass thought , mass movements , mass media . Americans casually discussed \u201c the lonely crowd \u201d and \u201c the organization man . \u201d But one book saw the masses for what they were \u2013 disillusioned and desperate . The True Believer was hailed as \u201c brilliant and original . \u201d The book captivated philosophers , political scientists , even presidents . Who was this insightful author ? In what university did he teach ? Finally , someone him found him \u2014 on the docks of San Francisco , loading freight . Eric Hoffer spoke with a gruff German accent , but he was an American original . He never traveled outside the country . Orphaned at eighteen , he \u201c wandered up and down the land , dodging hunger and grieving over the world . \u201d He pondered suicide , survived Skid Row , and worked as a field hand , dishwasher , longshoreman . Yet he kept his faith in America , and shared it . Hoffer , said CBS ' newsman Eric Sevareid , \u201c made millions of confused and troubled Americans feel very much better about their country . He showed them again the old truths about America and why they remain alive and valid . \u201d All writers live for ideas but Eric Hoffer lived with them . He had no siblings , wife , or family . His sad but inspiring life made Hoffer himself a true believer \u2014 in truth . Hoffer claimed he was born in the Bronx at the turn of the century , but there was no birth certificate , no census record . More certain was the signature moment in his childhood when his mother , carrying him down the stairs , fell . Elsa Hopper never recovered , dying two years later . Her son soon went blind . For eight years , Hoffer lived deep inside his darkness . When he recovered his eyesight , fear of recurring blindness gave Hoffer , who never spent a day in school , an insatiable appetite for reading . A few years later , when his father died , Hoffer threw himself into America . Throughout the 1920s , he lived in L.A. , working odd jobs , living in tenements , reading , reading . From stacks of index cards scribbled with quotes , he culled his philosophy . During the Depression , he again hit the road , working in California 's vast farm fields . In every town where he picked crops , he had a library card . \u201c My writing is done in railroad yards while waiting for a freight , \u201d he said , \u201c in the fields while waiting for a truck , and at noon after lunch . Towns are too distracting . \u201d In 1938 , Hoffer sent an article about tramps to a magazine . The magazine turned it down , but the editor kept in touch . A decade later , settled in San Francisco , Hoffer sent the woman a hand - written manuscript . She typed it , submitted it , and in 1951 , The True Believer : Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements was published . Its author was a middle - aged longshoreman hailed by the New York Times as \u201c a genius against insuperable odds , capable of amazing insights into history . \u201d So who was Hoffer 's True Believer ? In the age of Hitler , Stalin , and Mao , he was the fresh convert to a cult of personality . \u201c The true believer is everywhere on the march , \u201d Hoffer wrote . But tyrants , he cautioned , do not rule solely by coercion . True believers surrender their independence because it has gotten them nowhere . Disillusioned and defeated , they follow promises of greatness en masse . Fascism . Communism . Nationalism . Believe . Join . Trust us . \u201c The less justified a man is in claiming excellence for his own self , \u201d Hoffer wrote , \u201c the more ready he is to claim all excellence for his nation , his religion , his race or his holy cause . \u201d Hmmm . The True Believer made Hoffer 's name but not much money . He published more books \u2014 The Passionate State of Mind , The Ordeal of Change \u2014 but kept his job on the docks . On into the 1960s , he walked daily in Golden Gate Park , stopping to write in notebooks . Living alone in a small flat with no phone , no TV , he courted ideas . \u201c I get the longshoremen mad when I say , ' You know , I ca n't think of anything more exciting than going to bed with a half - finished paragraph . ' \u201d Amidst growing acclaim , Hoffer taught classes at Berkeley and wrote a syndicated column . LBJ consulted with him . Journalists sought his opinions . Finally , in 1967 , Hoffer quit working and withdrew from public life . ' I 'm going to crawl back into my hole where I started , \u201d he said . \u201c I do n't want to be a public person or anybody 's spokesman . . . Any man can ride a train . Only a wise man knows when to get off . \u201d Hoffer died in 1983 . He left behind nine books and 100 + notebooks now at Stanford 's Hoover Institute . But he also left a unique understanding of charismatic leaders and the followers who trade reason for blind faith . True believers , it seems , are still on the march and the longshoreman-philosopher can help us understand them . \u201c Power corrupts the few , while weakness corrupts the many , \u201d Hoffer wrote . \u201c Hatred , malice , rudeness , intolerance , and suspicion are the faults of weakness . \u201d"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

( AP ) -- Patrick White showed there 's more to West Virginia 's offense than just handing off to Steve Slaton . White threw for a personal - best 216 yards and two touchdowns and ran for another score , and the No. 4 Mountaineers overcame Slaton 's least - productive game of the season and pulled away late in a 27 - 10 victory over East Carolina on Saturday night . \" I guess we can throw it around a little bit , \" White said . \" They did a good job of defending the run . Their safeties came down , defended the run well . \" White was 17 - of - 24 passing with touchdown passes of 3 yards to Owen Schmitt and 60 yards to Darius Reynaud . The Mountaineers ( 4 - 0 ) shook off some sloppy play -- including White 's three interceptions -- to win their 11th straight game . \" I go back to a few years ago , when we were mad at certain wins if we did n't think we won by enough , \" coach Rich Rodriguez said . \" I 'm not going to be that way . \" The Pirates held Slaton , who entered as the nation 's third - leading rusher , to 80 yards -- less than half of his 168 - yard average -- and afterward he said he was bothered by cramps blamed on the hot , humid weather . \" They came in very prepared , and we were in their yard , \" Slaton said . \" We ca n't have the best games every week . There 's going to be times you get stopped , and that 's what happened today . \" West Virginia entered as the nation 's top rushing team and hoped to roll up big numbers again on an East Carolina defense that ranked among the worst in Conference USA against the run . But coach Skip Holtz 's Pirates refused to allow the Mountaineers to run wild , leaving it up to White to make the big plays . West Virginia led just 17 - 10 early in the fourth quarter when White flipped a pass to Reynaud , who zigzagged 60 yards back across the field and through the Pirates ' defense for the clinching touchdown . \" That was a good gut check for us , \" Rodriguez said . Reynaud finished with five catches for 110 yards and became the first West Virginia player with more than 100 yards receiving since November 2004 , when Chris Henry had 118 against Boston College . West Virginia needed big passing numbers because East Carolina derailed the Mountaineers ' ground game for the second straight year . \" We probably pressed a little bit too much , \" Rodriguez said . The Mountaineers had just 153 yards rushing -- 197 fewer than its nation - leading average of 350 ; a year ago , East Carolina held West Virginia to just 127 yards rushing . James Pinkney was 20 - of - 40 for 247 yards with a touchdown for the Pirates ( 1 - 3 ) , and Aundrae Allison had four catches for 54 yards and a touchdown . But East Carolina could n't get its ground game going , either -- Brandon Fractious led the Pirates with 13 yards rushing , and the Pirates finished with 41 yards on the ground . \" We have to start running the ball to win games , \" Holtz said . \" We ca n't put the quarterback back there and have everyone know what we 're doing and let him continue to take the shots he 's taking . \" West Virginia dominated the first half , holding three - touchdown underdog East Carolina to 2 yards rushing and gaining 221 yards to the Pirates ' 87 , but led just 14 - 7 at halftime largely because of two interceptions thrown by White in the end zone . White capped West Virginia 's opening drive with a 5 - yard touchdown run , then flipped his scoring pass to Schmitt early in the second quarter to snap a 7 - all tie . Pinkney found his favorite target -- Allison -- behind the West Virginia defense for a 47 - yard touchdown pass midway through the first , tying it 7 - 7 . Pat McAfee had field goals of 26 and 29 yards in the second half for West Virginia . The Pirates closed to seven points early in the fourth on Robert Lee 's 27 - yard field goal . \" It 's frustrating to watch a team play that hard and improve as much as they have in some areas but continue to come up short , \" Holtz said .

Please visit www.Hendersonville.com for the latest news , events , and more . As part of North Carolina 's statewide celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Wright Brothers ' flight , Smith - McDowell House Museum will host a special exhibit , \" Kiffin Rockwell and the Lafayette Escadrille , \" from April 17 through August 24 , 2003 . Developed by the Museum , this exhibit showcases the important role Kiffin Rockwell and the French Foreign Legion 's Lafayette Escadrille played in the advancement of the early days of military aviation . Kiffin Yates Rockwell , born September 20 , 1892 , in Newport , Tennessee , moved to Asheville with his widowed mother , older brother , and younger sister in 1906 . As a young child , he attended the Orange Street School . Always considered handsome , intelligent , and adventurous by those who knew him , he was well educated , attending Virginia Military Institute and Washington and Lee University before leaving his educational career behind , along with his brother Paul , for a career in advertising in Atlanta . But adventure was calling , and the family 's French roots had always intrigued the brothers . So , when France found itself fighting for its very existence in World War I - prior to the United States ' entry into the war - both Kiffin and Paul volunteered for the French Foreign Legion ( the legendary French Foreign Legion , still active today , accepts foreign nationals in military service for France ) . Following service in the trenches with the infantry - during which both Paul and Kiffin received gunshot injuries that required extended recovery - Kiffin , along with six other Americans , formed the Escadrille Americaine , an airplane fighter unit that was later expanded to include thirty - one American aces and renamed the Lafayette Escadrille . Kiffin Rockwell became an overnight international sensation when he became the first American pilot to shoot down a German airplane in a dogfight in the skies over Alsace , France , on May 18 , 1916 , only five days after the unit flew its first mission . For his actions , Rockwell was awarded the Medaille Militaire and the Croix de Guirre . Rockwell was dogged in his pursuit of German enemy planes - in spite of being wounded in the face with an explosive bullet from an enemy airplane on May 26 , 1916 , he refused treatment in a French hospital and continued to fly . Unfortunately , Rockwell 's remaining days of heroism were few . On September 23 , 1916 , only four short months after his first enemy engagement , Rockwell was shot and killed over France , only two miles from where he had scored his first enemy kill . He was buried in France two days later with full military honors . He was awarded posthumously the Cross of the Legion of Honor . He was only 24 at the time of his death . Rockwell family home in Asheville was on Hillside Street , off the west side of Merrimon Avenue . A North Carolina historic sign marks the site . The Smith - McDowell House Museum is located at 283 Victoria Road in Asheville on the campus of AB Tech . The Museum is open Tuesday through Saturday , 10 AM -4 PM , and on Sunday from 1 - 4PM . Admission is $ 5 adults , $ 4 seniors and students , and $ 3 for ages 5 - 18 . Children under 5 are admitted free .

Black , a Detroit native , has already hit stadiums around the country on the sold - out I Am Music II tour with Lil 'Wayne , Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross . You recently wrapped up a sold - out run with Lil Wayne . What 's it like to be back home after being on the road for so long ? It feels so good . I was so excited to lay on my bed ! It 's been nice . I 'm getting to see all my friends again . Not to sound like a stalker here , but you just tweeted a picture of your bed . Tell me about some of the things hanging on your wall . I have this friend that does artwork and he did the photo of me with a gas mask and the Ol' Dirty Bastard one . I have this weird painting of a cow and a silver horse head with a Barbie riding it . I just have all sorts of weird , random stuff . My whole apartment is randomly out of control . Tell me what you 're like on stage . I noticed you tour with a full band . How 's that going over live ? I 've got a full band and two back - up dancers . We 've been getting a great reaction from people . I 'm excited . People are getting into it and they 're not really familiar with the music yet . Is life on the road something that 's easy for you to get used to ? It 's a lot of fun . Everybody on the whole tour is like family . It 's like one big party \u2013 hanging out with everybody , getting dressed up , playing shows and doing what we love to do . I 'm into it . Getting to see the country is interesting . I 'll tell you a secret here . Most people think of me as a metalhead or the rocker guy , but I quietly own every Britney Spears CD . When I first saw you and heard the single I thought , \u201c Holy shit ! It 's about time I heard something like this ! \u201d The attitude is through the roof ! Tell me a little about yourself and how Porcelain Black came to be . I 've been working in music for a while . I had a deal with Virgin Records originally and that ended up not working out . That project was called Porcelain and the Tramps . They did n't understand the vision of what we were going for . I 've had this vision for a long time . I 've always said if Britney Spears and Marilyn Manson fucked and had a kid then it would be me ! I tried to explain that to the people at Virgin and they just did n't get it . They wanted me to do an Avril Lavigne pop thing . I 'm doing music I love and this is the kind of music I love to write . I ended up meeting Red One and we started working on the record . We clicked right away and he totally got the vision . He was into it . We went in the studio and the first song we did was \u201c This Is What Rock N Roll Looks Like . \u201d Red is a total metalhead at heart , too . He used to have long hair and play in metal bands and stuff . After watching the video for \u201c This Is What Rock N Roll Looks Like , \u201d I 'm just curious what you were like in high school . Did you carry this same attitude with you then ? I only went to high school until I was 15 . I got kicked out of two high schools in three months . I faked being home schooled online until I was 16 because you ca n't legally drop out until then . My hair was always crazy , different colors . I 'm pretty much the same now . I had a mohawk . It was black and blue , then it was red . I do n't think I 've changed too much . I 've always known who I was from the beginning . I 'm still that way ! ( laughs ) I was pretty out of control when I was younger . My mom was like , \u201c Oh god , I hate my life ! My daughter is such a psycho ! \u201d ( laughs ) Your dad was a hairdresser so he at least got to help you color your hair , right ? Yeah , yeah ! It 's funny because my mom is super-straight and is an accountant for a living . My dad was a hairdresser and played in a band and was super rock 'n roll . I know you want to hit as many people as you can with your music but what audience is going to grab onto it first ? There are so many directions it could go . I do n't know . Hopefully all different kinds of people dig it . I guess we 'll just have to wait and see . Hopefully rockers and metalheads will like it and the pop kids will like it , too . Do you do your own songwriting ? I did every song on the record with Red One except for one song called \u201c How Do You Love Someone \u201d that I did with Billy Steinberg . I write all my own stuff . I do n't understand artists that do n't write their own songs . I 'm thankful for artists like Britney , but I do n't understand how you ca n't write your own music . It 's such a personal way of expressing yourself . You 're fresh off the road now . Who are some people you 'd like to tour with ? I would like to tour with Britney . I think touring with Marilyn Manson would be dope . I think it would be fun to tour with New Kids On The Block . I would love to tour with AC / DC . That would be tight ! I love them . Rock 'n roll to me is about having a good time , being with your friends \u2013 a very positive thing . How do you see rock 'n roll ? It 's about being a badass and still being a good person . I feel like there is a lot of miscommunication when it comes to rock 'n roll . You do n't have to have that \u201c fuck you \u201d attitude . It should n't be like that . Rock 'n roll is about embracing everybody and having fun . The more the merrier and the better the party is going to be ! Rock 'n roll is about being casual and not giving a fuck . When you start giving a fuck and thinking you 're too good for people \u2013 that 's just wack ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Their construction was put to a halt for the projects , most of them hydro - or thermal power plants , failed to have an environmental impact assessment according to law . All would have obvious environmental consequences if no measure is taken to curb their possible hazardous impact , so an advanced assessment on their environmental impact is necessary according to law . However , construction of these projects was launched without proper environmental assessment before hand . Hailed by media and the public as \" an environmental storm , \" SEPA 's act to halt their construction marked a departure from its old image as a rubberstamp of such wrongdoings . \" We are determination to investigate and punish any violations of environmental laws and environmental assessment is never a rubber stamp , \" says Pan Yue , deputy -director of SEPA . Interestingly , the top three on the \" black list \" were all hydro - power plants under China 's Three Gorges Project Company , which claims millions yuan of government input as key projects to alleviate the country 's energy plight and hinges on the same administrative level with SEPA . So the unprecedented campaign certainly incurred great pressure on SEPA . Yet the move won the praise from Premier Wen Jiabao , who openly applauded SEPA 's campaign at a State Council conference . Also backing the move were more than 50 environmental non-governmental organizations ( NGOs ) , which have enthusiastically responded by co-signing a public letter to welcome the act . Although one month later , most of the 30 halted projects resumed their construction , reportedly having passed the environmental assessment , the act that these key projects ' construction was ever suspended made a history , says an official of SEPA . SEPA alone can never guarantee the full enforcement of environmental laws and regulations , observes Prof . Wang Canfa , director of the center to help environmental victims at China University of Political Sciences and Law . In fact , according to Wang , the rate of China 's environmental laws and regulations that are actually enforced is estimated to be barely 10 percent . For instance , he notes , China 's criminal law that includes clear stipulations on crimes of serious environmental accidents took effect in 1997 . In the following five years the country recorded at least 50 serious environmental accidents a year based on official estimation , but to date no more than 20 people have been held accountable . \" This is what happens with the enforcement of criminal law that deals with the most serious cases of environmental accidents in the legal system , and you can imagine what happens to other environmental laws , \" laments Prof . Wang . A joint investigation by SEPA and Ministry of Land and Resources in 2004 shows that 30 to 40 percent of the mining construction projects went through the procedure of environment impact assessment as required , while in some areas only 6 to 7 percent did so . This partly explains why China has witnessed so many mining accidents in recent years . Wang and his colleagues started to offer legal assistance to the victims of environmental accidents five years ago , and the biggest obstacle remains in the \" environment \" to enforce law . Last year , Wang recalls , he tried to help a local fisherman in southwestern China 's Chongqing , who went bankrupt as his fish farm was poisoned by the waste water discharged into the river from a local chemical plant . The fisherman sued the chemical plant with help from Wang . But a judge from the county court told Wang matter - of - factly that a county leader had made phone calls asking favor for the chemical plant , which set the tone of verdict even before the trial . The reason was simple : the chemical plant turns is a major contributor to the local revenue . China 's central government has embraced the \" scientific approach to development , \" which emphasizes the balance between economic development and environmental sustainability . But some local officials still prioritize GDP growth over environmental protection , partly due to the current evaluation system of political performance , says a senior official from SEPA on condition of anonymity . The evaluation system is being re-structured by introducing the new concept of green GDP , which would calculate the environmental and ecological cost along with the economic growth , and the achievements may be offset if the cost is too dear . SEPA and the Organizational Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China , which is in charge of Party officials ' promotion , are studying how to incorporate environmental parameters into evaluating an official 's performance , such as overall environmental quality based on public survey , quality of air and drinking water , forest coverage and so on . While the \" economy - goes - first \" mentality lingers on the minds of many local officials , environmental departments are expected to be watchdogs to form some counter - balance . But this is not easy to realize in reality , as local environmental protection bureaus remain part of the local government , which controls their budget and staff , instead of reporting directly to SEPA . \" When you are opposed to a project out of environmental concerns , you have to think of the possible consequence , as your boss is certainly not in favor of your objection , \" says the SEPA official . To change this situation , reforms in power structure have been started on a trial basis . For two years the provincial environmental protection administration of Shaanxi in northwestern China has required the local environmental bureaus at city and county levels to directly report to the provincial administration instead of local governments , so as to guarantee their independence to enforce environmental laws and regulations despite local administrative interventions . Similar experiments have been carried out for the past ten years in dozens of large and medium - sized cities nationwide , such as Dalian , Ningbo and Xiamen . Further steps are being considered for SEPA , the theoretically highest body to enforce environmental laws and regulations , to set up monitoring mechanism directly at major sites of significant ecological or geographical values , lest local bureaus fail to function as they should . An encouraging progress in China 's enforcement of environmental laws lies in the greater public participation , evidenced by the emergence of environmental NGOs as among the most active players in China 's growing civil society . Domestic organizations like Friends of Nature have successfully launched high - profile environmental awareness campaigns among the general public for years , while international activist groups like Greenpeace have been whistle - blowing about grave environmental damages caused by multi-national companies in China . On the individual level , more and more victims have resorted to law thanks to help from professionals like Prof . Wang and his colleagues . The fisherman from Chongqing remains unbeaten even though the local judge would not support him . \" I 'm going to appeal my case to the highest court in Beijing if local courts fail to do me justice , \" he claims . \" If Beijing also fails me , I 'm going to bring my case to the United Nations ' Environment Program ! \""}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Filipino settlements were established in Louisiana as early as 1765.1 The early Filipino population was exclusively male and intermarried with local women , including Indian women . 2 During the 19th century , large numbers of Chinese and Filipinos came to the United States to work on plantations and railroads . Modern descendants recount the marriage of Hilario Hongo , a Chinese farm worker who arrived in Louisiana via Cuba in 1867 , and Azelie Phillip , an Indian woman . 3 Some other Filipino and Chinese laborers who remained in the U.S. were adopted into Indian nations and intermarried with Native women . Their descendants are counted among Indians . Filipinos worked as crew members aboard whaling ships which wintered in Alaska in the 1850s . Research from the Alaska Historical Commission reveals the oral tradition of the Inupiat Eskimos to contain words picked up from Filipinos . 4 Alaskan fish canneries saw an influx of thousands of Filipino workers during the 1920s and the decades following . Filipino American communities grew in the coastal villages of Southwestern , Southcentral and Southeastern Alaska when some of these cannery workers stayed and married Alaskan Native women . Their children have been among stockholders in the Native corporations established by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 . Some of these second - generation Pinoys , Filipino - Alaskan Natives , had taken leadership roles in the Native corporations . 5 Filipino men came to the West Coast in the 1920s and 1930s , to fill the labor shortage caused by immigration bans against Chinese and Japanese . On Bainbridge Island , WA , many of these immigrants settled down with Native American women . Their descendants celebrate their unique heritage in the annual Bainbridge Island Indipino Festival . 6 Born Bernie Reyes to a Filipino immigrant father and indigenous Indian mother , Bernie Whitebear grew up in poverty on the Colville Indian Reservation in Eastern Washington , and eventually worked at Boeing as an engineer . His parents later separated and his mother remarried a Chinese American . Bernie took on the name Whitebear in honor of his maternal grandfather , and became a prominent leader among Seattle 's Indians . In 1970 , he founded the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation . In the same year , UIATF occupied Fort Lawton in Seattle , which was originally Indian land . This effort received the support of non-Indians , including Filipino American activist Bob Santos . 7 UIATF and the city eventually reached an agreement for a 99 - year lease on a parcel of land in the former Fort Lawton . The land was used to build an Indian cultural center which also provided educational and social services . Whitebear passed away in 2000 . He was survived by siblings Luana Reyes , Teresa Wong , Laura Wong Whitebear , Lawney Reyes and Harry Wong .

The literary appelation of Kim Pusik was Noech '\u00f3n ( Thunder River ) , and his style was lpji ( Establisher ) . He was the son of Kim K\u00fan , a public official . In 1097 , together with his brothers , Kim Pusik qualified in the government entrance examination on the Book of Documents . In 1115 Kim was appointed to a junior position in the Office of Remonstrance . He held positions of gradually increasing responsibility until 1124 , when he was made fourth secretary of the Board of Rites . Two years later he rose to the position of assistant inspector general . Late in 1126 Kim was dispatched as an envoy to Sung China , which was under great pressure from the J\u00fcrchen troops of Wu-ch'i-mai , the second ruler of the newly founded state of Chin in Manchuria . The Chin had superseded the Khitan Liao as the power in Manchuria and were succeeding in devasting the northern areas of Sung when envoys from Sung arrived to request Kory\u00f3 aid in dealing with the usurpers . Kim was entrusted with the task of evaluating the true situation before Kory\u00f3 would make a firm commitment ; however , when Kim 's mission reached Ming-chou , they were forced to turn back by the J\u00fcrchen . Eventually Kory\u00f3 was forced to accept nominal Chin suzerainty instead of the normal tributary relationship with Sung . Upon his return Kim was made third minister of finance and then chancellor of the National Academy in 1128 . In 1134 Kim was made field marshal and put in charge of the nation 's armies to put down a rebellion in P'y\u00f3ngyang led by the monk Myo Ch'ong , who had declared himself emperor . After putting down the rebels and restoring the Kory\u00f3 authority , Kim was rewarded for his service with grandiose titles and lands . Late in 1136 his younger brother Puch '\u00f3l , who had fought with him against the rebels , died . In 1145 Kim finished the work on his History of the Three Kingdoms ( Samguk sagi ) , which was the earliest Korean official history . In 1148 he was enfeoffed as \" Marquis - Who-Established - Loyang \" ( Nangnang ) , and he retired from public service a short time later . Kim died , 3 years after his retirement , at the age of 76 . He was given the posthumous title of Muny\u00f3l ( Grand Word ) . S\u00f3gy\u00f3ng Rebellion The monk Myo Ch'ong , who is invariably given the epithet \" vicious monk \" in the Korean records , came from S\u00f3gy\u00f3ng ( Western Capital ) , modern P'y\u00f3ngyang . Representing P'y\u00f3ngyang interests , he tried to persuade King Injong to move the capital from Songdo ( Kaes\u00f3ng ) to P'y\u00f3ngyang . He argued that the geomantic considerations involved were so propitious that the King would surely be enabled to become the ruler over all Manchuria and perhaps China as well from his new capital . Kim and his brothers were in the forefront of those who vehemently opposed Myo Ch'ong 's power play . When it became evident that he would not gain his concessions , Myo Ch'ong returned to P'y\u00f3ngyang and , together with Cho Kwang and others , he rebelled against Injong and declared himself emperor of Tawi . Kim Pusik and his brother Puch'\u00f3l , a general , were dispatched to punish the rebels . The armies under Kim made quick progress north to P'y\u00f3ngyang , and Cho Kwang , in an effort to save himself , beheaded Myo Ch'ong and offered surrender for pardon . Cho 's offer was refused , and it was nearly a year before P'y\u00f3ngyang again came under the royal standard . \" History of the Three Kingdoms \" Kim 's monumental work , History of the Three Kingdoms , was published in 1145 in 50 chapters . It is the earliest officially sanctioned Korean history . The title and the history itself were modeled upon the Shih-chi of Ssu-ma Ch'ien , which became the model for later Chinese official histories . The Shih-chi , in 130 chapters , was completed before 90 B.C. and was divided into sections \u2014 annals , chronologies , treatises , and biographies ; this is the form that Kim Pusik utilized . The first 12 chapters of Kim 's work record the annals of the kingdom of Silla . The next 10 chapters cover the kingdom of Kogury\u00f3 . The final 6 chapters of the section of annals are devoted to the kingdom of Paekje . The section of chronologies is contained in volumes 29 to 31 , and treatises on subjects such as music , geography , and officials are included in chapters 32 to 40 . The final 10 chapters constitute the section of biographies . According to Kim Pusik 's own writings , the history , which was culled from earlier Chinese official and unofficial histories and included fragmentary Korean accounts , was intended as a \" bequest to the myriad successive generations , a history to gleam like the sun and stars . \" Comparison of Kim 's work with earlier Chinese records indicates that much of the material included under the earlier periods of each of the three kingdoms was worked into the chronology to fill it out . In this sense , it is a very unscholarly piece of historical writing . There was probably much greater coverage of the later periods in the records available to Kim , and this material is more reliable . The work as a whole , however , remains an interesting piece of literature . Kim was also one of the historians charged with compiling the Veritable Records of King Injong ( Injong Sillok ) . Further Reading There are no books on Kim Pusik 's life in Western languages .

On a day when the Dockers also picked up Perth utility player Tendai Mzungu and Adelaide ruckman Jonathon Griffin , Tarrant was returned to his former club for draft picks 43 and 55 . Fremantle also gave up pick 44 to the Magpies as part of the complicated deal . The two clubs spent several days at loggerheads over the deal and Tarrant had warned he would retire unless he could go back to Collingwood . He played nine seasons at the Magpies before joining the Dockers in 2007 as part of the deal that brought Paul Medhurst and Ben Reid to Collingwood . Originally a key forward , Tarrant has reinvented himself as a defender at Fremantle . The 30 - year-old has played a total of 233 games - 161 for Collingwood and 72 for the Dockers . Earlier , the Dockers traded pick 38 in the draft to the Gold Coast Suns , which had registered Mzungu as a pre-listed player . Gold Coast also sent pick 44 in the draft to Fremantle . Mzungu , 24 , has played more than 70 games for WAFL club Perth . In 2010 , he averaged 29 disposal per game and polled 20 votes in the Sandover Medal . He won the Butcher Medal as Perth 's fairest and best player for 2010 . \u201c Tendai played most of his footy across half - back but pushed into the midfield this year and was very impressive , \u201d Fremantle 's general manager of player management Brad Lloyd said . \u201c He is an exceptionally hard worker and is a very smart footballer \u2026 very clean below his knees , uses the ball very well and takes the game on with his run and carry . \u201d Mzungu is the second mature - age player secured by Fremantle in the 2010 trade period , joining Victorian defender Peter Faulks on the club 's list for next season . Fremantle exchanged pick 55 in the draft with the Suns in return for pick 61 and Faulks , who was also pre-listed by the Gold Coast . The Dockers have since traded pick 61 for Adelaide ruckman Griffin after the Crows were able to secure a deal for Carlton 's Sam Jacobs . Griffin , a former East Fremantle player , had requested a trade back to his home state earlier this year . The 24-year-old was drafted by the Crows at pick 21 in the 2005 rookie draft and was elevated to the main list a year later . Griffin played 11 games in 2010 for a total of 41 . Adelaide general manager of football operations Phil Harper said the club was disappointed to lose Griffin , but understood his reasons for wanting to return to Perth . \" You never want to lose someone like Jonathon and we ideally would have liked him to stay , but we recognise that it is best for him to return to his home state , \" he said . \" Jonathon was an important part of our ruck department , and we thank him for his contribution to the football club and wish him all the best at Fremantle . \" A trade for veteran defender Chris Tarrant is still yet to be confirmed . The Dockers and Collingwood - Tarrant 's preferred new home - have until 11 am ( Perth time ) to complete a deal . Meanwhile , Carlton and Adelaide have confirmed a deal that will see Blues ruckman Sam Jacobs return to his home state of South Australia , with the Crows giving up draft picks 33 and 67 . And the Western Bulldogs and Brisbane have confirmed the Justin Sherman deal as the AFL trade week deadline approaches . The Bulldogs will give up the compensation pick they received for losing Jarrod Harbrow to Gold Coast in exchange for Brennan . But Bulldogs forward Josh Hill is unlikely to be traded to Hawthorn , with the two clubs unable to reach agreement as the 11 am ( Perth time ) deadline looms . The paperwork for several other deals has also gone through . with Patrick Veszpremi headed from Sydney to the Bulldogs and Richmond 's Andrew Collins swapping with Carlton 's Shaun Grigg . Geelong traded 21 - year-old defender Jeremy Laidler and pick 41 to Carlton for picks 36 and 53 in the upcoming national draft . Laidler played two games in three years at Skilled Stadium and asked for a trade in search of more opportunities . \u201c We are obviously disappointed to lose Jeremy as we considered him to be a required player , \u201d Geelong general manager of football operations Neil Balme said . \u201c Jeremy considered the Carlton offer of a longer contract and more opportunities to be right for him .

This Article Covers Provisioning and configuration Software developers have embraced the value of virtualization technology and are incorporating hypervisor capabilities into some software products . Nested VMMs , however , place performance - draining demands on system hardware . As hardware developers look for ways to meet these new hardware demands , VMCS shadowing has emerged to extend the capabilities of Intel - VT and provide additional flexibility in the way that system resources are virtualized and shared . Virtualization typically requires the use of one virtual machine monitor -- a hypervisor -- in order to abstract and manage the system 's computing resources . The single VMM approach works well , but continued software development is fostering a new generation of applications that effectively utilize a unique virtual machine monitor ( VMM ) that is not associated with the primary hypervisor 's VMM . This multiple - VMM environment can , however , present serious performance issues for the underlying system . Processor developers , such as Intel , are addressing this emerging problem with the introduction of a new feature called virtual machine control structure ( VMCS ) shadowing . What is VMCS and why do I need VMCS shadowing ? A virtual machine monitor is the core of a hypervisor , responsible for handling the system 's virtualized computing resources . In a typical computing environment , a system hosts a single VMM , which supports each guest virtual machine . When software such as McAfee Deep Defender incorporates a unique VMM , however , it does not share the system equally with the hypervisor 's VMM . Instead , the primary hypervisor forms a root VMM , and the VMM features of other software tools -- guest VMMs -- sit on top of the hypervisor and communicate with the system hardware through the hypervisor . Thus , the guest VMM is nested in the root VMM . Software currently controls nested VMM switching . As you might imagine , forcing a guest VMM to run through the root VMM can introduce latencies that impair the performance of workloads dependent on the guest VMM . As you introduce new software that uses additional VMMs , you need a new means of switching control between VMMs . The VMCS tracks the state of the host and guest VMs as control is handed between them . This feature of Intel - VT helps to accelerate VM switching and improve virtual server performance . Unfortunately , guest VMMs must take the time to access the root VMM and its VMCS . To overcome the performance penalties of nested VMMs , the VMCS is shadowed in hardware , which allows the guest VMM to access a VMCS directly without disrupting the root VMM . VMCS shadow access is almost as fast as a non-nested VMM environment . How is VMCS shadowing implemented on a virtualized server ? Current VMCS features are implemented on the processor as part of the Intel - VT architecture . Multi-VMM support will require the addition of VMCS shadowing , which is also implemented on the processor as part of the CPU 's virtualization capabilities . Intel currently deploys VMCS shadowing in certain fourth - generation Intel Core vPro processors , such as i5 v Pro and i7 v Pro , used in desktop and notebook systems , as well as the Xeon E5- 2600 , E5- 1600 and E3- 1200 processor families for enterprise servers . The technology should eventually appear across a wider range of enterprise processors . For multiple - VMM support , you should only require a system with a processor that has VMCS shadowing enabled in properly developed firmware . If you do not deploy software with its own VMM on the hardware platform , then the VMCS shadowing feature will not enable . Aside from VMCS shadowing , is there another method for VMM nesting ? If the system processors do not support VMCS shadowing , then the system will use software emulation instead . Unfortunately , software emulation forces the guest VMM to operate through the host VMM . In an emulation scenario , the guest VMM will take control of the system from the host VMM in order to perform a read / write task , and the guest VMM will access the VMCS used by the host VMM . When the guest VMM completes the task , it hands control back to the host VMM . An active guest VMM can disrupt the host VMM 's operation and cause significant performance degradation . VMCS shadowing creates a second ( shadow ) VMCS that the guest VMM accesses independently of the host VMM 's VMCS . Thus the guest VM does not disrupt the host VMM , which improves system performance . You must only periodically synchronize the shadow VMCS with the primary VMCS .

On the evening of August 22 , 1961 , a car containing lovers Michael Gregsten and Valerie Storie , was parked by a field near Slough . A man threatened the couple with a gun . After climbing into the car 's back seat , he ordered Gregsten to drive off . They covered about 30 miles before the gunman ordered Gregsten to pull into a lay - by on the A6 at Clophill at around 01:30 am . Deadman 's Hill on the A6 Left for dead The man said he wanted to sleep and that he would have to tie them up . The man tied Storie 's hands behind her back with Gregsten 's tie and then saw a bag in the rear of the car with some rope . He told Gregsten to pass the bag but , as Gregsten moved , there were two shots . Gregsten was hit twice in the head and died instantly . According to Storie 's testimony , when she asked the gunman why he had shot Gregsten he replied that Gregsten had frightened him by turning too quickly . The gunman then raped Valerie Storie before shooting her five times , and leaving her for dead . She was discovered by farm labourer , Sydney Burton , at 06:45 later that morning . He ran down the road and came across John Kerr , a student occupied with taking a road census . Kerr flagged down two cars , shouting at them to get an ambulance . Investigation An identikit picture was constructed from Storie 's description , but as this differed from other descriptions provided by other witnesses , two pictures were issued . Meanwhile , the police discovered two .38 cartridge cases from a hotel room occupied on the night before the murder by Mr J Ryan ( an alias later known to be used by James Hanratty ) . However , the room had also been occupied by Peter Louis Alphon . The police then took the unusual step of publicly naming Alphon as the murder suspect . Alphon subsequently turned himself in , and was subjected to an intensive interrogation . Valerie Storie failed to pick him out of an identity parade , and he was released four days later . Police then turned their efforts into locating Hanratty , a petty car thief and robber , who in fact was facing a six - year jail sentence for robbery . Hanratty is arrested Arrest Hanratty was eventually arrested in Blackpool on 11 October , and on 14 October Valerie Storie picked him out of an Identity Parade , after each of the men in the parade had repeated the phrase used by the murderer , \" Be quiet , will you ? I 'm thinking . \" Hanratty , with his cockney accent , pronounced thinking as ' finking ' , as did the murderer . Hanratty was sent for trial . The trial centred on the issue of identification . Hanratty 's initial defence was that he was in Liverpool on the day of the murder , but then , halfway through the trial , changed part of his story , claiming that he was in fact in Rhyl in North Wales , 200 miles away from the crime scene in Bedfordshire . At that time there was no conclusive forensic evidence to connect Hanratty with the car or the murder scene . Although he was a professional thief , he had no known convictions for violence , and had never owned a gun . Moreover , according to Valerie Storie , the murderer drove badly , whereas Hanratty was an experienced car thief . Hanratty did not know either of the two victims , and did not appear to have any logical motive to commit the murder . Following over nine hours ' deliberation , the jury convicted Hanratty of the capital murder of Gregsten . Hanratty was sentenced to death and was subsequently hanged at Bedford Prison on April 4 , 1962 . However , this was not the end . Discrepancies When family members , journalists and lawyers , began to delve into the case , some discrepancies emerged together with the prospect that an innocent man may have been hanged . To cloud the issue further , Alphon confessed to the murder , although he later withdrew this claim . Hanratty 's family campaigned tirelessly for decades for a posthumous pardon , maintaining that he was nowhere near the scene of the murder . Appeal In March , 1999 , The Criminal Cases Review Commission ( CCRC ) announced that the case was to be referred back to the Court of Criminal Appeal . The court would then decide whether to quash the Hanratty 's conviction , or let the conviction stand . Hanratty 's body was exhumed . On March 22 , 2001 , James Hanratty 's remains , which by then had been moved from Bedford prison to a cemetery near Bushey in Hertfordshire , were exhumed so that a DNA sample could be taken for analysis . The results showed there was a 2.5 million to one chance that the samples came from someone other than Hanratty . In March 2001 , DNA sample extracted from Hanratty 's exhumed body was matched by forensic experts to two samples from the crime scene . Ruling On May 10 , 2002 , the Court of Criminal Appeal ( Lord Chief Justice Woolf , Lord Justice Mantell and Mr Justice Leveson hearing the appeal ) ruled that Hanratty 's conviction was not unsound and that there were no grounds for a posthumous pardon . There was a risk that the DNA could have been placed there by ' contamination ' but crucially no - one else 's DNA , apart form Hanratty , Storie and Gregsten was found . Despite years of campaigning by Hanratty 's family and a host of journalists , film - makers and lawyers , this DNA evidence suggests that the right man went to the gallows \u2026 last updated : 08/04/2009 at 09:53 SEE ALSO You are in : Beds Herts and Bucks > History > Crime & Punishment > James Hanratty - The A6 Murder Abolition About the BBC | Help | Terms of Use | Privacy & Cookies Policy"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

That 's pretty solid advice but calling it \u201c old school \u201d is hardly more than a term of endearment . As Jamie Lewis reminds us in Destroy the Opposition the bench press has been around for less than a century . And squats ( as we know them ) are not that much older . Since barbells appeared sometimes in the middle of the 19th century ( [ 1 ] , p.10 ) , deadlifts are not that old , either . Long before barbells , there were stones and tree trunks , but we do n't need to go that far back . Ancient Rome will do . But why should anyone care about the Romans ? The short answer is \u201c science \u201d . The details will have to wait for a sequel because I 'm already going to break my usual 1.500 - word count just to tell the story , but I promise that it will be worth it . For now , let 's get the Greeks out of the way . How the Greeks almost figured it out Ancient Greeks invented the first sport-specific piece of gym equipment . They called them halteres . [ EDIT : I incorrectly wrote halteroi in a previous version , having mistaken the article ' oi ' for the plural , which speaks volumes for my Ancient Greek skills . Thanks to Antti Ij\u00e4s for spotting the mistake . ] That 's where the French word for dumbbells ( halt\u00e8res ) comes from . They came in a variety of shapes but all had the common characteristic of being weights with handles . Ancient Greeks also seem to have understood progressive overload . The principle is illustrated in the story of Milo of Croton , a 6th century BCE wrestler who was said to have trained himself to carry a bull , beginning with carrying a calf . ( I'd rather assume that you are familiar with progressive overload . If you are not , shame on you . Still , it 's nothing that ca n't be fixed . Visit a library and shuffle through the first chapter of Pr. Zatsiorsky ' Science and Practice of Strength Training . You can also read it online but I 'm unsure about how legal it is . And there 's a Wikipedia page . Finally , if you are in a lazy mood , you can watch Chad Wesley Smith talking about it on YouTube but he 's making it more complicated than it actually is , and the background music is annoying . ) So , why not credit the Greeks ? For two reasons : - dumbbell training was mostly developed by Romans , and : - Milo 's story may not reflect a scientific understanding of progressive overload . As for ( 1 ) , halteres were used in Greece primarily as counterweights for jump training . The most common were of the shape depicted in the right - hand picture and held at arm 's length to gain momentum in the long jump . Now , there is some textual evidence that other models were used for a handful of accessory exercises , like curls , lunges , and some sort of swing ( [ 1 ] , p. 1 ) . Since function usually dictates form , swinging halteres may have looked like modern kettlebells ( where modern means \u201c 16th century and onward \u201d and not \u201c after Pavel Tsatsouline defected to the West \u201d ) . Still , it was not until the 2nd century CE that Roman physician Galen compiled halteres exercises for the whole body . Galen 's interest in physical culture continued a long history of Roman concern for physical fitness as a civic virtue ( I'll come back to that ) . Moreover , Galen 's treatises on hygiene \u2014 in particular , De Sanitate Tuenda ( \u201c On the preservation of health \u201d ) \u2014 were still being used as strength training textbooks well into the 19th century , when barbells gradually supplanted dumbbells , and new exercises were developed . As for ( 2 ) , the origin of the notion that the Greeks understood progressive overload is that stories agree that it took about 4 years to Milo to develop the strength to carry a bull . But we know that the calf - to - bull story is most likely a fabrication aimed at comparing Milo with Hercules whose author never knew Milo . The time frame was probably dictated by the internal logic of the tale , something like : \u201c Milo could carry a bull just like Hercules , but he was not a demigod . It must have taken a few years to develop the strength . How long does it take for a calf to grow into a bull already ? \u201d So , exit the Greeks . Let 's jump to 107 BCE , one of the most important years in the history Rome and ( for much of the same reason ) in the history of fitness . ' The Year of the Consulship of Ravilla and Marius ' In 107 BCE , Rome is the only superpower left in the Mediterranean . Forty - odd years earlier ( 146 BCE ) Rome has dealt once and for all with its archenemy Carthage , putting an end to centuries of political , economic and military rivalry . The same year , Roman legions sacked Corinth and added the Peloponnese to the Roman province of Macedonia , putting an end to centuries of inferiority complex towards the Greeks . And yet , Roman legions are embroiled in a low-intensity conflict against rebel forces led by Jugurtha in Numidia ( still nominally an ally of Rome ) and are playing hide - and - seek with German invaders in Transalpine Gaul ( a Roman province ) . The body count is nowhere near what it used to be during the Carthaginian wars , but the operations have been dragging for years , fueling sourpuss conversations in the motherland . Gaius Marius , one of the two consuls elected for this year , has promised to put a swift end to the Numidian war . A military genius who has served under Metellus , commander of the legions in Numidia , Marius has run on a simple electoral platform : crush the enemy , see them driven before him , and hear the lamentation of their women get the boys back home . On the campaign trail , Marius implied ( with good reason ) that high - ranking Roman officers were not above taking bribes not to attack the enemy . This , he said , would explain the protracted war in Numidia . Marius is not a conspiracy - theory - loving populist and his half - veiled accusations hide a deeper concern ( I'll come to that soon ) . But the Senate did not like them and has retaliated in its usual passive - aggressive manner , nitpicking on the legal details to avoid transferring the imperium over the Numidian legions from Metellus to Marius . While Marius and his allies are trying to get around the Senate , word comes of a possible barbarian invasion of Cisalpine Gaul . The fear of a barbarian invasion is just what Marius needed . Roman fitness is about to change forever . Fitness , a forgotten civic duty Until 107 BCE , Roman levies depended on the wealth - based census , essentially because Roman soldiers had to purchase their own equipment . There was no formal military training , boot camp , or the like . Getting in fighting shape and learning the basics of martial arts was a civic duty . Mastery would come with field experience . And for those citizens who could afford their equipment and were eligible for military duty , field experience had never been in short supply . Since its foundation , Rome had conducted almost non-stop military business against enemy foreign and domestic , on its own or on behalf of allies . Consequently , citizens from census classes eligible for levies had been almost guaranteed to be part of a legion once in their life . Furthermore , an impeccable military record had become a condition to run for the lucrative offices of the Republic , and a reputation of heroism was always welcome \u2014 something that Marius knew well . Thus , generation after generation of wealthy Romans had had powerful incentives to get and stay in fighting shape : survive wars first in order to line their pocket with tax money later serve the Republic in both war and peace . But the victory against Carthage has changed it all . General officers could now capitalize on Rome 's reputation without going into battle too often ( \u201c How much would you pay me not to level your city like Scipio did to Carthago ? \u201d ) . The rank- and - file of the legions was beginning to lack of field experience . And citizens eligible for duty do not see the point of spending as much time and money for martial training as they once had . Soon , Romans citizens will be too out - of - shape to be of real military value . Marius ' mules Fear of a barbarian invasion in Italy gave Marius the opportunity he needed to recruit the first ever professional army in the history of Rome . Census classes eligible for military duty had been depleted by the Numidian and Gallic operations . With no wealthy Romans to send against Barbarians , Marius convinced the Senate to lift the census requirement and let him recruit professional soldiers . This required a huge investment in equipment and food , but Marius placated the cheeseparing Senate by agreeing that soldiers would repay their equipment and food with their wages . Marius then set to enlist the capite censi ( literally : the \u201c head count \u201d ) whose numbers had swelled in the last hundred years or so , following an unprecedented job crisis created by an influx of cheap slaves . These Romans were nominally citizens but did not own property worth registering in the census , and were \u201c counted by the head \u201d rather than ranked by the wealth . They were not allowed to vote , let alone run for office , and had no prospect whatsoever of upward social mobility . Given the right incentive , they would rush to enroll . And thus Marius ' supporters in the Senate passed a law guaranteeing that after completing a 16 - year engagement , veterans would receive a pension and a plot of land in the province they had helped pacifying . In other words , surviving veterans were guaranteed to make it into the census ( with all its collaterals ) . This gave the disenfranchised masses the same incentives to serve the Republic as wealthier Romans . But the capite censi was underfed , lived in unsanitary conditions , and was overall badly out of shape . All of which Marius had anticipated . Marius had designed a military fitness curriculum to whip the lowly plebs recruits into fighting shape . He had based it on his vision of a new army ( mobile , self - reliant and tireless ) , and had even poached from the private sector the toughest drill instructors he could find ( gladiatorial school trainers ) . By the end of Marius ' basic training , Roman legionaries could wake up at dawn , break camp in an orderly fashion , walk all day at an average of 5.3 km / hr [ 2 ] while carrying 25 kilograms ( 55 lbs ) of equipment ( including food rations ) , set a fortified camp with protective ditch and earth-and - timber wall , cook and eat porridge for dinner , sleep , wake up at dawn and go kick barbarian ass . Day-in , day out . As fresh as if they had just returned from R&R in Campania . Wealthy Romans were all too happy to leave the increasingly tiresome military business to the penniless masses . They would later mock the new breed of professional soldiers , calling them muli mariani , \u201c Marius ' mules \u201d ( Note to Latin buffs : mulus also means \u201c stupid \u201d . The translation \u201c Marius ' ass \u201d would thus convey the same kind of connotation as mulus marianus . ) To be continued The Cisalpine invasion never came and Marius concluded the Numidian affair without raising new legions . He outmaneuvered the Senate , took command of the legions already in Numidia , and he terminated the war using back - channel negotiations of the very kind he had campaigned against . But the law was in place . Three years later , after one of the worst military disaster in Roman history , the Senate would call upon Marius again to end the terror cimbricus ( \u201c Cimbric terror \u201d ) in Transalpine Gaul . Marius ' professionally - trained soldiers would prevail against the enemy , and survive battle after battle . Less than a century later , so many veterans had retired in good a shape that there was not enough land to grant them in the provinces . The Republic was forced to transfer executive powers to generals such as Gaius Julius Caesar , Mark Antony , and Octavian , who would undertake expansion wars ( in all but name ) in order to solve the \u201c veteran crisis \u201d . One could well say that Marius ' training regimen was a contributing factor to the end of the Republic and the beginning of the Empire . This should be no surprise : the training regimen of the Roman legion was pretty much what the latest science would recommend for forging elite fitness . This will be the topic of a follow - up , someday . But I can already tell you that it did not look like Cross*it .

Pinochet was the Commander in Chief of the Chilean Army until 1974 when he assumed the title of President of the Republic . His presidency lasted until 1990 and his role as Commander in Chief until 1998 . His regime was known for its systematic and widespread violations of human rights , with allegations of murder , torture and hostage taking of political opponents . In 1998 , during a visit to the United Kingdom for medical treatment , Pinochet was arrested by the English authorities with a view to extraditing him to Spain where a Spanish judge had issued an international arrest warrant . His extradition was , however , not to proceed smoothly as Pinochet applied to have the arrest warrant quashed on the grounds that as a former Head of State he enjoyed immunity from criminal proceedings . By a decision of 25 November 1998 , the House of Lords in a 3:2 majority held that Pinochet was not entitled to immunity from criminal proceedings and could therefore be extradited . back to top Procedural history On 16 October 1998 , a Spanish judge issued an international arrest warrant for the Respondent , Augusto Pinochet Ugarte . In order to respond to the need to execute the international arrest warrant as the Respondent was at the time in England on a medical visit and due to depart to Chile the following day , a Metropolitan Magistrate issued a provisional arrest warrant on the grounds that between 1973 and 1983 he murdered Spanish citizens in Chile . This arrest warrant was deficient as the offence on which it was based was not an extraditable offence . Consequently , on 18 October 1998 , the Spanish judge issued a second international arrest warrant for the Respondent ( see here in Spanish only ) . That same day , a second provisional arrest warrant was issued by another Metropolitan Magistrate on the grounds that between 1988 and 1992 the Respondent committed , inter alia , acts of torture and hostage taking . On 23 October 1998 , the Respondent was arrested in England . On 22 and 26 October , the Respondent applied to quash the first and second provisional arrest warrants respectively . On 28 October 1998 , the High Court granted the Respondent leave to apply for a writ of certiorari . At the same time , the first arrest warrant was quashed . The quashing of the second arrest warrant was stayed pending an appeal to the House of Lords , the highest court in England . Hearings before the House of Lords were heard on 4 , 5 and 9 to 12 November 1998 . back to top Related developments Pinochet petitioned the House of Lords to set aside its decision of 25 November 1998 on the grounds of an appearance of bias between one of the members of the Appellate Committee , Lord Hoffmann , and Amnesty International , the human rights organisation who was admitted as intervener in the appeal . By a decision of 17 December 1998 , the decision of 25 November 1998 was set aside ( see also ' The Law Lords and the General ' , The Economist , 17 December 1998 ) . Pinochet was therefore entitled to a new hearing on his original immunity claim . By a decision of 24 March 1999 , the House of Lords held that Pinochet does not enjoy immunity in respect of acts of torture committed after the entry into force of the 1984 Torture Convention for the UK , that is after 8 December 1988 . In response to questions about the Respondent 's allegedly fragile state of health , the Home Secretary ruled in January 2000 that the Respondent should not be extradited . Accordingly , by a decision of 2 March 2000 , the Home Secretary ordered the release of the Respondent who returned to Chile ( see ' Pinochet Set Free ' , BBC News , 2 March 2000 ) . On 8 August 2000 , the Supreme Court of Chile voted to strip Pinochet of the immunity he enjoyed by virtue of his parliamentary position . On 1 December 2000 , Pinochet was indicted for the kidnapping of 75 political opponents ( see ' Pinochet Charged with Kidnapping ' , BBC News , 1 December 2000 On 11 December 2000 , the Court of Appeal of Santiago halted the proceedings for medical reasons . On 30 January 2001 , the judge reissued the arrest warrant for Pinochet but proceedings were again halted for medical reasons . In July 2002 , the Supreme Court of Chile dismissed Pinochet 's indictment in the various cases against him for medical reasons ( see ' Pinochet Arrest Ordered ' , BBC News , 30 January 2001 ) . Shortly after the decision , Pinochet resigned from the Senate but continued to enjoy immunity from prosecution by virtue of a constitutional amendment that was brought about in 2000 . On 8 September 2006 , the Supreme Court of Chile stripped Pinochet of his immunity ( see ' Court Lifts Pinochet Immunity ' , BBC News , 8 September 2006 ) . On 30 October 2006 , Pinochet was charged with 36 counts of kidnapping , 23 counts of torture , and one of murder for the torture and disappearance of opponents of his regime at Villa Grimaldi ( see Human Rights Watch , ' Chile : Pinochet Finally Faces Torture Charges ' ) . On 28 November 2006 , Pinochet was placed under house arrest ; he died twelve days later , on 10 December 2006 . back to top Legally relevant facts On 11 September 1973 , General Augusto Pinochet Ugarte assumed power in Chile after a military coup . He was appointed president of the governing military junta on the same day . On 22 September 1973 , the new regime was recognised by the British government . By a decree of 11 December 1974 , General Pinochet assumed the title of President of the Republic . Following democratic elections in December 1989 , General Pinochet handed over power to President Aylwin on 11 March 1990 ( p. 24 ) . back to top Core legal questions back to top - Is the Respondent entitled to immunity either by virtue of State immunity or Head of State immunity ? Specific legal rules and provisions back to top - Articles 4 and 6 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide . - Articles 28 , 29 and 31 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations . - International Convention against the Taking of Hostages . - Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment . - Section 134 ( 1 ) of the 1988 UK Criminal Justice Act. - Sections 2 ( 1 ) ( b ) and 8 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the 1989 UK Extradition Act. - Sections 1 , 14 , 16 ( 4 ) , 20 ( 1 ) and ( 5 ) of the UK State Immunity Act. - UK Diplomatic Privileges Act. - Uk Taking Hostages Act. Court 's holding and analysis It is necessary to distinguish between three different principles . First , State immunity , as codified in Part I of 1978 State Immunity Act. Second , personal immunity of Heads of State , codified in Part II of the same Act . Third , the act of State doctrine , which remains a common law matter ( p. 43 ) . Although State immunity under Part I extends to Heads of State , it does not apply in respect of criminal proceedings ( p. 44 ) . The act of State doctrine is inapplicable in the present instance as Parliament has shown that the conduct with which the Respondent is charged is a justiciable matter before the English courts by enacting section 134 ( 1 ) of the 1988 Criminal Justice Act defining torture and section 1 ( 1 ) of the 1982 Taking Hostages Act ( p. 45 ) . With respect to personal immunity , section 20 of the 1978 State Immunity Act confers immunity from criminal proceedings upon Heads of State . Following an interpretation of Article 39 ( 2 ) of 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations , incorporated by reference , this immunity extends to former Heads of State in respect of official acts ( p. 46 ) . Official acts are those recognised by international law as functions of a Head of State , irrespective of the terms of individual 's domestic constitution . Accordingly , acts of torture and hostage taking are not functions of a Head of State and therefore no immunity can attach to them in respect of criminal proceedings ( p. 47 ) . By a majority of 3:2 ( Lords Hoffman , Nicholls and Steyn ) , their Lordships allowed the appeal and held that the Respondent was not entitled to immunity ( pp. 49 , 56 ) . back to top Further analysis back to top - N.

On the east the Barlik ranges rose to an altitude of 9,500 ft. , and , far away in the dim distance , the loftier snows of the Ala-tau lifted themselves into the blue ; but , separating us from them , was a break in the mountain - wall , -a deep - cut depression dividing the Siberian plains from the Dzungarian deserts , and lying between the ramparts of the Ala-tau on the west and those of the Barlik on the east . We had frequently heard of the terrors , dangers , and winds of the Dzungarian Gate . We had read the records of such early travellers as Carpini and Rubruck , both of whom mentioned that \u201c there blows nearly continuously such a wind through this valley , that persons cross it with great danger , lest the wind should carry them into the sea . \u201d We therefore approached this remarkable geological phenomenon both with interest and a certain amount of anxiety , for the weather was unusually unsettled , snow - clouds were threatening us , and we were unwilling our caravan should be \u201c blown away into the sea . \" Even at a distance , with the Dzungarian Gate lying before us \u2014 unseen , we instinctively became aware of its presence ; for when we came within sight of Ala Kul , whilst crossing the open foot -hills of the Barlik Range 1 The Barlik proper overlooks the Dzungarian Gate on the east . We found the natives using Barlik for the whole mountain - group to the oast . I use the term , therefore , to include the Chagan-oba , the Dzusau , and the Maili ranges . some twenty miles from the lake - shore and some 2,000 ft . above it , we were in absolute stillness ; and yet , strangely enough , the waters of Ala Kul were tossed into waves the white crests being clearly seen with a glass , while even with the naked eye breakers could be distinguished dashing on to the southern shore of an island in the middle of the lake . Although we were becalmed , there was evidently a gale blowing through the \u201c Gate , \" and as we approached nearer we became at every step more keenly alive to the action of this wind - trough . At night we heard a distant roar as the imprisoned winds of the Dzungarian deserts escaped through this narrow defile . The only night we camped on the very shore of the straits , the wind increased to such a violence that our tents , though well protected in a valley , were by the morning all blown away , for the wind swept in great gusts over the hills , and the back eddies tore them down ; the noise was terrific , and sleep out of the question . This wind came from the south , but threatening storm - clouds to the north made us far more uneasy . Fortunately we succeeded in crossing the depression in a nine hours ' trek without mishap , a strong head - wind being the only cause for annoyance . Had there been rain or snow falling , travelling would have been impossible , but the wind was luckily from the south and comparatively warm , the temperature at night only just touching freezing - point . Only just in time did we escape from this home of the winds , for the day after crossing the valley , \u2014 when travelling southwards along its western flanks , \u2014 the wind swung round to the north and swept cruelly through the gap , bringing with it hail and frozen snow . Had we then been journeying north wards the making of any headway would have been out of the question , for neither man nor beast could have faced the elements ; travelling as we were \u2014 with the wind \u2014 we endured the cold and congratulated ourselves on our fortunate escape . A bleak , inhospitable landscape now surrounded us , mountains , clad in fresh snow , showed up here and there through breaks in the blurred atmosphere , and great cloud - banks swept through the straits , \" as if rushing through some gigantic funnel . We enjoyed no rest until we were safely ensconced in the broken and wind - worn granite range lying to the north - west of Ebi Nor . The natives relate the usual traditions as to the origin of the winds in this locality . In the myths of Central Asia a \u201c hole in the mountain , \u201d or \u201c an iron gate in a lake \" is the usual explanation of the origin of winds . In the case of which I am writing the island called Ala-tyube \u2014 a small extinct volcano in Ala Kul - is made responsible for the furious winds which sweep through the depression ; the wind is called \u201c ebe , \u201d or yube \u201d by the Kirghiz , and in special cases , when it reaches its maximum velocity , the term \u201c buran \u201d is applied . From autumn to spring the prevailing wind is from the south - east . ' I think , however , that the \" I found considerable difficulty in getting reliable information as to the prevailing winds of this district . A Russian who had lived at a frontier post in the Dzungarian Gate said that the strongest burans always came from the south - east , while the rain - winds came from the north - west . He said that \u201c the air was always moving , \" but that autumn and spring were especially marked as the windy seasons . Chinese soldiers in the guard - houses on the high - road which passes the south end of Ebi Nor where there is a belt of sand dunes , claimed that , when the sand moved , it always came from the north - west , or the direction of the Dzungarian Gate . Their statement was proved by the fact that their guard - houses in the sand - belt were banked up by high sand dunes on the north- west . The burans , they said , also came from the direction of the Gate . In contra wind which causes havoc amongst the nomads , and kills off men and flocks when caught unprotected , is this . north wind when it attains the velocity of what is called a \u201c buran . \" We experienced one buran only during our journey across Asia , and it took place in this very locality during the following summer . On June 20th a buran struck us from the north when camped on the south side of the main ridge of the Dzusau portion of the Barlik group , which stood up like a wall close above our camp , , and gave us protection from that quarter . In Central Asia the highest gale is inconsiderable in comparison with a buran . A vast difference lies between the two : a buran blows steadily , without lulls , and with a force against which it is useless to contend . Miller describes how this buran caught him , when on a hunting expedition :- \" On the second day away an everincreasing wind began to blow from the north - west , though the sky was cloudless . By the evening it had blown up into such a gale that we had the greatest difficulty in reaching the yurts for which we were making . It was all our horses could do to move against the force of the wind , which frequently shifted us in our saddles . By night - time the yurt in which we had taken shelter began to suffer . The huge pieces of felt which covered the roof worked loose , and were whisked away , causing the frame - work to rattle down upon us . It was only the diction of this , I noticed that all the sand - dunes at the south end of Ebi Nor were formed by winds which must have blown from the eastnorth -east . Ebi Nor , by its very name , is \u201c wind - lake , \u201d and it would be hard to give an impression of the sight its frozen waters presented in midwinter . We saw it in January , from the crest of a sand - dune on its southern edge . Its southern shores were a jumble of great blocks . of ice piled up in fantastic shapes , and the actual surface of the ice was as if its waves had been instantaneously frozen solid in stormy weather ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Copyright \u00a9 Practical Fishkeeping Some fishkeepers , and possibly even a few traders , may be puzzled as to why so much fuss has been made about dyed fish . On the face of it , the practice of dyeing or \" painting \" the fish seems fairly innocuous and the artificially dyed specimens are certainly very eye-catching in their various \" day-glo \" colours . So why push for a voluntary ban on selling them ? Our investigations have revealed the truth behind the dyed fish saga . Disco fish Our first encounter with dyed fish was back in the late 1980's . Thousands of artificially coloured glassfish , Parambassis ranga ( formerly Chanda ranga ) were imported into the UK . The glassfish , so named because of its naturally semi-transparent body , obviously makes it an ideal subject for \" painting \" . They were seen with fluorescent shades of either blue , purple , red , yellow , orange or green produced by dyes . They were ( and still are ) imported under the names \" painted glassfish \" or \" disco fish \" ( presumably because their almost fluorescent colours resemble discotheque lights ) . How is the dye applied ? Intrigued as to how the dye was applied we decided to carry out a little research . A few coloured glassfish were sedated in MS222 anaesthetic and observed under a binocular microscope . It became apparent that the dye is not on the surface of the fish , but lay under the epidermis . Furthermore , the dye appeared fluid and could be moved slightly by gently squeezing the coloured area . This suggested that it must have been injected into the fish at various sites over the body in order to form the distinctive colour patterns . Our fears were confirmed a few years later when we were shown photographs of the colouring process , revealing that each fish is individually injected using a syringe and needle . The practice of dye injection is undertaken by fish farmers in some regions of Asia ( but not Singapore as far as we know ) . Clearly , the common name \" painted glassfish \" is a cruelly misleading description . If one considers the relative bore size of the injection needle with that of a glassfish , it would be the equivalent of us receiving several jabs using a needle of pencil-sized diameter - not a pleasant thought . As experienced fish scientists , we would never dream of injecting fish of such small size . No wonder the injection process is alleged to cause high mortalities . Increasing the risk of disease ... A survey which we carried out in the south of England revealed that over 40 % of painted glassfish appeared to be suffering from lymphocystis virus . This disease manifests itself as a small whitish growths on the fish 's body and fins . An examination of the white growths under the powerful electron microscope confirmed our diagnosis . In contrast , less than 10 % of the natural ( unpainted ) glassfish had lymphocystis . It is possible that the injection process increases the risk of this disease , perhaps by transmitting the virus from fish to fish via the needle ( the same needle is used to inject tens or even hundreds of fish ) . Alternatively , the stress of being injected with the dye may lower the fish 's natural immunity to lymphocystis . It must be said that , in our experience , those glassfish which survive the injection process go on to live fairly normal lives , despite the gaudy dyes present within their bodies . In time , the dye fades . Moral issue Many people believe that fish do not feel pain and so injecting them with dyes is perfectly acceptable . In fact , increasing scientific evidence suggests that fish are indeed capable of feeling pain , though we have no way of telling whether they perceive painful events in the same way as we do . So dye injection is likely to be a painful experience for the poor glassfish . In fairness , many traders and hobbyists were mislead , just as we first were , into thinking that these fish were simply painted with the dye . Now that the truth is out , it 's time to stop this cruel practice , once and for all . Other species which are sometimes dyed Glassfish are not the only species which are subjected to artificial colouring . Many types of albino fish also make ideal \" white canvasses \" for colouring . We have observed the following artificially coloured fish in the UK , and suspect there may be others . Albino versions of Corydoras catfish , such as aeneus ; Tiger barbs ; Albino Epalzeorhynchus ( formerly Labeo ) such as the Red-finned shark ; Black widow tetras ; Rams and some Botia species . Typically these exhibit red or blue on part of the body , but the dyes are not as bright or gaudy as those used to inject glassfish . Fish which have pale or semi-transparent bodies such as the glassfish , Kryptoterus , also suffer . Other fish on offer One supplier in Thailand currently offers a very wide range of dyed fish on its online stock list which are clearly marked as being injected . Their stocklist is shown below . Color Silver Shark Color Albino Rainbow Shark Color Albino Irridescent Shark Mixcolor Ompok Red Ompok Blue Ompok Green Ompok Yellow Ompok Orange Ompok Purple Ompok Pink Ompok Tinfoil Blushing - blue Tinfoil Blushing - red Tinfoil Blushing -green Tinfoil Blushing - pink Tinfoil Blushing - purple Tinfoil Assorted Color Color Tiger Barb Color Redtail Botia Blue Redtail Botia Red Redtail Botia Green Redtail Botia Yellow Redtail Botia Orange Redtail Botia Purple Redtail Botia Pink Redtail Botia Two Color Glass Fish Red Glass Fish Blue Glass Fish Green Glass Fish Yellow Glass Fish Orange Glass Fish Purple Glass Fish Pink Glass Fish Black Color Glass Fish Color Tetra Red Tetra Blue Tetra Green Tetra Yellow Tetra Orange Tetra Purple Tetra Pink Tetra Black Tetra White Tetra Others ...

The majority of British retailers signed up and dyed fish are now relatively uncommon in the UK .

Compare Aesch . Seven 1005 ff . A different version of the story is told by Hyginus , Fab. 72 . According to him , when Antigone was caught in the act of performing funeral rites for her brother Polynices , Creon handed her over for execution to his son Haemon , to whom she had been betrothed . But Haemon , while he pretended to put her to death , smuggled her out of the way , married her , and had a son by her . In time the son grew up and came to Thebes , where Creon detected him by the bodily mark which all descendants of the Sparti or Dragon - men bore on their bodies . In vain Herakles interceded for Haemon with his angry father . Creon was inexorable ; so Haemon killed himself and his wife Antigone . Some have thought that in this narrative Hyginus followed Euripides , who wrote a tragedy Antigone , of which a few fragments survive . See TGF ( Nauck 2nd ed. ) , pp. 404ff . 2 As to the flight of Adrastus to Athens , and the intervention of the Athenians on his behalf see Isoc. 4.54 - 58 ; Isoc. 12.168-174 ; Paus. 1.39.2 ; Plut. Thes. 29 ; Statius , Theb. xii.464ff. , \uff08 who substitutes Argive matrons as suppliants instead of Adrastus\uff09 . The story is treated by Euripides in his extant play The Suppliants , which , on the whole , Apollodorus follows . But whereas Apollodorus , like Statius , lays the scene of the supplication at the altar of Mercy in Athens , Euripides lays it at the altar of Demeter in Eleusis \uff08 Eur. Supp. 1 ff.\uff09. In favour of the latter version it may be said that the graves of the fallen leaders were shown at Eleusis , near the Flowery Well \uff08 Paus. 1.39.1 ff . ; Plut . Thes. 29 \uff09 ; while the graves of the common soldiers were at Eleutherae , which is on the borders of Attica and Boeotia , on the direct road from Eleusis to Thebes \uff08 Eur. Supp. 756 ff . ; Plut . Thes. 29 \uff09 . Tradition varied also on the question how the Athenians obtained the permission of the Thebans to bury the Argive dead . Some said that Theseus led an army to Thebes , defeated the Thebans , and compelled them to give up the dead Argives for burial . This was the version adopted by Euripides , Statius , and Apollodorus . Others said that Theseus sent an embassy and by negotiations obtained the voluntary consent of the Thebans to his carrying off the dead . This version , as the less discreditable to the Thebans , was very naturally adopted by them \uff08 Paus. 1.39.2 \uff09 and by the patriotic Boeotian Plutarch , who expressly rejects Euripides 's account of the Theban defeat . Isocrates , with almost incredible fatuity , adopts both versions in different passages of his writings and defends himself for so doing \uff08 Isoc. 12.168 -174 \uff09 . Lysias , without expressly mentioning the flight of Adrastus to Athens , says that the Athenians first sent heralds to the Thebans with a request for leave to bury the Argive dead , and that when the request was refused , they marched against the Thebans , defeated them in battle , and carrying off the Argive dead buried them at Eleusis . See Lys. 2.7-10 . 3 As to the altar of Mercy at Athens see above Apollod . 2.8.1 ; Paus. 1.17.1 , with my note \uff08vol . ii. pp. 143ff.\uff09 ; Diod. 13.22.7 ; Statius , Theb. xii.481-505 . It is mentioned in a late Greek inscription found at Athens \uff08 Corpus Inscriptionum Atticarum , iii .170 ; G. Kaibel , Epigrammata Graeca ex lapidibus conlecta 792 \uff09 . The altar , though not mentioned by early writers , was in later times one of the most famous spots in Athens . Philostratus says that the Athenians built an altar of Mercy as the thirteenth of the gods , and that they poured libations on it , not of wine , but of tears \uff08 Philostratus , Epist. 39 \uff09 . In this fancy he perhaps copied Statius , Theb. xii.488 , \u201c lacrymis altaria sudant \u201d . 4 The branch of olive which a suppliant laid on the altar of a god in token that he sought the divine protection . See Andoc. 1.110 ff . ; Jebb on Sophocles , OT 3 . 5 For the death of Evadne on the pyre of her husband Capaneus , see Eur. Supp. 1034 ff . ; Zenobius , Cent. i.30 ; Prop. i.15.21 ff . ; Ovid , Tristia v.14.38 ; Ovid , Pont. iii.1.111 ff . ; Hyginus , Fab. 243 ; Statius , Theb. xii.800ff. , with the note of Lactantius Placidus on Statius , Theb. v. 801 ; Martial iv . 75.5 . Capaneus had been killed by a thunderbolt as he was mounting a ladder at the siege of Thebes . See Apollod . 3.6.7 . Hence his body was deemed sacred and should have been buried , not burned , and the grave fenced off ; whereas the other bodies were all consumed on a single pyre . See Eur. Supp. 934-938 , where \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03ae\u03be\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf \u03bd refers to the fencing in of the grave . So the tomb of Semele , who was also killed by lightning , seems to have stood within a sacred enclosure . See Eur. Ba. 6 - 11 . Yet , inconsistently with the foregoing passage , Euripides appears afterwards to assume that the body of Capaneus was burnt on a pyre \uff08 Eur. Supp. 1000 ff .\uff09. The rule that a person killed by a thunderbolt should be buried , not burnt , is stated by Pliny , Nat. Hist. ii.145 and alluded to by Tertullian , Apologeticus 48 . An ancient Roman law , attributed to Numa , forbade the celebration of the usual obsequies for a man who had been killed by lightning . See Festus , s.v. \u201c Occisum , \u201d p. 178 , ed. C. O. M\u00fcller . It is true that these passages refer to the Roman usage , but the words of Eur. Supp. 934-938 seem to imply that the Greek practice was similar , and this is confirmed by Artemidorus , who says that the bodies of persons killed by lightning were not removed but buried on the spot \uff08 Artemidorus , Onirocrit. ii.9 \uff09. The same writer tells us that a man struck by lightning was not deemed to be disgraced , nay , he was honoured as a god ; even slaves killed by lightning were approached with respect , as honoured by Zeus , and their dead bodies were wrapt in fine garments . Such customs are to some extent explained by the belief that Zeus himself descended in the flash of lightning ; hence whatever the lightning struck was naturally regarded as holy . Places struck by lightning were sacred to Zeus the Descender \uff08 \u0396\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \uff09 and were enclosed by a fence . Inscriptions marking such spots have been found in various parts of Greece . See Pollux ix.41 ; Paus. 5.14.10 , with \uff08 Frazer , Paus. vol. iii. p. 565 , vol. v. p. 614 \uff09 . Compare E. Rohde , Psyche ( 3 ) , i.320 ff . ; H. Useher , \u201c Keraunos , \u201d Kleine Schriften , iv.477 ff . , \uff08 who quotes from Clemens Romanus and Cyrillus more evidence of the worship of persons killed by lightning \uff09 ; Chr. Blinkenberg , The Thunder-weapon in Religion and Folklore \uff08 Cambridge , 1911 \uff09 , pp. 110 ff . Among the Ossetes of the Caucasus a man who has been killed by lightning is deemed very lucky , for they believe that he has been taken by St. Elias to himself . So the survivors raise cries of joy and sing and dance about him . His relations think it their duty to join in these dances and rejoicings , for any appearance of sorrow would be regarded as a sin against St. Elias and therefore punishable . The festival lasts eight days . The deceased is dressed in new clothes and laid on a pillow in the exact attitude in which he was struck and in the same place where he died . At the end of the celebrations he is buried with much festivity and feasting , a high cairn is erected on his grave , and beside it they set up a tall pole with the skin of a black he-goat attached to it , and another pole , on which hang the best clothes of the deceased . The grave becomes a place of pilgrimage . See Julius von Klaproth , Reise in den Kaukasus und nach Georgien \uff08 Halle and Berlin , 1814 \uff09 , ii .606 ; A. von Haxthausen , Transkaukasia \uff08 Leipsig , 1856 \uff09 , ii.21 ff . Similarly the Kafirs of South Africa \u201c have strange notions respecting the lightning . They consider that it is governed by the umshologu , or ghost , of the greatest and most renowned of their departed chiefs , and who is emphatically styled the inkosi ; but they are not at all clear as to which of their ancestors is intended by this designation . Hence they allow of no lamentation being made for a person killed by lightning , as they say that it would be a sign of disloyalty to lament for one whom the inkosi had sent for , and whose services he consequently needed ; and it would cause him to punish them , by making the lightning again to descend and do them another injury . \u201d Further , rites of purification have to be performed by a priest at the kraal where the accident took place ; and till these have been performed , none of the inhabitants may leave the kraal or have intercourse with other people . Meantime their heads are shaved and they must abstain from drinking milk . The rites include a sacrifice and the inoculation of the people with powdered charcoal . See \u201c Mr. Warner 's Notes , \u201d in Col. Maclean 's Compendium of Kafir Laws and Customs \uff08 Cape Town , 1866 \uff09 , pp. 82 - 84 . Sometimes , however , the ghosts of persons who have been killed by lightning are deemed to be dangerous . Hence the Omahas used to slit the soles of the feet of such corpses to prevent their ghosts from walking about . See J. Owen Dorsey , \u201c A Study of Siouan Cults , \u201d Eleventh Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology \uff08 Washington , 1894 \uff09 , p. 420 . For more evidence of special treatment accorded to the bodies of persons struck dead by lightning , see A. B. Ellis , The Ewe-speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast \uff08 London , 1890 \uff09 , p. 39 ff . ; A. B. Ellis , The Yoruba-speaking Peoples of the Slave Coast \uff08 London , 1894 \uff09 , p. 49 ; Rev.

Kitching , On the backwaters of the Nile \uff08 London , 1912 \uff09 , pp. 264 ff . Among the Barundi of Central Africa , a man or woman who has been struck , but not killed , by lightning becomes thereby a priest or priestess of the god Kiranga , whose name he or she henceforth bears and of whom he or she is deemed a bodily representative . And any place that has been struck by lightning is enclosed , and the trunk of a banana- tree or a young fig-tree is set up in it to serve as the temporary abode of the deity who manifested himself in the lightning .

He was lucky to have all the major competition surgically removed by a combination of the stewards and a fast-starting Villeneuve , but pulled away steadily until his stop on lap 34 . The race changed complexion for everyone as rain started to fall , but Schumacher reacted quickest and pitted for rain tyres - to the cost of his team mate , who pitted the same lap to find no tyres out for him . An incident on lap 47 , where he understeered off the racetrack and skated over the grass - only to recover unabated - was the only real drama , the result of a slight brake niggle . \" Because of the problems at the back we had guessed what to do about it and put the brake balance completely to the front and I locked up going into turn one , \" explained Schumacher . \" The car went sliding straight into the gravel trap so I decided it was such an easy gravel area I would carry on going through it rather that spin the car . But it was n't really a worry . \" The Ferrari star led away from the start , to be followed by David Coulthard . The Scot was left solely to challenge Schumacher in the early stages of the race , but a storm was already brewing - in more ways than one . An incident before the race even started was to prove Coulthard 's downfall . Unbeknown to the championship second - place man , the stewards were preparing to bring him in for a ten second stop- and - go - penalty . Coulthard had discovered , to his anguish , that his clutch had developed a fault as the cars sat on the grid before the parade lap . He signalled to his crew , and as the thirty - second signal sounded , the crew were attempting to rectify the fault . The problem was solved just as the signal sounded , but Coulthard had already become a victim of the rule book . Any competitor who experiences trouble as the fifteen second signal sounds must raise his arm and wait until the cars have left the grid before receiving assistance , according the regulations . This was unequivocally breached by the team , and so Coulthard would be set to drop from hero - second - to zero - ninth - in the space of a lap . \" I do not want to criticise anyone because the rules are the rules but the FIA should allow the stewards to show some common sense if someone does not gain an advantage , \" said Coulthard . \" This is what turns people off the sport . They were deprived of a race . \" The Scot was deprived of more than just a race , as six points went begging . His complaints came to no avail , and he later admitted that he had , in fact , stalled the car . The race changed complexion for everyone as rain started to fall , which it threatened to do on lap 22 , and then did in earnest 22 laps later . Further back , Jacques Villeneuve got a blinder of a getaway and leapt into fourth by the first turn . As Barrichello and Hakkinen argued over third into the first hairpin , the Canadian grabbed his opportunity , dived down the inside , and took third . Barrichello sheepishly followed him past Hakkinen , leaving a trail of cars bottled up behind the BAR . Villeneuve was driving his heart out at his home circuit , but his position meant that Schumacher was now twenty seconds ahead of the second placed man , and no - one would be able to match his pace until they got past the BAR Honda . The BAR star was clearly becoming a hindrance to Barrichello and Hakkinen , but proving why he is rated so highly among team managers along the pitlane . By lap 24 , the car beneath him would allow him to stay ahead no longer . Barrichello got a run at the BAR at the first chicane , but Villeneuve forced the Brazilian to do the hard work and held his line to put Barrichello on the outside for the second part of the corner . Through the second chicane , both Ferrari and BAR were side by side , neither giving an inch . It was the kind of racing that F1 fans have experienced only sporadically for many years , and Villeneuve could uphold his honour as one of the sport 's top dogs . Barrichello , though , held his nerve , and dived down the inside into the Casino hairpin . This time , there was nothing the ' 97 Champion could do , and was forced to cede . The early moves were being made by the Arrows drivers - light on fuel and enjoying good handling . Pedro de la Rosa took sixth from Heinz Harald Frentzen at the hairpin , then set about chasing Hakkinen 's McLaren , but prodigious though the Supertec-powered Arrows is , the Spaniard could not work it close enough on the straight to challenge . The Arrows were performing well in the early stages of the race , and Jos Verstappen echoed his team - mate 's performance by taking tenth from Giancarlo Fisichella 's Benetton . The car was obviously well balanced and allowed the drivers to exploit its capabilities , as Verstappen 's charge continued unabated even as the rain started to fall . Indeed , the Dutchman appeared to be in his element . De La Rosa , who was the first driver to stop , on lap 20 , had a little more trouble adjusting to the conditions and was off the road several times . He was off the road for good , and in the biggest possible way , when Pedro Diniz 's Sauber simply drove him into the barriers along the back straight as his namesake tried to pass . It was a worrying incident , and one that the stewards were considering action over as the race ended . Verstappen , on the other hand , kept on getting better the wetter the conditions got . With ten laps to go , he had shaken out in eighth place . After a tussle with Ralf Schumacher , the Dutchman latched onto the group of lower points - scoring places . Quickly he caught and passed Alexander Wurz 's Benetton , and set about chasing down Jarno Trulli in the Jordan . Within a couple of laps he was right with the Italian , and pulled ahead with a demon move from way back , into the third chicane on lap 59 . He held fifth until the end to score his first points of the year . Barrichello , releasedafter passing Villeneuve , darted away and by lap 31 was lapping at the same pace as his team - mate . On lap 31 he had surpassed it , setting the fastest lap of the race thus far . He took the lead when Schumacher pitted , and pulled slowly away , his lighter fuel load working to good effect . The Brazilian pitted on lap 43 , but lost the chance of a win in doing so . The following lap , Schumacher was in for wets , and had the Ferrari pit crew fitted these on Barrichello 's scheduled stop , he would have been uncatchable . It was not to be , however , and the precedence of his team mate within Ferrari played against him again . When he himself pited for wet tyres on th following tour , the pits were not ready for him , having just waved Schumacher away . He was forced to wait while , agonizingly , tyres were brought out of the garage and the warmers removed . He recovered to finish a strong second , having caught Schumacher in the final stages . He set fastest of the wet part of the race , and was clearly at one with the car and conditions . Another podium and six points was the reward . Biggest beneficiary of the rain was Giancarlo Fisichella , who jumped out of nowhere - the lower reaches of the top ten , to be precise - to take third . Hakkinen was , in contrast the biggest loser , as he had just passed the pit entrance as the rain began to fall . In consequence , he had to crawl round a lap on slicks , and ended the race behind Fisichella , in fourth .. The World Championship has thus swung back in favour of Schumacher and Ferrari . He now has a 22 point lead over Coulthard , and 24 points over Hakkinen . For full results , click here . To see the autosport.com lap-by-lap coverage , click here .

Welcome to Science Friday . MATT BERTONE : Oh , thank you for having me . IRA FLATOW : OK , tell us about this beetle . What is it , and where does it live ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so it 's a little , fairly nondescript beetle . And what we described was the actual larval stage , behaviors of the larval stage . But this species is common throughout Eastern North America , fairly small , and kind of obscure typically , so people do n't usually see it . The adults are small brown beetles with a very flattened body and two spots on the body . And the larvae are just small worm - like critters that crawl around under the bark of dead trees . IRA FLATOW : And you found this one actually on the bark on campus , right ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , that 's correct . There was a standing dead oak tree that was developing some fungus on it right outside of our building . And of course , because I pass it every day , I had to just collect some insects from it , especially for the specimens and my photography . And that 's\u2013 IRA FLATOW : This is what you do . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , yeah , this is what I do , so regular day for me . IRA FLATOW : Let 's talk about what makes this beetle and the larva so different from other jumping insects . MATT BERTONE : So , many adult insects jump . You think of crickets and grasshoppers . Even adult beetles , there are many species that jump . And they usually have large hind legs , and they just kind of launch off the surface . What this larva does , though , is very interesting . In fact , it builds up energy in its body and latches onto the ground with its claws . And as its body builds up energy , it releases those claws . And this causes the insect to somersault into the air a short distance . IRA FLATOW : And there 's nothing weird about the claws then . MATT BERTONE : Nope , they 're fairly typical larval claws . Nothing special really about them . IRA FLATOW : Well , if they live under the bark , why do they need to be able to jump ? They 're not going to be jumping any place under that bark , are they ? MATT BERTONE : Yes , so that 's a great question . And we 've been trying to figure out exactly why . The logic will be that since it 's under bark , it does n't need to jump , of course . So part of what we thought was maybe this is some artifact of a behavior they do under the bark . There are other larvae that are known to wedge push , so they kind of bump up a little bit under the bark to give it more space to crawl under . But we did n't think that was really the case . Why develop that behavior if you 're under bark most of the time ? Other beetles that have kind of jumping larvae often do that to escape predators or parasites . But we noticed that these larvae , you put them down on the ground , they crawl a little bit , and then they 'd hop on their own . You would n't have to kind of touch them or do anything to make them jump . So it came down to us thinking about their lifestyle . And my ideas and our thoughts were that this source , rotting wood and trees that are standing with bark that 's kind of falling off , could easily expose these larvae . And they 're light - colored . They 're on a dark surface . They could easily be picked off by predators . So one of my hypotheses is that they do this to get away from their sites , either when exposed or just because they want to . And it 's more energy effective to do that than to crawl . IRA FLATOW : Now you mentioned before that they 're not\u2013 how shall we say\u2013 great jumpers . And so the height of their jumping and their jumping ability , their talent for jumping is not what interests you , but it 's the way that they jump that interests you , right ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so they 're definitely not record setters . They 're definitely not even super impressive . They are when you see them with the naked eye because it 's fairly quick . But when we actually went to record the distance and the heights , they were not jumping very far , really . But beetle larvae jumping are really rare . And beetles are a huge group of insects . There are over 350,000 described species on Earth . And so you would think you would find it more commonly , but it 's actually fairly rare in beetles . And then the second aspect was the way they jumped using this latching mechanism with the ground is very unique . IRA FLATOW : And they do this pretty quickly because I was watching a video of your colleagues showing us how they jump , and you had to use a really high speed camera to see the details . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so Dr. Adrian Smith at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences downtown in Raleigh , one of his specialties is filming high speed videos of insects . And so this was a great collaboration . So when you see the jump with the naked eye , it 's very quick . When we showed it at 3,500 frames per second , we could see the basics of it . But he actually went to a special lab to get filming of 60,000 frames per second , in which we were able to see even more details . IRA FLATOW : Wow . Now does it matter what surface they are on ? If they have to use their claws to sort of set the spring in their body , right , does it matter that they 're on a slippery surface ? MATT BERTONE : So that 's actually one of the lines of evidence we used to show that this is actually a latching mechanism . Adrian did film some on Plexiglas and glass surfaces , and they were unable to jump . So that leads us to believe that they really do need something to latch on with their claws . IRA FLATOW : Do you get the impression that this is a talent that , evolutionarily speaking , they had to develop a little bit later in their evolution because they just do n't have the jumping body style that the other big jumpers have ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , this seems to be \u2013 I 'm not sure when they developed it , but it does seem to be a fairly simplistic way to do it if you think about it because most insects have claws . And they 're crawling on the surface . They can grab down . So it really did n't require any specialized anatomy that in many insects that do have those special organs to latch and jump , they did n't have to evolve those . IRA FLATOW : I kind of find it interesting that after the jump is finished , they sort of curl up into a little ring and then bounce around on as they land . It 's like a tire . It reminded me of a tire , right ? MATT BERTONE : Exactly , I love the little bounces when they hit the ground . I do n't know how they feel when they 're doing that . Luckily , they 're pretty light animals , and they can resist it . And yeah , it 's pretty erratic , their jumping . They do n't really aim somewhere . They 're not trying to get somewhere special , but we think that it helps kind of introduce different areas for them to explore . IRA FLATOW : Do you have any feeling about what actually makes them jump\u2013 loud noises ? Do you have to poke them ? What 's the stimulus there ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so they seemed to just jump when they were kind of exposed out in the open , crawling around . That was what led us to believe that it was n't so much them directly responding to some kind of predator or parasite . You could grab them with the soft forceps or touch them with a paintbrush , and they 'd crawl along and jump . But even if they were put out on the surface alone with no kind of stimulation like that , they would crawl around for a bit and then jump . And so that 's what we were able to observe with the specimens we had . But unfortunately , we do n't have a lot of live specimens to experiment with . So a lot of that stuff is still a mystery . IRA FLATOW : And to bring that up , to take that one step further , I noticed that when you posted this behavior online , other folks had seen it , too , in their species . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , that \u2013 IRA FLATOW : So you found other comrades . MATT BERTONE : That was one of the greatest things about this . Actually , in fact , it was really interesting . So we talk about these jumping larvae . Under the same bark with these larvae , there were also fly maggots . And many maggots are known to jump . And what they do is they latch their mouth parts onto their rear end and then stretch their body and then releasing that energy . So they use a body - to - body latch . But at the end of a video that Adrian produced about those jumping maggots , he alluded to and showed a clip of this beetle larva jumping just as a teaser . And out of the blue , he got a message from a Japanese researcher , Takehiro Yoshida . And he is a world expert on this group of beetles . And because he collects them , he had noticed one of his larvae doing the same thing . And this was actually from a different genus across the world in Japan . So it 's really interesting that it evolved at least twice in these beetles . IRA FLATOW : So it 's possible that this is more common than you know about . MATT BERTONE : Yes , and that would be great to find out how common . But again , these are very obscure , little critters that not a lot of people pay attention to . IRA FLATOW : Well , we have a big audience . So if people are listening , and they want to do some of their own research , can they look for these under the bark of their own trees ? MATT BERTONE : They could . These beetles are associated with kind of micro fungi that are under dead and dying trees , the bark of them . They can be found under the bark of logs on the ground , things like that . They 're not uncommon , and there 's other groups of beetle larvae and insect larvae that would be associated with those fungi . So you 're going to find a lot of different things to observe . If you do that , I would just make sure to be careful to leave some habitat left and to replace bark and things like that to just make sure that the insects and other arthropods have a good home . IRA FLATOW : Do they have a jumping signature that if I peeled up the bark and I looked and I saw there were a lot of other insects and larvae under there , that I would say , hey , look , it 's jumping in a certain way . That 's the one . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , so I 'd be interested to see , opening up the bark and seeing a bunch of larvae , if you could just sit back and watch and see if they jump . We as scientists would always want to collect those specimens then and get them identified for sure , which was actually the first step of the process , was finding out what type of larva it was , because we actually did DNA work to link it to the adults , and we got confirmation through identification keys . It was really exciting to know that we had seen something possibly the first time and definitely reported for the first time . IRA FLATOW : You mean the reporting the jumping of it . MATT BERTONE : Yeah , exactly . So we do n't know without publications whether people have seen it before . Somebody could have just been tearing up a box , saw a little beetle , a little larva or grub jumping around , and thought , ah , well , whatever . But recognizing the importance is really a part of it . IRA FLATOW : Now I noticed in the video I was watching that you guys went through great trouble to scan the larva , to look at , poke it , see in every direction that you can . Is there still something you do n't know about it that you would like to know ? MATT BERTONE : Yeah , I think we would definitely like to have or would have liked to have more specimens to kind of do some more experiments , like manipulating them on different surfaces or doing different experiments to see what might cause them to do this jumping behavior . Again , they 're very ephemeral . It 's hard to pinpoint where they 're going to be and collect a number of the specimens to experiment on . It 's not like a pest species that 's so common or something that we keep in colonies . So that 's where one of the difficulties comes about . IRA FLATOW : So you do n't want our listeners sending you their samples that they 're collecting \u2013 MATT BERTONE : I mean \u2013 IRA FLATOW : \u2013from their trees . MATT BERTONE : I 'd love to see some . I mean , I love seeing the diversity of all the things under there . I also do n't want everybody to kind of go out and collecting all these things without kind of proper methods and whatnot . But yeah , I would love to see if people have photos of these things or videos or have the specimens alive , reach out to me , and I 'd love to help you identify them . But there are a lot of different ones under the bark , so you may get confused . IRA FLATOW : OK , well , there you go . There 's the challenge to all of you . If you 've got something , you can contact Matt at NC State University . Thank you , Dr. Bertone , for taking time to be with us today . MATT BERTONE : Of course . Thank you very much to you , too .

It was 2009 . Two young female goalies Griffin knew had been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Griffin , associate head coach for the University of Washington 's women 's soccer team , had started to visit the women and other athletes in local hospitals , helping them pass the time during chemo with war stories from her three decades of coaching . That day , the nurse looked down at the woman Griffin was sitting with and said , \" Do n't tell me you guys are goalkeepers . You 're the fourth goalkeeper I 've hooked up this week . \" Later , the young woman with the chemo needle in her arm would say , \u201c I just have a feeling it has something to do with those black dots . \u201d Artificial turf fields are now everywhere in the United States , from high schools to multi-million - dollar athletic complexes . As any parent or player who has been on them can testify , the tiny black rubber crumbs of which the fields are made -- chunks of old tires -- get everywhere . In players ' uniforms , in their hair , in their cleats . But for goalkeepers , whose bodies are in constant contact with the turf , it can be far worse . In practices and games , they make hundreds of dives , and each plunge sends a black cloud of tire pellets into the air . The granules get into their cuts and scrapes , and into their mouths . Griffin wondered if those crumbs \u2013 which have been known to contain carcinogens and chemicals \u2013 were making players sick . \u201c I've coached for 26 , 27 years , \u201d she said . \u201c My first 15 years , I never heard anything about this . All of a sudden it seems to be a stream of kids . \u201d Since then , Griffin has compiled a list of 38 American soccer players -- 34 of them goalies \u2013 who have been diagnosed with cancer . At least a dozen played in Washington , but the geographic spread is nationwide . Blood cancers like lymphoma and leukemia dominate the list . No research has linked cancer to artificial turf . Griffin collected names through personal experience with sick players , and acknowledges that her list is not a scientific data set . But it 's enough to make her ask whether crumb rubber artificial turf , a product that has been rolled out in tens of thousands of parks , playgrounds , schools and stadiums in the U.S. , is safe for the athletes and kids who play on it . Others across the country are raising similar questions , arguing that the now-ubiquitous material , made out of synthetic fibers and scrap tire -- which can contain benzene , carbon black and lead , among other substances -- has not been adequately tested . Few studies have measured the risk of ingesting crumb rubber orally , for example . NBC 's own extensive investigation , which included a review of the relevant studies and interviews with scientists and industry professionals , was unable to find any agreement over whether crumb turf had ill effects on young athletes , or even whether the product had been sufficiently tested . The Synthetic Turf Council , an industry group , says that the evidence collected so far by scientists and state and federal agencies proves that artificial turf is safe . \u201c We 've got 14 studies on our website that says we can find no negative health effects , \u201d said Dr. Davis Lee , a Turf Council board member . While those studies are n't \u201c absolutely conclusive , \u201d he added , \u201c There 's certainly a preponderance of evidence to this point that says , in fact , it is safe . \u201d Do You or Your Kids Play on Synthetic Fields ? Share Your Story Environmental advocates want the Environmental Protection Agency and the Consumer Product Safety Commission to take a closer look . While both the CPSC and the EPA performed studies over five years ago , both agencies recently backtracked on their assurances the material was safe , calling their studies \u201c limited . \u201d But while the EPA told NBC News in a statement that \u201c more testing needs to be done , \u201d the agency also said it considered artificial turf to be a \u201c state and local decision , \u201d and would not be commissioning further research . \u201c There 's a host of concerns that are being raised , \u201d said Jeff Ruch , executive director of PEER , an environmental watchdog group . PEER has lodged complaints against both agencies . \u201c None have risen to the level of regulatory interest . \u201d The EPA refused multiple requests from NBC News for an interview , and declined to expand on their statement that \u201c more testing needs to be done . \u201d From ' Chemgrass ' to crumb rubber Invented in 1964 by Monsanto , the first iterations of artificial turf were little more than synthetic ' grass ' laid on top of concrete . First called \u201c ChemGrass , \u201d the product became famous as \u201c AstroTurf \u201d after it was installed in Houston 's Astrodome in 1966 . Some athletes , however , complained that the thin , synthetic surface made for hard landings . By the early 2000s , a better form of artificial turf had emerged . Called styrene butadiene rubber , or \u201c crumb rubber , \u201d the new turf contained tiny black crumbs made from pulverized car tires , poured in between the fake grass blades . The rubber infill gave the field more bounce , cushioned the impact for athletes , and helped prevent serious injuries like concussions . Since then , the material has become increasingly popular . Municipalities across the country have floated multi-million - dollar bonds to pay for new fields . Local leaders , some facility managers and companies say that turf costs less than natural grass to maintain , and can withstand heavy use year - round . \u201c There are benefits here . The potential risk , as we know it today , is extremely low . \u201d Today , according to figures from the Synthetic Turf Council , more than 11,000 synthetic turf sports fields are in use in the U.S. Most of them are crumb rubber . Crumb rubber infill is also used in children 's playgrounds across the country . Crumb rubber is an \u201c environmental success story , \u201d said Dan Zielinski , spokesperson for the Rubber Manufacturers Association . Not only have turf fields diverted millions of tires from landfills , said Zielinski , but they do n't require fertilizer or pesticides , and can save municipalities hundreds of thousands of gallons of water each year . \u201c There are benefits here , \u201d Zielinski said . \u201c The potential risk , as we know it today , is extremely low . \u201d ' Turf Bugs ' Jordan Swarthout , 22 , started playing soccer when she was 4 . She became a goalie at 9 , already addicted to the \u201c adrenaline rush \u201d that comes each time the ball hurtles toward the net . By 11 , Swarthout , who grew up in Sumner , Washington , about 45 minutes south of Seattle , was playing almost entirely on crumb rubber turf . When she and her team asked what was in the turf , \u201c old tires \u201d was the best answer she got . \u201c We always wondered what was underneath it , \u201d she said . \u201c What we could n't see . \u201d But the smell that hangs over crumb rubber fields \u2013 the scent of tires baking in the sun -- became as familiar to Swarthout as her endless goalie drills . She even got used to the \u201c turf bugs , \u201d as she and her teammates called them . During high school , she played on multiple teams at once , with two - hour practices five days a week , and games at least twice a week . Every day , she tried to clean the black rubber pellets , the \u201c turf bugs , \u201d out of the abrasions and burns she suffered as a goalkeeper on turf . Every day , to the chagrin of her mother , she shook them from her clothes and cleats onto the laundry room floor . She brushed them out of her hair , and spit them out of her mouth . \" The little black beads , \" she said . \" In the games and practices they 'd get in my eyes , they 'd get in my mouth , they 'd get in my nose . My mom would get so mad at me because I 'd go to the bathroom to take a shower , and the turf bugs would be everywhere . \u201d Jordan 's mother , Suzie Swarthout , said her daughter probably swallowed hundreds of tire crumbs a year . Yet neither Jordan nor Suzie worried much about it . \u201c We all had the confidence that the proper steps had been taken , the research had been done , that it had been proved to be safe , \u201d said Suzie . \u201c We all know how bad tires are , \u201d said Jordan . \u201c You do n't eat tires . Yet we were . You 'd get it in your mouth and you would n't think about it . \u201d In 2013 , after more than a year of mysterious thyroid problems , a biopsy determined that the star athlete had stage three Hodgkin lymphoma . It was one night this past May , months after doctors declared her daughter to be in remission , when Suzie Swarthout saw Amy Griffin 's story on a local news broadcast . \u201c I immediately after the newscast emailed [ Amy ] and said , \u201c You could add another subject to your statistics , ' \u201d recalled Suzie . Griffin said that since she first started collecting names of goalies with cancer and other diseases , she 's had people like the Swarthouts contact her , and her list has grown . Griffin and the Swarthouts said that they know it 's nearly impossible to figure out the origin of a disease like cancer , and that young people are exposed to hundreds of carcinogens . But , said Jordan Swarthout , \u201c If we have it available to us to research this , why should n't we ? Why ca n't we ? \" ' Every tire is different ' One of the problems with researching the potential health hazards of crumb rubber fields is the sheer variety of materials used in the product . Tens of thousands of different tires from different brands may be used in one field . According to the EPA , mercury , lead , benzene , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , and arsenic , among several other chemicals , heavy metals , and carcinogens , have been found in tires . Darren Gill , vice president of marketing for FieldTurf , a prominent turf company , said that those ingredients might worry consumers , but the manufacturing process ensures that their product is safe . \u201c If you look at the ingredients that go into a car tire , some people take those ingredients and turn them into health concerns , \u201d Gill said . \u201c But after the vulcanization process , those ingredients are inert . \u201d Industry leaders say while they encourage additional research , studies have shown that the substances found in crumb rubber are not at levels high enough to be at risk to children or athletes . \u201c There are certainly chemicals in small amounts [ in turf ] as in many other things , \u201d said Lee , of the Synthetic Turf Council . \u201c You could evaluate most any material out there and you 're going to find at some level , some chemical that might cause concern . \u201d \u201c The levels as they exist in tires , ground up tires , are very , very low , \u201d he added . \u201c The EPA has not found adverse health effect . Several state organizations have investigated it quite thoroughly . \u201d Existing research has attempted to measure the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals through the inhalation of gasses and particulate matter , as well as skin contact . Studies have found that crumb rubber fields emit gases that can be inhaled . Turf fields can become very hot -- 10 to 15 degrees hotter than the ambient temperature \u2013 increasing the chances that volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ) and chemicals can \u201c off - gas , \u201d or leach into the air . One study performed by the state of Connecticut measured the concentrations of VOCs and chemicals in the air over fields . In addition to VOCs such as benzene and methylene chloride , researchers identified various polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( PAHs ) . The report concluded that \u201c the use of outdoor and indoor artificial turf fields is not associated with elevated health risks , \u201d but that more research was needed to better understand chemical exposures on outdoor fields during hot weekends and in indoor facilities , which showed higher levels of chemicals in the air . Other studies have looked at whether run-off from crumb rubber turf is harmful to aquatic life , or whether the rate of injury on turf is lower than on natural grass . Few studies have looked at the issues unique to goalkeepers \u2013 whether ingesting the particles by mouth or absorbing them into the body through cuts and scrapes is dangerous . While many studies conclude that the fields studied do not present acute health risks , they often add the caveat that more research should be conducted . - One , published in 2013 in the scientific journal Chemospheres , which analyzed rubber mulch and rubber mats , concluded that , \u201c Uses of recycled rubber tires , especially those targeting play areas and other facilities for children , should be a matter of regulatory concern . \u201d - A 2006 Norwegian study evaluated inhalation , ingestion and skin exposure to crumb rubber in indoor fields . Researchers identified VOCs such as xylene , acetone and styrene , in the air above the fields . The study determined that inhalation of such compounds would not cause \u201c acute harmful effects \u201d to health , but that it was \u201c not possible \u2026 to carry out a complete health risk assessment . \u201d Researchers also concluded that oral exposure to artificial turf would not cause increased health risk . - Another 2013 study attempted to measure ingestion , inhalation and dermal exposure risk to users , and determined that the fields presented little risk . But researchers identified lead in the turf tested , including a \u201c large concentration \u201d of lead and chromium in one sample . \u201c As the turf material degrades from weathering the lead could be released , potentially exposing young children , \u201d the report states . According to Dr. Joel Forman , associate professor of pediatrics and preventive medicine at New York 's Mt. Sinai Hospital , in all these studies , data gaps make it difficult to draw firm conclusions . \u201c None of [ the studies ] are long term , they rarely involve very young children and they only look for concentrations of chemicals and compare it to some sort of standard for what 's considered acceptable , \u201d said Dr. Forman . \u201c That does n't really take into account subclinical effects , long - term effects , the developing brain and developing kids . \u201d Forman said that it is known that some of the compounds found in tires , \u201c even in chronic lower exposures \u201d can be associated with subtle neurodevelopmental issues in children . \u201c Those are always suspect , \u201d he said . \u201c If you never study anything , \u201d said Dr. Forman , \u201c you can always say , ' Well there 's no evidence that 's a problem , ' but that 's because you have n't looked . To look is hard . \u201d \u201c I would like to see some more research , \u201d he concluded . ' Not an Issue ' It is unlikely , however , that further research will be conducted by federal agencies . In 2008 , tests performed by New Jersey found lead on three artificial turf fields . The results spurred media coverage and concern across the country . The Consumer Product Safety Commission , the federal agency in charge of regulating consumer products , tested turf samples . While the tests detected lead in the synthetic grass blades , the agency announced that turf was safe to play on . That same year , an official from a regional EPA office wrote to three agency offices in D.C. , including the Office of Children 's Health Protection , and recommended that the EPA undertake extensive testing , according to documents obtained by the watchdog group PEER . \u201c My staff has reviewed the published research on the safety of tire crumb , \u201d wrote the official , \u201c and has found information suggesting that children 's chronic , repeated exposure to tire crumb could present health hazards . However , sufficient data to quantify toxicological risks from tire crumb exposure are not available . \u201d Shortly after , the EPA tested samples from two artificial turf fields and one playground . The concentrations of VOCs and other chemicals researchers found presented a \u201c low level of concern , \u201d the agency reported , but it declared that due to the \u201c very limited nature \u201d of the study and the diversity of crumb material , it was \u201c not possible to reach any more comprehensive conclusions without the consideration of additional data . \u201d While the industry cites both studies as evidence that rubber crumb is safe , in response to complaints filed by PEER , both the CPSC and the EPA declared last year that their studies were limited in scope . In its press release , the CPSC wrote , \u201c The exposure assessment did not include chemicals or other toxic metals , beyond lead . \u201d Since its initial tests , according to the CPSC , the agency has worked with the industry to develop voluntary standards for lead content . The EPA refused repeated requests from NBC News for an interview . It said in a statement that the agency \u201c does not believe that the field monitoring data collected provides evidence of an elevated health risk resulting from the use of recycled tire crumb in playgrounds or in synthetic turf athletic fields . \u201d \u201c The agency believes that more testing needs to be done , \u201d said the agency in a separate statement , \u201c but , currently , the decision to use tire crumb remains a state and local decision . \u201d When NBC News first contacted the EPA in 2013 , Enesta Jones , an agency spokesperson said that in 2010 , after a meeting with state and federal officials , \u201c EPA determined that this is not an issue . \u201d The agency does not have plans to conduct further studies , but is currently working on a \u201c summary \u201d of available research . New Controversy Others across the country say their questions about crumb rubber turf remain unanswered . Some cities have elected to scrap crumb rubber turf in favor of alternative infill . The New York City Parks Department stopped installing crumb rubber turf in 2008 followed the next year by the Los Angeles Unified School District . In Maryland , a group called the Safe Healthy Playing Fields Coalition has been organizing against a bill that would allocate state funds to build artificial turf fields . The group has also been trying to advance legislation that would require warning signs to be placed around artificial turf fields . For at least four years , citizens and advocacy groups concerned about crumb rubber turf have been fighting against the installation of artificial fields in San Francisco 's Golden Gate Park . Early this year , a judge dismissed a suit against the city that alleged the environmental impact report conducted by the city violated California law by failing to disclose the risks associated with turf . The case is currently being appealed . Two turf - related propositions are on the ballot for the city 's upcoming elections . One would bar the city from installing the fields in Golden Gate Park , and the other would give wider latitude to the city 's Parks and Recreation department to install similar projects . Those concerned about turf suggest using alternative in - fill for artificial fields , such as coconut fiber and cork , or prohibiting toddlers or other young children from using fields and playgrounds with crumb rubber . An environmental group called the Center for Environmental Health ( CEH ) led litigation against several artificial turf companies in California for violations of Proposition 65 , a state law that prohibits companies from knowingly exposing consumers to specific chemicals and heavy metals , such as lead , without clear warning . In a series of settlements , the companies agreed to reduce the amount of lead in their products sold in California and agreed to replace fields under certain conditions . Caroline Cox , research director for CEH , said that while studies have n't definitively established that crumb rubber turf is harmful , the surface contains chemicals known to be hazardous . \u201c We know they 're there , \u201d said Cox . \u201c The point is , let 's go with better alternatives instead of spending years and millions of dollars establishing harm . If there 's a better way to do this , let 's just do it . \u201d Follow NBC News Investigations on Twitter and Facebook . \u201c Turf fields come with a number of real risks and a number of real benefits , \u201d said Dr. Joel Forman . \u201c And every community \u2026 has to kind of weigh the different risks and benefits . \u201d Looking for answers When Amy Griffin first started using turf -- her team practices on it throughout the year -- she thought it was a \u201c win - win . \u201d Now , her team collects paper cups of crumb rubber on each field they play on , handing them off to her so she can ship the granules to a lab to be tested . \u201c I 'm looking for answers , because I 'm not smart enough to come up with them on my own , \u201d Griffin said . \u201c I would love someone to say , ' We 've done some tests and we 've covered all of our bases . \u2026 And yes , it 's safe . ' That would be awesome . \u2026 I would love to be proved wrong . \u201d"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

CDC recommends washing hands with soap and water whenever possible because handwashing reduces the amounts of all types of germs and chemicals on hands . But if soap and water are not available , using a hand sanitizer with at least 60 % alcohol can help you avoid getting sick and spreading germs to others . The guidance for effective handwashing and use of hand sanitizer in community settings was developed based on data from a number of studies . Why ? Soap and water are more effective than hand sanitizers at removing certain kinds of germs , like Cryptosporidium , norovirus , and Clostridium difficile 1 - 5 . Although alcohol - based hand sanitizers can inactivate many types of microbes very effectively when used correctly 1 - 15 , people may not use a large enough volume of the sanitizers or may wipe it off before it has dried 14 . Why ? Many studies show that hand sanitizers work well in clinical settings like hospitals , where hands come into contact with germs but generally are not heavily soiled or greasy 16 . Some data also show that hand sanitizers may work well against certain types of germs on slightly soiled hands 17,18 . However , hands may become very greasy or soiled in community settings , such as after people handle food , play sports , work in the garden , or go camping or fishing . When hands are heavily soiled or greasy , hand sanitizers may not work well 3,7,16 . Handwashing with soap and water is recommended in such circumstances . Why ? Although few studies have been conducted , hand sanitizers probably cannot remove or inactivate many types of harmful chemicals . In one study , people who reported using hand sanitizer to clean hands had increased levels of pesticides in their bodies 19 . If hands have touched harmful chemicals , wash carefully with soap and water ( or as directed by a poison control center ) . Why ? Many studies have found that sanitizers with an alcohol concentration between 60\u201395 % are more effective at killing germs than those with a lower alcohol concentration or non-alcohol - based hand sanitizers 16,20 . Hand sanitizers without 60 - 95 % alcohol 1 ) may not work equally well for many types of germs ; and 2 ) merely reduce the growth of germs rather than kill them outright . Why ? The steps for hand sanitizer use are based on a simplified procedure recommended by CDC 21 . Instructing people to cover all surfaces of both hands with hand sanitizer has been found to provide similar disinfection effectiveness as providing detailed steps for rubbing - in hand sanitizer 22 . Why ? Ethyl alcohol ( ethanol ) - based hand sanitizers are safe when used as directed , 23 but they can cause alcohol poisoning if a person swallows more than a couple of mouthfuls 24 . From 2011 \u2013 2015 , U.S. poison control centers received nearly 85,000 calls about hand sanitizer exposures among children 25 . Children may be particularly likely to swallow hand sanitizers that are scented , brightly colored , or attractively packaged . Hand sanitizers should be stored out of the reach of young children and should be used with adult supervision . Child - resistant caps could also help reduce hand sanitizer - related poisonings among young children 24 . Older children and adults might purposefully swallow hand sanitizers to become drunk 26 . - Barbee SL , Weber DJ , Sobsey MD , Rutala WA .

Zinedine Zidane , who watched on from the touchline in Cardiff , volleyed in an all - time great final goal way back in 2002 - but how does Mandzukic 's stand up ? Great games are often graced by great moments but few , if any , have seen a goal as good as Mario Mandzukic 's against Real Madrid . After Cristiano Ronaldo had given the Spanish champions the lead early Juventus were dragged back on level terms by a goal of supreme quality from Croatian Mandzukic . After a cross - field ball to Alex Sandro was crossed back into Gonzalo Higuain whose chested pass was brought down with precision before being fired , over his shoulder into the net by Mandzukic leaving Keylor Navas in the Real goal with no chance . Zinedine Zidane , who watched on from the touchline in Cardiff , volleyed in an all - time great final goal way back in 2002 while Lionel Messi 's 2011 effort was another spectacular piece of individual brilliance . So where does Mandzukic 's effort rank ? Our writers have their say : Miguel Delaney A goal made in the air , and above it only sky ? This was a level above in so many ways . It was also fitting that Mario Mandzukic 's 27th - minute goal came against Zinedine Zidane , because the instant question was whether it betters the Real Madrid manager 's famous strike from 2002 against Bayer Leverkesen . It was that good , and has that kind of claim . One way it was certainly better than Zidane 's was in the build - up . While that 2002 volley came from a deflected cross , this was from the most supreme and vaunted game of heads and volleys that has ever been seen . Leo Bonucci pinged the ball to Alex Sandro , he sent it across for Gonzalo Higuain , who chested it and teed it up for Mandzukic . Three players , four touches , and not a single touch of the ground until the ball hit the net . As regards how it got to the net , Mandzukic 's arched overhead was exquisite , but probably did n't quite have the purity of strike of Zidane 's volley , that was technically harder to pull off and keep down . It is also open to debate whether Keylor Navas - or simply a taller goalkeeper , like say David De Gea - should have saved it . So , while this was a better team goal , Zidane 's was maybe a better single strike . From there , it comes down to preference . Ed Malyon Start with Leo Bonucci 's raking ball , and Alex Sandro volleying it back across . Gonzalo Higuain had lots of work to do , but he chested it , keeping it close , and he looped it into the path of Mario Mandzukic . Mario , formerly of Atletico Madrid , then executed a bicycle kick of ludicrous technical excellence , looping over Keylor Navas and levelling the Champions League final . Zinedine Zidane 's volley was one hit . A sensational one but just one hit . This was a move where the ball did n't even bounce in Real Madrid 's half . It was a team goal of barely believable touch and technique . It was exquisite . It was the best . Luke Brown Zinedine Zidane 's goal against Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 final was world - class , but he had so much time to adjust his body position and wait for the ball to drop , with Leverkusen 's defence nowhere to be seen by the time he had volleyed the ball into the back of the net . Mandzukic did n't have that luxury . With two defenders bearing down on him , and with his body awkwardly twisted away from goal , his was a purely instinctive finish . And then there was the build - up play leading up to the finish : Bonucci 's fine long - ball forward , Alex Sandro 's perfectly weighted cutback , Higuain 's control under pressure \u2026 An outrageous goal that will be remembered for years to come . Ben Burrows Cometh the hour , cometh the man and I wo n't argue strongly that Mandzukic 's sublime effort here is n't the best goal we 've ever seen on such a stage . To control the ball , have the sixth sense of where the goal is , and then to volley it over the shoulder into the one place the goalkeeper could n't reach was truly majestic . But give me Zidane , just . That volley is one for the ages , a hit so clean you would n't match it in a million attempts in your back garden . It was the crowning moment of a truly great player 's truly great career . So I 'll go with that , but only just .

Springs Memorial Endowed Scholarship that will help eligible Porter-Billups Leadership Academy ( PBLA ) alumni attend Regis University .

He was joined in 2006 by NBA star Chauncey Billups with a goal to provide students that qualify for admittance to Regis University , scholarships for tuition and fees . Walter Springs was enrolled in Regis College in 1939 and had to take scholarships and work two part-time jobs to pay for his education . \u201c He was curious about Catholicism , \u201d said his niece Meredith Springs - Levert . \u201c What got him interested in Regis was his affiliation with Sacred Heart Church and the priests there . \u201d In 1938 , Denver native Walter Springs , a Black man , enrolled in to Regis College as a freshman . The youngest of eleven children , he was the first in his family to go to college . Springs was known for his kindness and sense of humor -- he also boxed and played fullback on the football team for Regis College . \u201c The fact that he even went to Regis and worked two jobs tells you what kind of sacrifice it meant , \u201d said his niece . Springs converted to Catholicism and was even voted the school 's \u201c Most Popular Student \u201d in 1941 . A few months later , he left college to serve his country in a segregated US Army during World War II . \u201c He believed it was his patriotic duty , \u201d Springs - Levert said . \u201c There was a widely held thought at that period that Black people , if you served your country , you were a good upright citizen . \u201d Like most young men who fought in World War II , Springs never came back . But his death did n't happen overseas , he lost his life before he even left the country . On December 17 , 1942 , Sgt. Walter Springs was shot and killed by a white military police officer in a Texas caf\u00e9 , a few miles from the Army base where he was about to report for officer training . \u201c He gets off the train an goes into the caf\u00e9 , \u201d Springs - Levert said . \u201c MP 's asked him about a pass , and he said ' Yes , I have a pass but address me according to my rank ' . That was not going to fly with these 3 White MP's and what ended up was this altercation around his willingness to comply because he was being ' uppity ' . \u201d That 's when his family believes Walter Springs lost his life . \u201c He was shot when he was laying down , had defensive wounds on his hands where he was probably hit with something , and had a mark on the side of his face , \u201d his niece said . \u201c What we now learn is that his story was not an uncommon story for a lot of African - American soldiers during World War II . \u201d After his death in 1942 , Walter Springs ' classmates at Regis raised money and set up a scholarship in his name for racial justice and equity through education . \u201c The whole idea was to start a scholarship that would bring one Black kid and one White kid to Regis \u201d Springs - Levert said . Over time , donations declined , and the money ran out until recently when the school partnered with the PBLA to re-instate the scholarship that still bears Walter 's name . \u201c The scholarship honors the legacy and the sacrifice of Mr. Springs who epitomized the Jesuit values of service and justice , \u201d said Regis University President Rev. John P. Fitzgibbons , S.J. \u201c We want to graduate outstanding citizens who are able to think clearly and communicate justice clearly and are rooted in our Jesuit and Catholic values . \u201d \u201c The response from the students and from the faculty and the president has been overwhelming , \u201d Springs - Levert said . \u201c The commitment to re-instate that has just put us all over the moon . \u201d Walter Springs ' family hopes the scholarship will serve as an inspiration and as reminder of a former student who gave all he could . \u201c Nothing can bring Walt back , but people can know about who he was , \u201d his niece said . \u201c They can know what he stood for and that he made an awful sacrifice and our family made a sacrifice . Somebody can benefit from it in terms of getting an education and living out that dream that he had , and our family had for him . \u201d SUGGESTED VIDEOS : Education stories from 9NEWS"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Lamberto Leoni ( Mario Andretti ) What ? Ensign-Cosworth N177 ( Lotus -Cosworth 78 ) Where ? Long Beach When ? 1978 US West GP ( qualifying on 1 April 1978 ) Why ? With his single GP start Lamberto Leoni achieved more than he managed as a Formula One team owner ! His final try in the spring of 1978 , here pictured at Long Beach during practice , led to another DNQ and the end of a very short Grand Prix career . A decade later , Leoni was back on the brink of F1 , now proudly presenting his First F1 car to the press . Its lines , penned by respected Brazilian designer Richard Divila , looked promising . But although it was tested at the hands of Gabriele Tarquini , the car never raced . Or did it ? In its First life the car remained stillborn , but it got an unexpected second , erm , Life . After Leoni's F1 plans were scuppered he sought ways to cut his losses . Soon he found his victim in the shape of one Ernesto Vita , the Italian businessman who had already been fooled by veteran ex- Ferrari engineer Franco Rocchi , who had been involved with the Scuderia since 1949 . The man had some fame for having a part in the great Ferrari flat - 12 , which must have meant to Vita that he had talent to throw away . Which was exactly what he did when coming up with his latest dream engine . Rocchi had convinced Vita to create Life Racing Engines as a vehicle for his aircraft - style W12 motor , which used a peculiar 4 - 4 - 4 configuration . Initially intended as test bed , the First 189 , now rechristened Life F190 , was extensively rebuilt to conform to FIA 's latest crash test regulations and could thus be promoted to race car . The idea of using such an outdated design to debut its revolutionary engine did n't seem a bright idea to followers at the time . Still , the 12 - team restriction being years away from entering the Concorde agreement , anyone could enter F1 and around 1990 the common feeling looked to be the more , the merrier indeed . Life 's subsequent disgrace as the worst modern - era Grand Prix team is fairly well documented , as the car was so hugely off the pace and unreliable at that , that we had to go back to Al Pease 's overambitious entry into F1 to find an effort that was similarly out of place . The engine reportedly produced a mere 360 bhp while McLaren 's Honda engine had about 800 bhp ! ' Nuff said Sticking a Judd V8 in the back - the engine the First was originally designed for - did n't help and the outfit folded before having to spend lashes of lire on the two Asia - Pacific long - haul events . Quickly , Leoni returned to his well - oiled F3000 enterprise and just as rival F3000 team DAMS never made it to F1 . Lamberto had started his association with the F1 junior category as a driver , though . In the series ' debut year , Leoni teamed up with the PMC outfit to form a driver pairing with Belgium 's Thierry Tassin . Like the Barron Racing team , which fielded Tyrrell 012s for Roberto Moreno and Claudio Langes , and Roger Cowman entering a sole Arrows A6 for Slim Borgudd , the two used the transitional rule that DFV - engined F1 cars were also eligible for the championship and thus ran a pair of Williams FW08Cs . It proved a disastrous decision as the pukka F3000 machinery such as the March 85 C or Ralt RT20 completely outclassed the ageing F1 cars . Tassin and Leoni always managed to finish but usually were several laps down , as last of the classified runners - that is , in case they managed to get classified at all . After the opening two British rounds the team wisely decided to skip Estoril . Tassin moved over to Eddie Jordan 's team , while Lamberto had to sit out the event . He returned with PMC for his home race at Vallelunga , but got involved in a tangle with Ivan Capelli 's Genoa March after just four laps . Then at Pau , there was a sudden upturn in fortunes , as Lamberto survived the usual Pau carnage at the infamous Foch Square to finish 3rd of the five remaining runners , while also finishing on the leader 's lap , ahead of Olivier Grouillard no less . PMC 's podium finish was the highest - ever finishing position for an F1 chassis during any F3000 event . But soon the team were back to its old ways . Spa saw another retirement while at Dijon Leoni was making up the rear as usual . After that , enough was enough and Lamberto grabbed the opportunity to replace Alain Fert\u00e9 in the Corbari Italia team , which was running Marches . At Enna , he took over the Frenchman 's seat but retired in the Sicilian heat waves . Then the F3000 circus moved to the \u00d6sterreichring and there Leoni equalled his best result , taking a fighting third right behind Ivan Capelli and John Nielsen 's Ralt . Again , it was reason for temporary happiness , as Leoni left Zandvoort with nothing to show for and showed similar lacklustre form at the final event at Donington . In 1986 , the quantity ( and quality ! ) of the F3000 field almost doubled compared to 1985 , Leoni decided to go his own way and entered a March 86 C as driver / team owner . The International Trophy at Silverstone , now part of the F3000 championship , was the first time First Racing entered a race . Leoni finished an undistinguished 11th . In the following races , the new combination only attracted attention by falling off at Vallelunga and in Belgium , and at Mugello Lamberto even faced the ignominy of not qualifying , with a repeat embarrassment at Zeltweg after crashing out during the warm - up session . It was a big hit and car nor driver were ready to enter the first Birmingham Superprix , nor were they present at the final two events at Le Mans and Jarama . Leoni was undeterred . For 1987 , he created a three - car Italian superteam which March - Mader 87 Bs for himself , Aldo Bertuzzi and star driver Gabriele Tarquini . Still in the first part of the season , a 6th for Leoni at Pau was the only reward , as the hapless Bertuzzi DNQ 'ed his heart out and Tarquini was found crashing his car at several events . Suddenly , at Enna , the disappointing Gabriele turned his form around and produced a podium finish for First , with Leoni taking 5th . Strangely , Tarquini was soon back to his habit of finishing last in a season dominated by Stefano Modena . But then Gabriele found new form as Modena won again at Imola . There the First team took its best result of the season , Tarquini finishing second and Leoni fourth . Even Bertuzzi managed to qualify and finish the race , albeit in last position . On a roll , Leoni and Tarquini took fourth and fifth at Le Mans -Bugatti , with the team boss taking another fourth at Jarama , where Claudio Langes replaced Bertuzzi . In the championship table , Leoni and his main man Tarquini finished equal 8th with 12 points each . 1988 was supposed to be Johnny Herbert 's year , as JH comfortably took the opening race at Jerez . Meanwhile , Leoni had decided to step down from his driving duties and managed to win a classy driving pairing for his March - Judd 88 Bs . Both Pierluigi Martini - two-timing with F1 after his mid-season return to Minardi - and Marco Apicella were hot title favourites and expectations ran high . After two strike - outs the season got underway for Martini with third at Pau , breathing down the neck of Jean Alesi . The team hen had to wait until Monza for Marco Apicella to put himself on the scoreboard , finishing runner - up to Bromley 's later champion Moreno . A couple of weeks later , at Enna , Martini won First 's first race , while at Brands he took second to Martin Donnelly and in Birmingham snatched the final podium spot . His F1 schedule clashing with the F3000 calendar , Martini chose to go to Estoril with Minardi , while Alain Fert\u00e9 subbed at the mini-sized Le Mans -Bugatti track . His return for the two final races went nowhere in the way of results . And so another season of high expectations had gone by without the success to show for it . Granted , the team had taken its first win but the mercurial Martini could - and should - have been a major detractor to Roberto Moreno 's title aspirations . As it was , he took a distant fourth in the championship . Thus it was not without surprise that Leoni launched his plan to move up to F1 . During the time the car was drawn , built and put through its first motions by Gabriele Tarquini , First had its usual F3000 business to take care of , and this was n't a job to be taken lightheartedly , as Leoni again decided to go for a three - car team , new team leader Apicella being joined by Fabrizio Giovanardi and later FIRST boss Jean - D\u00e9nis D\u00e9l\u00e9traz . Incidentally , Leoni's First squad should not mixed up with the French FIRST sportscar outfit formed by Fabien Giroix and D\u00e9l\u00e9traz some years ago Ironically , 1989 was to be First 's most successful season in F3000 , as young Giovanardi took a surprise victory in just his second race for the team while Apicella took several podiums to take fourth in the championship . If it had n't been for those quick and ultra-professional DAMS Lolas of Bernard and Comas and of course that man Jean Alesi Still , Marco had been in the thick of it during most of the races and looked like real championship material for 1990 . And so the F1 project was set aside to give Apicella a real shot at the title , supported by the same drivers as in 1989 , although D\u00e9l\u00e9traz was replaced by Marco Greco during the year . Also standing in the way of First 's F1 ambitions was F3000 chassis supplier March , which had just given First a semi-works status and was going from strength to strength themselves with their Adrian Newey -penned 881 . It is rumoured March more or less prohibited First to continue their F1 operation on the sanction of the Bicester factory withholding its support for Apicella 's title bid . All the more sadly that in the end it was n't to be , not by a long - shot . The 1990 season was all about the singularly efficient DAMS team , their Lolas only breaking under the hands of Allan McNish , while Erik Comas strolled to the championship , seemingly unperturbed . Apicella duly followed the DAMS cars home on many occasions but also had to contend with opposition from Forti's Gianni Morbidelli , Eddie Irvine in Jordan 's Camel Reynard and GA 's Eric van de Poele , who took three wins . While Van de Poele was easily Comas 's best opponent , Apicella 's form tailed off at the end of the season , hitting a low point with disqualification at Brands Hatch . Having lost Apicella 's services to Paul Stewart Racing for 1991 , First started all over with Reynard 91D chassis , Mader-tuned Cosworths , the returning D\u00e9l\u00e9traz , the promising Giovanni Bonanno and French hotshoe \u00c9ric H\u00e9lary , now an Opel DTM regular . The young Frenchman showed his speed on many occasions , but was unlucky to score just a third at Pau . While the season unfolded into a Zanardi / Fittipaldi benefit , the First team 's first shake - up came at the same classic track , where Bonanno - who later returned with a self - run Reynard - was released in favour of Steffi Graf 's boyfriend , Michael Bartels . A second blow followed when after Jerez D\u00e9l\u00e9traz left the team for the second time . He was not replaced . Then Bartels and H\u00e9lary failed to show up at Enna for the Gran Premio del Mediterraneo . It was the end of the line for First Racing , which came close to the championship on two occasions , only to have its foolhardy F1 ambition get in the way . By then the mantle of leading Italian F3000 team had long been taking over by Forti , Crypton and the lusciously named Il Barone Rampante , before F3000 domination also passed over to British teams . Having abandoned his F3000 outfit , Leoni followed in Didier Pironi 's footsteps in going for the ultimate modern - day danger ride : powerboat racing . This venture became rather more of a success , Lamberto taking many wins and almost taking the World Championship in 1993 . It would be cruel to say that Lamberto Leoni 's seven - year association with Formula 3000 left him with nothing . His team took just two wins but had been a front -runner at best and a mainstay at the least during its stay in the category . Last year , while still competing in offshore powerboat racing , Leoni even made a return to the junior formula , this time fielding a two - car entry under the Monaco Motorsport banner . Main drivers Thomas Biagi and Cyrille Sauvage seldomly starred and the outfit was relegated to Italian F3000 . Still , it was more than could be said of Leoni 's involvement in Formula One . Lamberto 's initial road to F1 was very similar to that of many of his countrymen , particularly that of Siegfried Stohr . Taking a Formula Italia title into F3 , Leoni regularly produced steady drives to some podium positions , but he never set the world alight with a particular performance . Then , after a slow start in a Ralt RT1 , Leoni signed to drive Scuderia Everest 's curious Ferrari V6-engined Chevron in the European F2 Championship . With this car he then proceeded to win the Adriatic GP at Misano on aggregate . Before that , he had n't scored a single top-six finish ! And he was n't in the remainder of the season A one - off rent -a-drive for Surtees in his 1977 home race preceded Leoni 's real F1 break . This came through Ensign 's Mo Nunn losing the services of Clay Regazzoni to Shadow . Two races into the season more woe followed for the little team as lead driver Danny Ongais quit , taking along his Interscope dollars to get himself a private Shadow . At Kyalami , Lamberto was thus promoted to the No.22 seat , the team now reduced to a single - car outfit . But with two more DNQs following - pictured is his last qualifying attempt - there was little chance of his staying with the team , especially now Nunn was able to lure the able Jacky Ickx into his pretty competent design - at least it was so the year before , as Ickx was about to find out , although the Belgian 's young replacement Derek Daly managed to grab a point with it in Canada . And what about Leoni ? For the next couple of years he was in and out of Formula 2 , a 6th at the 1983 International Trophy on board a March - BMW 832 his best result . Only when F3000 was introduced Lamberto 's interest was rekindled and , as is proven above , he became one of the category 's staunchest supporters . Reader 's Why by Don Capps It looks like Mario Andretti is trying to pass someone . The car is carrying the number 22 and wearing Tissot sponsorship . So that narrows it to the Ensign . And looking at the background , it says , \" Long Beach ! \" That means this must be Andretti coming up to pass Lamberto Leoni during practice for the 1978 race . Leoni is one of those shooting stars that flashes through the firmament and is soon over the horizon . A good , competent F3 driver , Leoni moved into F2 and was never quite there in the placings at the end of the race that one would expect . He did manage to win an F2 race , the 1977 Misano race , driving a Chevron -Ferrari . His win was at the expense of Eddie Cheever who spent most of the weekend overcoming some sort of adversity - although he did win the first heat after an amazing race from deep on the grid . However , Leoni won the second heat and beat Cheever on the aggregate . Leoni immediately parlayed this into an F1 drive , getting enough lire to hire a Surtees at the Italian GP . He then did a deal that saw him in the Ensign for 1978 . Although he did make the grid for the Argentine race , he retired when the engine let go .

( AP ) -- Steve Slaton 's sophomore season started the same way he ended last year -- with a big performance . Slaton ran for 203 yards and scored two touchdowns to lead No. 5 West Virginia past Marshall 42 - 10 on Saturday . Slaton , the nation 's top freshman in 2005 with 19 rushing TDs , had his second straight 200 - yard game . He set a Sugar Bowl record with a career - high 204 yards in a win over Georgia in January . Slaton was the backbone of the nation 's fourth - best rushing attack last season and he tore up Marshall ( 0 - 1 ) in just the second meeting between the state 's two Division I - A schools since 1923 . \" The line and I had a good game plan coming in and we just executed , \" Slaton said . \" I have been here a year and now know better what the coaches want . I make reads better and I recognize defensive schemes and what they are trying to do to stop me . \" During preseason practices , coach Rich Rodriguez protected Slaton , who wore a special white jersey with red numerals that limited contact on him . Rodriguez let him loose Saturday . Slaton 's 33 carries were one shy of a career high . \" I think I can sustain that for 12 games , \" Slaton said . \" I feel good . \" Rodriguez did n't realize that Slaton had 21 first-half carries until he heard an announcement over the stadium 's public-address system . \" That 's an awful lot of pounding on a guy , \" Rodriguez said . \" We 've got to be conscious of that . \" West Virginia ( 1 - 0 ) , which is 6 - 0 all - time against Marshall , scored on four of its first five possessions and totaled 312 rushing yards . \" I 'm very surprised that they could run the ball on the defense like they did , \" Marshall coach Mark Snyder said . \" I do n't see any positives with this game because there 's a lot of work to do . We need to work on everything . \" Slaton surpassed 100 yards early in the second quarter and had 140 by halftime . He had a 14 - yard TD run around right end midway through the first quarter and scored untouched from 16 yards out after making a hard cut to the right late in the half for a 28 - 7 lead . Slaton also had a 10 - yard TD run negated by a holding penalty in the second quarter . West Virginia , whose ranking was its highest to start a season , opened its normally quiet passing game a bit , too . Pat White completed 10 - of - 14 passes for 168 yards . He found Brandon Myles with first - half TD tosses of 8 and 18 yards as West Virginia built a 21 - 0 lead . It was the first career multiple TD game for Myles , a senior . \" He 's seeing the field very well , \" Rodriguez said . \" Pat 's got a great feel for the game . He 's always had that . And as he continues to grow , I think he 's going to get even more explosive in the passing game . \" Marshall , limited to just seven first downs in the first half , went to its passing game late in the second quarter for its only touchdown . Freshman tight end Cody Slate caught passes of 26 and 14 yards to give Marshall its best field position at the WVU 25 . Matt Morris then made up for a dropped pass in the end zone earlier in the game by grabbing a 21 - yard TD toss from Bernie Morris . The pass initially was ruled incomplete but Marshall challenged and the play was overturned for a touchdown . Morris and Slate helped make up for the loss of two other receivers . Hiram Moore was suspended for the game after a drunken driving arrest last month and 6 - foot - 6 Shawn Lauzon was lost for the season with a hip injury in preseason practice . \" You have to play with who you have , \" Snyder said . \" It does n't matter who you are missing . \" West Virginia fullback Owen Schmitt scored on a 3 - yard run midway through the third quarter to cap a 66 - yard drive that was set up by an interception by freshman Quinton Andrews . WVU backup quarterback Jarrett Brown closed the scoring on a 7 - yard TD run with 1:13 left in the game . Marshall is 1 - 7 against ranked opponents since returning to Division I - A in 1997 . \" We 've got to be more ready for the mental part of the game , \" Slate said . \" You ca n't start off slow on a team like West Virginia . \" College Football News Sugar Bowl moved to Dec. 31 to avoid conflict with NFL game The Sugar Bowl has been moved off its usual primetime spot to noon EST Dec. 31 to avoid a conflict with a Monday night NFL game .

In between world tours with Ultravox and appearances on Live Aid , multi-instrumentalist Midge Ure has somehow found time to write and record an excellent solo album entitled The Gift . We spoke to him at home in his studio where he explained how the album was put together . \" I originally talked about doing a solo album three years ago when I released my first solo single ( a version of the Walker Brothers ' hit No Regrets ) , but I never found the time . It was n't until November ' 84 that I began planning this album and then the Band Aid Christmas single took priority , so I shelved the idea . What had initially started out as a two to three month project eventually turned into a six month one because of my involvement with Band Aid - and that is much longer than I like to take over recording any album . \" The songwriting itself was staggered over a similar period since Midge had no reserve of reject Ultravox songs to fall back on . \" What most solo albums are usually comprised of , \" he explained \" are rejected songs from previous band albums . Ultravox only write the right amount of material for each album we 're working on and we tend to scrap things as we go along ; we do n't ever finish a track and then say it 's not good enough to make the album . \" And that for Midge , meant writing a whole new collection of songs for the project . With The Gift , Midge Ure manages to produce an altogether more convincing music than we 've come to expect from Ultravox of late . Listening to the album , it 's easy to recognise specific elements of the Ultravox group ' sound ' , in particular the famed tiers of synthesized string parts , but as Midge says , \" it 's very difficult to separate the two . What I hear on my solo album as being Ultravox - ish is me ! I ca n't change that fact . That 's how I sound . \" Judged simply as a statement of what he is personally capable of creating outside of the inevitable musical confines of a successful band structure , The Gift is certainly a fine achievement . Stylistically , the album covers a wide range of material from out - and - out instrumental music - the oriental flavoured ' Edo ' ( surely destined to accompany innumerable future TV documentaries on the Far East ) ; to an excellent cover version of a rock classic - Jethro Tull 's ' Living In The Past ' ; then to the powerful , yet sad , social commentary of ' Waste Lands ' . Mixed with these are several instantly memorable tracks ( ' She Cries ' is one ) that would undoubtedly make potential hit singles ( were they released ) , so I asked Midge who was responsible for the choice of the less than obvious first single release ' If I Was ' . \" I chose it \" came the reply . \" I just think it 's a good pop song . I do n't discriminate between pop or rock music , I just believe that a good song should always be well - crafted and , to my mind , that 's true of ' If I Was ' . There 's some better stuff on the album sure , but as an initial single it 's quite a good track . People do n't expect to hear me singing an out - and - out pop song I 'm sure and I felt it was a suitable thing to immediately establish the solo album as different from Ultravox . It was either that or releasing one of the instrumental tracks ... \" With the single nestling in the No.4 slot of the UK charts at the time of writing , it seems the British public firmly agree with his decision . Midge 's appreciation of a well - crafted song is the main reason for including on the album a cover version of ' Living In The Past ' - a Jethro Tull tune that first caught his attention at the ripe old age of fifteen . \" It was around the time when I was forming my first bands back in Scotland , and that song really stood out for me . Probably because it was one of the first ever songs by a bonafide rock band to successfully cross over to the singles market and become a hit . And it has stuck in my mind ever since . \" Midge 's version of the song departs radically from the original recording except for his vocal rendition which emulates the dry , up - front production style so characteristic of Tull 's original . The result , for me , is one of the best Ure vocal performances yet captured on record and , in an age when even the best vocalists are rarely heard without their voice first being processed through expensive ADT and reverb devices , to expose himself like that was a brave move indeed . It only goes to show how surprisingly good a vocalist he actually is . \" I went for a very intimate vocal sound on that track in particular \" he said . \" To achieve it , I had to sing quietly , close - up to the studio microphone which I do n't normally do . I usually stand well back and belt it out , especially when I 'm going for the high notes like on ' Vienna ' . \" The overall arrangement of the song is quite different to Jethro Tull's . The bass part , for example , is newly composed and played by Level 42's Mark King who really has helped add sparkle to the track . How , I asked , did Mark 's involvement in the project come about ? \" I happened to bump into him last year when Ultravox and Level 42 were appearing on the same TV show and whilst having a few drinks at the bar , I asked him whether he 'd kindly play on my solo album if I ever got around to doing something in the future . He accepted , I mainly think because he really enjoys playing different types of music , though people only know him for his slapping funk bass style . He actually played the bass on ' If I Was ' , which is probably the simplest bass line in the world - and you would n't expect Mark King to play anything like that - but it 's very effective on the record . \" A solo record is usually a chance for established recording artists to show their expertise ( or lack of it ) on instruments with which they are not generally associated . Fortunately , Midge was wise enough to recognise his own musical limitations and , instead , enlisted the help of those more able to translate his ideas of how a particular bass or drum part should sound , into a musical reality . A decision that has produced an altogether more enjoyable and certainly less indulgent collection of music . So , apart from Mark King and himself , which other musicians contributed to the recording ? \" They were mainly bass players and drummers . People like Mark Brzezicki of Big Country , who 'd impressed me on a recent Steve Harley session I did ; Nigel Ross -Scott , who plays bass with Reflex , and Lindsay Elliott , who used to drum for Cockney Rebel and who I 've known for some time . \" \" I handled the keyboards , guitars and vocals myself but I did make a conscious effort to get away from the sequenced bass lines that Ultravox are so well known for . I thought the best way of doing that was through the influence of other musicians . A solo album , for me , should always be a solo effort and that 's certainly true of The Gift because every idea on it originated in some way from me . But I see no point , for example , in bringing in a musician of Mark King 's calibre and forcing him to stick rigidly to the notes you 've already composed ! That would be a dreadful waste of his talent . \" \" With the drummers , for example , I already had guideline drums programmed into a Drumtraks purely to give the players an indication of where the build - ups and fills would occur in each song . But they were then totally free to expand on that guide , which they did , and the end result was always more interesting having the benefit of the human touch . \" \" Every song used a pre-recorded click - track to drive sequencers but I did n't want to use only machinery because you can tell it 's just a machine . It would have been too easy to use programmed drums . Half the challenge of making the album was working with the other people . And that was the most exciting part as well . \" The Gift features three instrumental tracks : ' Edo ' , ' Chieftains ' and ' Antibes ' - which was recorded on the Caribbean island of Montserrat using a Casio CZ- 101 ! Hardly what you 'd expect from a musician whose public profile is so closely allied to the role of frontman / vocalist . What comes as even more of a shock to the system is Midge 's revelation that his initial intention was to produce an album that contained five songs and five instrumentals ! Somewhere along the line , however , matters were diluted somewhat but he decided to retain three of the instrumentals , even though he was well aware that \" more often than not , when you get a couple of instrumentals on an album , it means the guy 's run out of ideas ! \" . The reason for their inclusion ? Simple : \" I like instrumental music . I find it very easy to listen to and it allows you to use your imagination in a way that most pop music does n't . It 's refreshing . \" Part of the power and appeal of instrumental music undoubtedly lies in its ability to conjure up images in the mind . Yet it functions superbly too as a reinforcement to the visual image . This is never more prevalent than in the hypnotic television advertising and jingle markets where a good music track is recognised as being a vital element of a successful commercial . \" MIDI I find baffling ... I really do . \" Prime examples of this approach have been the stylish Levi jean commercials that exploded across our television and cinema screens a few years back . Anyone remember the first ' Rivets ' advert featuring an Ultravox - style synthesized soundtrack and filmed explosions in a sun-drenched quarry ? Well , the man responsible for the music was Midge Ure , though that first foray into the advertising business was n't a particularly enjoyable one as he explained . \" I do n't know if I 'd ever do it again . Working with advertising agencies is the pits ... just awful ! You 're usually dealing with half a dozen people who all agree with each other , none of whom have a clue what they 're talking about , musically . Nevertheless , I rattled off the music quickly and was really pleased with it . I think it went very well with the visuals because I was given the finished visuals to write the music to , which is a rare occurrence , so I 'm told . Normally , you 're only given a written outline of what the finished visuals may be like and have to create something to complement them . \" Creatively -speaking , Midge Ure never appears to be stuck for an idea , whether it be for a song or one of the many Ultravox promotional videos he has produced . But what , I asked him , shapes a song 's development ? \" Well , there are a million ways to come up with song ideas . They may be sparked off by a particular riff or chord sequence or simply a mood . But once I 've got a basic idea or a feel for a song , then that starts to dictate how the lyrics are going to follow . I might , for example , have a seed of an idea in the back of my mind but no clue how to go about recording it . So , I begin crafting the music in the studio , working layer by layer until eventually , the lyrics start to form where the verses and chorus will appear . It all becomes apparent as you 're doing it usually - a bit like painting by numbers . \" As the lucky owner of a fully - equipped studio in his back garden , I wondered whether the Ure songwriting method was helped at all by the nature of multi track recording ? \" Very much so . Using my own 24 - track studio as a writing tool is great . I still use a Yamaha keyboard with a built - in drum machine , which I keep at home in my kitchen , purely for coming up with basic song ideas , but nothing ever takes shape until I actually start working in the studio . \" \" I begin by putting down a SMPTE timecode on one track , and recording a very basic snare and bass drum part on tape as a guide . Then with everything I put down after that , I 'm always looking to get a high quality sound on tape as it will potentially be something I keep . \" \" I tend to do a lot of track bouncing - even though there are 24 tracks available - to build up a sound . I may record four or five instruments all playing the same phrase but in various octaves , then do a stereo bounce of the lot , simply to get closer to what I hear in my head . I used to do that a lot on string machine parts with Ultravox but on The Gift I used mainly sampled string sounds from the Emulator 2 . Working that way , you force yourself to make decisions halfway through the recording process of how things will sound in the mix and bounce tracks when required . It 's very good training having your own studio . \" Good training it can be , but it can easily create a whole new set of problems for the musician if not careful . \" Initially , when my studio was built , like everybody else , I thought I 'd do everything in it myself . But you get too involved . Everybody I 've talked to who has a home studio tried at the start to do it all themselves but ended up getting too involved in the technical side of things . Then their playing side goes all to pot ! That 's why I have an engineer come in and help me when I wish to do some real recording . \" Concentrating on the musical aspects of the recording seems to have paid dividends for Midge and listening to the album ( recorded in his Chiswick studio and mixed at Air Studios in Montserrat ) , there 's nothing amiss in the audio quality department either . Taking , as an example , the oriental - sounding instrumental track ' Edo ' from his album , Midge set about explaining just how it was pieced together in the studio . \" It started off as two romantic melodies - the very ' breathy ' sounding one and the one played on a koto in the middle section . At the end of the song the two melodies cross over perfectly and I was very pleased with that effect . But it did n't start to sound Japanese until I started to use a koto on it ( laughs ) ! Although I love the koto sounds you get on a Yamaha DX7 , for instance , I wanted to use a real koto , so you 'd hear the fingers scraping across the strings . If you listen to ' Edo ' on headphones , the track really opens up when the koto comes in because of the ambient way it was miked up . Once it started to sound Japanese , I just followed through the imagery and used Japanese flutes and various instruments which I sampled from a collection of compact discs I had of Japanese tunes . \" Sampled sounds are used tastefully and to great effect on many tracks from The Gift . So what did Midge think of the technique ? \" I find sampling great fun but it 's got a jokey image through people over-using the classic ' Orch 4 ' Fairlight preset which we 've all heard a million times before . I like the idea of sampling odd items like pots and pans to form rhythm tracks . In fact , we recorded my metal garage door being banged and sampled that on the Emulator 2 , then wrote a pattern into the drum machine and used that to trigger the Emulator . It produced this odd Burundi-like rhythm which I used as the basis of another instrumental on the album called ' Chieftain ' . I also sampled the anvil sound on ' The Gift ' using a Powertran MCS - 1 as my Emulator 2 was away having its software updated . \" Something else Midge found himself doing whilst recording the album , was sampling the guitar . \" I 'd record a guitar solo played through a Rockman and break it down into one - or two - note pieces , mainly string bending noises or really fast vibratos . Then I 'd sample those bits I wanted and play them back at half speed from the Emulator keyboard , totally out of context . Then I 'd start constructing the solo again but by playing it from the keyboard , in stereo , using those samples . \" If you 're intrigued to hear this technique in action , take a listen to the guitar solo on the track called ' When The Wind Blows ' from The Gift . It 's quite an arresting sound . As a recording artist , one benefit of owning your own studio is undoubtedly the freedom it brings you to experiment with equipment . And one criticism levelled at people , like Midge Ure , who utilise the latest technological instruments on their albums , is that they often lack imagination when it comes to using such devices to anywhere near their full creative potential . The studio , Midge reckons , certainly helps him overcome that problem : \" It took me over a year to get into the PPG , for example . I really started to hate the thing and it was so complex to use , as ordinarily , you never have the time in someone else 's studio to learn how to use it . But having one around my studio and having time to actually use one , everything just suddenly clicked into place and I began enjoying it and appreciating the sounds it made . \" \" The DX7 , on the other hand , I still think is impossible to programme ! I ca n't be bothered with it . It 's capable of producing some great sounds I admit , but Casio have now come up with some synthesizer that 's just as good I feel - and a lot easier to work . I 'm a great advocate of user-friendly instruments you know ! \" Continuing on the theme of instrumentation , Midge had this strong viewpoint to express : \" Just because there 's a wealth of keyboards , drum machines and samplers on the market does n't automatically mean your guitarist sitting in his bedsit has got to go out , sell his guitar and buy the stuff . He does n't have to use it . It 's there if he wants to use it . \" \" It 's like MIDI . He does n't have to get sucked into it or feel he has to understand it if he does n't want to . MIDI , I find baffling ... I really do . \" ( Well there 's honesty for you ! ) \" It 's too in - depth for me . If it had been around when I bought my first synthesizer then I would have grown up with it . But to start to understand all the aspects and parameters of MIDI now is beyond me . My head is full of musical notes and arrangements , and I should n't have to be worrying whether or not there 's a ten millisecond delay on such and such a MIDI channel . \" Midge Ure may not like being drawn into the technical side of MIDI but , like everyone who relies so heavily on the application of hi-tech instruments in their music , he must come to terms with it . Just as he has had to learn about timecodes and click - tracks in order to run his studio . \" Using drum machine and sequencer codes is an absolute nightmare at times but I find myself unable to avoid getting caught up in that side of things . Even so , it 's still less baffling to me than MIDI ! \" \" Timecodes are a fundamental necessity for synchronisation purposes . Without them , you run in to all kinds of problems . For example , one of the album tracks we recorded without laying down a timecode first , so we could n't sync up the Emulator 's sequencer to play a sampled cello part that I wanted to put on the track . And I could n't physically play the cello part using the Emulator 2 because I 'm not a good enough keyboard player . So we ended up scrapping the whole track and starting again . \" Whatever the problems encountered during the making of the album , The Gift conclusively proves that Midge Ure is a fine songwriter who is not afraid to use whatever tools he has available to realise his ideas . And that is something he can be proud of .

GCHQ first became aware in late 2015 of suspicious \u201c interactions \u201d between figures connected to Trump and known or suspected Russian agents , a source close to UK intelligence said . This intelligence was passed to the US as part of a routine exchange of information , they added . Over the next six months , until summer 2016 , a number of western agencies shared further information on contacts between Trump 's inner circle and Russians , sources said . The European countries that passed on electronic intelligence \u2013 known as sigint \u2013 included Germany , Estonia and Poland . Australia , a member of the \u201c Five Eyes \u201d spying alliance that also includes the US , UK , Canada and New Zealand , also relayed material , one source said . Another source suggested the Dutch and the French spy agency , the General Directorate for External Security or DGSE , were contributors . It is understood that GCHQ was at no point carrying out a targeted operation against Trump or his team or proactively seeking information . The alleged conversations were picked up by chance as part of routine surveillance of Russian intelligence assets . Over several months , different agencies targeting the same people began to see a pattern of connections that were flagged to intelligence officials in the US . The issue of GCHQ 's role in the FBI 's ongoing investigation into possible cooperation between the Trump campaign and Moscow is highly sensitive . In March Trump tweeted that Barack Obama had illegally \u201c wiretapped \u201d him in Trump Tower . The White House press secretary , Sean Spicer , claimed the \u201c British spying agency \u201d GCHQ had carried out the bugging . Spicer cited an unsubstantiated report on Fox News . Fox later distanced itself from the report . The claims prompted an extremely unusual rebuke from GCHQ , which generally refrains from commenting on all intelligence matters . The agency described the allegations first made by a former judge turned media commentator , Andrew Napolitano , as \u201c nonsense \u201d . \u201c They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored , \u201d a spokesperson for GCHQ said . Instead both US and UK intelligence sources acknowledge that GCHQ played an early , prominent role in kickstarting the FBI 's Trump - Russia investigation , which began in late July 2016 . One source called the British eavesdropping agency the \u201c principal whistleblower \u201d . The Guardian has been told the FBI and the CIA were slow to appreciate the extensive nature of contacts between Trump 's team and Moscow ahead of the US election . This was in part due to US law that prohibits US agencies from examining the private communications of American citizens without warrants . \u201c They are trained not to do this , \u201d the source stressed . \u201c It looks like the [ US ] agencies were asleep , \u201d the source added . \u201c They [ the European agencies ] were saying : ' There are contacts going on between people close to Mr Trump and people we believe are Russian intelligence agents . You should be wary of this . ' \u201c The message was : ' Watch out . There 's something not right here . ' \u201d According to one account , GCHQ 's then head , Robert Hannigan , passed material in summer 2016 to the CIA chief , John Brennan . The matter was deemed so sensitive it was handled at \u201c director level \u201d . After an initially slow start , Brennan used GCHQ information and intelligence from other partners to launch a major inter-agency investigation . In late August and September Brennan gave a series of classified briefings to the Gang of Eight , the top-ranking Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate . He told them the agency had evidence the Kremlin might be trying to help Trump to win the presidency , the New York Times reported . One person familiar with the matter said Brennan did not reveal sources but made reference to the fact that America 's intelligence allies had provided information . Trump subsequently learned of GCHQ 's role , the person said . The person described US intelligence as being \u201c very late to the game \u201d . The FBI 's director , James Comey , altered his position after the election and Trump 's victory , becoming \u201c more affirmative \u201d and with a \u201c higher level of concern \u201d . Comey 's apparent shift may have followed a mid-October decision by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( Fisa ) court to approve a secret surveillance order . The order gave permission for the Department of Justice to investigate two banks suspected of being part of the Kremlin 's undercover influence operation . According to the BBC , the justice department 's request came after a tipoff from an intelligence agency in one of the Baltic states . This is believed to be Estonia . The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the same order covered Carter Page , one of Trump 's associates . It allowed the FBI and the justice department to monitor Page 's communications . Page , a former foreign policy aide , was suspected of being an agent of influence working for Russia , the paper said , citing US officials . The application covered contacts Page allegedly had in 2013 with a Russian foreign intelligence agent , and other undisclosed meetings with Russian operatives , the Post said . Page denies wrongdoing and complained of \u201c unjustified , politically motivated government surveillance \u201d . Late last year Comey threw more FBI resources into what became a far-reaching counter - intelligence investigation . In March he confirmed before the House intelligence committee that the agency was examining possible cooperation between Moscow and members of the Trump campaign to sway the US election . Comey and the NSA director , Admiral Michael Rogers , said there was no basis for the president 's claim that he was a victim of Obama \u201c wiretapping \u201d . Trump had likened the unproved allegation to \u201c McCarthyism \u201d . Britain 's MI6 spy agency played a part in intelligence sharing with the US , one source said . MI6 declined to comment . Its former chief Sir Richard Dearlove described Trump 's wiretapping claim on Thursday as \u201c simply deeply embarrassing for Trump and the administration \u201d . \u201c The only possible explanation is that Trump started tweeting without understanding how the NSA - GCHQ relationship actually works , \u201d Dearlove told Prospect magazine . A GCHQ spokesperson said : \u201c It is longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters \u201d . It is unclear which individuals were picked up by British surveillance . In a report last month the New York Times , citing three US intelligence officials , said warning signs had been building throughout last summer but were far from clear . As WikiLeaks published emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee , US agencies began picking up conversations in which Russians were discussing contacts with Trump associates , the paper said . European allies were supplying information about people close to Trump meeting with Russians in Britain , the Netherlands and in other countries , the Times said . There are now multiple investigations going on in Washington into Trump campaign officials and Russia . They include the FBI - led counter - espionage investigation and probes by both the House and Senate intelligence committees . Adam Schiff , the senior Democrat on the House committee , has expressed an interest in hearing from Christopher Steele , the former MI6 officer whose dossier accuses the president of long - term cooperation with Vladimir Putin 's Moscow . Trump and Putin have both dismissed the dossier as fake . One source suggested the official investigation was making progress . \u201c They now have specific concrete and corroborative evidence of collusion , \u201d the source said . \u201c This is between people in the Trump campaign and agents of [ Russian ] influence relating to the use of hacked material . \u201d"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

The surprise move of the 10 - part series was announced as part of the BBC One autumn schedule launch . Band of Brothers , about the D-Day landings , was co-produced by US cable channel HBO and is the most expensive programme ever bought by the BBC at \u00a3 7 m . But BBC schedulers said they considered the series better suited to BBC Two . \" It was decided to move it to BBC Two because we would be able to give it an uninterrupted 10 - week run on the channel , which may not have been possible on BBC One , \" said a spokesman . The spokesman denied that Band of Brothers had been moved because it was not mainstream enough . Dramatic As the corporation 's flagship TV channel , BBC One seemed the natural place for a series as high profile as Band of Brothers . Spielberg 's involvement was a natural headline grabber . Tom Hanks was also involved as producer . The two previously collaborated successfully on blockbuster World War II movie Saving Private Ryan . The cost of making the series - \u00a3 87 m - made Band of Brothers newsworthy . It is said to be one of the most expensive TV programmes made to date . On 6 June - the 57th anniversary of the 1944 landings by allied forces - the first programme in the series was shown in a 1,000 seater auditorium beside Normandy 's Utah Beach . Band of Brothers is based on a true story adapted from the best-selling book by Stephen Ambrose . It traces the dramatic exploits of a US army unit as it fights its way across Europe . Spielberg filmed much of it in the UK , recreating elaborate sets from across Europe and the US . But although boasting a cast of 50 speaking parts and 1000 extras , most of the actors are virtual unknowns . In the US , HBO is noticeably excited about the start of the series on its network on 9 September . A large area of its website has been dedicated to it for some weeks . HBO organised the beach screening for the series .

In 1968 at the height of the movement against him , young protesters in Karachi and Lahore began describing him as a dog ( Ayub Khan Kutta ! ) . This was a time when politicians and rulers in Pakistan hardly ever used any derogatory language against their opponents , so Ayub was supposedly shocked when he heard that some of his ' children ' ( the term he used to describe his subjects ) , had called him a dog . Ayub had come to power in 1958 on the back of a popular military coup ( Pakistan 's first ) , and had enjoyed a significant run of admiration from a majority of Pakistanis in the first four years of his dictatorship . Vowing to make Pakistan a powerful and influential military - industrial state , Ayub encouraged and facilitated an unprecedented growth in the process of industrialisation in the country . He also initiated the introduction of technical innovations in agriculture and brought Pakistan closer to the United States , thus benefitting from the military and financial aid that came with the enhanced relationship . By 1961 the Ayub regime had largely restored the country 's economy that had begun to weaken from the mid-1950s onwards , mainly due to the political chaos that prevailed in the country , as various factions of Pakistan 's first ruling party , the Muslim League , indulged in constant infighting and intrigues , and were unable to address the growing disenchantment and cynicism exhibited towards politicians by those who were kept out from the political process dominated by the country 's political - bureaucratic elite . Ayub was at the height of his power and popularity when he decided to lift Martial Law in 1962 and restore at least a semblance of political activity by the parties that had been banned in 1958 . He became the president and handpicked an assembly through a complex electoral system that he called ' Basic Democracy ' . After discarding the 1956 Constitution , his assembly passed a brand new constitution that enshrined Ayub 's idea of ' Jinnah 's Pakistan ' . It revolved around the construction of a strong military - industrial state , propped - up by state - backed capitalism , free enterprise , agricultural reforms and a ' progressive interpretation of Islam that was compatible with science , technology and modernity . ' Ayub detested politicians , from both the left as well as the right . His regime came down hard on left - wing parties and then went on to also ban parties such as the Jamat - i-Islami ( JI ) \u2014 though the ban was overturned by the courts . Leftists accused him of encouraging crony capitalism , the exploitation of workers and the suppression of the rights and ethnic-nationalism of the Bengalis ( in East Pakistan ) , Sindhis , the Baloch and the Pakhtun , and of dislodging the Urdu-speaking ( the Mohajirs ) from important state and government institutions that they had helped build after Pakistan 's creation in 1947 . | Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in a crowd of his supporters | The religious right denounced him of being overtly secular and undermining ' Pakistan 's Islamic culture and traditions ' . Ayub easily glided through the many periodical protests that took place against him after 1962 and then won a second term as president in a controversial presidential race in 1965 . Buoyed by his victory and his status as a ' benevolent dictator ' , Ayub then made an uncharacteristic mistake by allowing himself to be convinced by the hawks in his cabinet ( led by his young foreign minister , Zulfikar Ali Bhutto ) , to crown his economic and political achievements with a military triumph against India . India had suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Chinese army in 1964 and Bhutto and his supporters in the cabinet were convinced that the Pakistan army would be able to crush the weakened Indian armed forces . Though the Pakistani armed forces made rapid gains in the initial period of the 1965 war , the conflict soon turned into a stalemate . Ayub settled for a ceasefire , apparently sending Bhutto into a rage . Ayub eased out Bhutto from the government but the damage was done . The war had drained the country 's resources and the economy began to slide . Ayub 's opponents accused him of ' losing the war on the negotiation table ' . Bhutto went on to form the PPP , and along with the already established left-wing groups , such as the National Awami Party ( NAP ) and the National Students Federation ( NSF ) , he became the most prominent face of left - wing opposition in West Pakistan . In East Pakistan , Shiekh Mujeebur Rehman 's Awami League ( AL ) , upped the ante against the regime and accused it of leaving East Pakistan open to an Indian attack during the 1965 war . As the Bengali nationalist movement led by AL and by various militant / Maoist Bengali nationalist groups in East Pakistan gathered pace , in West Pakistan , Ayub was suddenly faced by a spontaneous students ' movement when in October 1968 , a large contingent from the NSF gate - crashed a ceremony being held by the government at Lahore 's Fortress Stadium ( to celebrate the government 's ' Decade of Progress ' ) . The students began to chant anti-Ayub slogans and clashed with the police . They accused the regime of enriching a handful of cronies and letting everyone else suffer unemployment and economic hardship . Then in November 1968 , police opened fire on a left - wing student rally in Rawalpindi , killing three protesters . In response , students formed a Students Action Committee and announced that students across Pakistan would begin a concentrated protest movement against the regime . As the students began their campaign ( with most of the student groups demanding a socialist system and parliamentary democracy ) , Bhutto 's PPP joined the fray along with NAP and their entry brought with it the participation in the movement of the radical trade and labour unions that were associated with these parties . By late 1968 the movement had spread beyond Karachi , Lahore , Rawalpindi and Peshawar and reached the smaller cities and towns of Punjab and Sindh . Meanwhile in East Pakistan , AL and other Bengali nationalist groups began to demand complete provincial autonomy for East Pakistan . Schools , colleges and universities stopped functioning ; workers went on strike and closed down a number of factories , and white - collar professionals refused to attend office , further crippling an already deteriorating political and economic order . After failing to quell the protests ( through police action and wide - scale arrests ) , Ayub invited opposition parties to hold a dialogue with the government . But the PPP and NAP boycotted the negotiations that were largely attended by religious parties and some moderate right - wing parties . However , Mujeeb 's AL did participate , but the talks ultimately broke down . By early 1969 the movement had also been joined by peasant committees and organisations in the country 's rural areas . In March 1969 a group of senior military men advised Ayub to step down , fearing the eruption of a full - scale civil war in East Pakistan and political and social anarchy in the country 's west wing . A weakened and tired Ayub finally decided to throw - in the towel and resigned , handing over power to General Yahya Khan who immediately imposed the country 's second martial law . He promised to hold the country 's first general election based on adult franchise and to relinquish power after introducing parliamentary democracy in Pakistan . With this announcement , the movement came to a halt . Elections were held in 1970 . In East Pakistan the AL won 98 per cent of the allotted national and provincial assembly seats , whereas in West Pakistan , the PPP swept the polls in the region 's two largest provinces , Punjab and Sindh . NAP performed well in the former NWFP and Balochistan . Most of the ' status quo parties ' ( such as the many Muslim League factions ) and most religious outfits ( except Jamiat Ulema Islam ) were decimated . However , a three - way deadlock between AL , PPP and the Yahya regime ( over a power - sharing formula ) regime triggered a crisis that finally saw the feared eruption of a civil war in East Pakistan and then India 's entry into the conflict . After that disastrous conflict , a group of military officers ( most of them Bhutto sympathisers ) , forced Yahya to resign and then invited Bhutto and his party to form the country 's first parliamentary government . Ayub , who had gone into seclusion , died in 1974 . Published in Dawn , Sunday Magazine , August 31 , 2014"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Officers are seeking legal advice to see if the gang 's assets can be frozen under the Organised and Serious Crimes Ordinance , which enables the proceeds of organised crime to be confiscated . Cheung has been detained in Guangzhou with 17 Hong Kong residents and 14 mainlanders in connection with a string of crimes including the kidnapping of two SAR tycoons whose families paid a total of more than $ 1 .6 billion ransom in 1996 and 1997 . ADVERTISEMENT Cheung has allegedly pocketed $ 738 million of the ransom money , but is said to have lost $ 300 million gambling in the United States and Macau . While the amount of assets that Cheung 's gang owns in Hong Kong remains unclear , police are awaiting advice from legal advisers about whether money sent overseas can be seized . Cheung is believed to own a number of properties in Hong Kong , including a 3,000 - square - foot Ho Man Tin home . His gang was also said to have laundered some of the money on the mainland by buying more than 50 properties and 11 vehicles , the proceeds of which have been seized by Guangdong police . Another $ 40 million in cash has been found there . Mr Hui said police here would consider whether evidence against convicted gunman Yip Kai-foon collected by mainland authorities could be used in prosecutions against Yip . While the tycoons have widely been reported to be Walter Kwok Ping-sheung and Victor Li Tzar-kuoi , the families who paid the ransoms did not report the kidnappings to the police . Mr Hui disagreed this represented a vote of no confidence in the force . \" I do n't think that there is a question of a lack of confidence . Whether one decides to make a report to the police is a personal matter , \" he said . \" If you look at the overall crime situation in Hong Kong , the past two years have been stable and if you look at the statistics last year , they are the lowest in 25 years . \" Trademark and Copyright Notice : Copyright 2005 , The Standard Newspaper Publishing Ltd. , and its related entities .

The exhibition is based on research by Andrejs Edvins Feldmanis ( born in 1939 ) , a Latvian cinematographer and board member of the Occupation Museum Foundation . Feldmanis dedicated the exhibition to his father , First Lieutenant Fridrichs Feldmanis of the Latvian Army , who was murdered by U.S.S.R. NKVD units at an army summer training camp in Litene , Latvia , on June 14 , 1941 . Excerpts from the exhibition 's brochure allude to the dangerous political backdrop of Europe in the late 1930s , which portended a bleak future for Latvia . \" The government of Latvia had to pay special attention to its eastern border , because under Stalin the U.S.S.R. actively pursued the idea of ' exporting the Revolution , ' [ with the aim of dominating the world ] in the name of protecting the proletariat . Soviet Special Forces exerted considerable pressure on Latvia 's eastern border in the form of intelligence activities ( with a training center for spies located in the Russian frontier city Ostrov ) , and the activities of members of the outlawed Latvian Communist Party , smugglers , saboteurs , and the like . \" Between the two world wars Latvia 's eastern border was in many ways a dividing line between the East and West in Europe . [ \u2026 ] Contrasting political systems and ideologies [ sparked various countries ' intelligence activities in Latvia ] . Local people and border guards were actively recruited and became involved in these activities . Some local Russian families [ \u2026 ] were pro-communist and supported the Soviet secret service . [ \u2026 ] Some local inhabitants and border guards were double agents \u2026 \" On the night of June 15 the [ Latvian ] border is being guarded by Janis Macitis on patrol and Peteris Cimoska in the blind . Karlis Beizaks and Valdis Grinvalds are in the duty room . The wife of patrol leader Fricis Purins , Hermine , and his son Voldemars are in his apartment . In a house rented by Zanis Krievins , his wife Lida -Julija , his son Arturs , and his daughter Rita , and the children 's guest , 6 - year - old Erika Kalnina , are asleep . \" At around 2:30 a.m. 25 NKVD [ Interior People 's Commissariat ] men cross the Ludza River and surround the Maslenki border guards ' [ patrol ] house and the Krievins ' house . The attackers place hand grenade packets around the guardhouse . Possibly , the initial plan is to capture the patrol , but the attackers are spotted by Macitis . As an exchange of gunfire ensues , the tactics of the NKVD unit turn to destroying the patrol . Macitis is seriously wounded and retreats towards the guardhouse . Cimoska returns the attackers ' automatic rifle fire and , retreating towards the guardhouse , steps on a grenade packet and is torn to shreds in the explosion . \" Grinvalds returns the fire through the guardhouse window , while Beizaks tries to run for help to the 1st Patrol . After running 199 meters , he is gunned down . \" The attackers throw a firebomb into the guardhouse , first setting the interior on fire and then the entire house . Hermine Purina tries to save herself by jumping through the window but is shot 8.5 meters from the guardhouse . Her son Voldemars runs out the door and seeks refuge in a nearby woodpile . He is shot by the attackers in the leg and stomach and dies from his wounds the following day at the hospital in Rezekne . Macitis , too , has been mortally wounded . He is found dear close to the house , with his legs burned . Grinvalds runs unhurt from the burning house and throws himself into the river , where he is captured . \" As the guardhouse is attacked , the NKVD men also storm the Krievins ' house , tossing in hand grenades . These seriously wound Krievins ' wife and she loses consciousness . Krievins and his son sustain lighter wounds and are captured by the attackers . The girls escape by hiding under a bed . \" The NKVD posts an advance guard 250 meters from the Maslenki cordon to prevent possible aid to the Maslenki patrol . Here the leader of the 1st Patrol , Vilis Lazdins , and guards Arvids Polis and Jezups Abrickis are captured as they hasten to the tragic event . \" When the attackers have overcome the guard , they capture some other survivors , including the family of farmer Dmitrijs Maslovs , who lives nearby . Rounding up their own wounded and their casualties , they hastily gather some of the evidence and retreat beyond the border , into Soviet territory . \" \u2026 After the October 5 , 1939 treaty [ which provided for the establishment of ] Soviet army bases on Latvian territory , the Latvian Army [ was ] forced to design a new mobilization and defense plan . This plan [ had ] a single objective : to resist the U.S.S.R. armed forces should they attempt to take over all of Latvia . According to [ Latvian ] historian Edgars Andersons , mobilization was to take place in three days ' time , and two defense lines were to be established in the east . The Daugava , Aiviekste , and Pededze rivers were to form the defense line . \" As is well known , neither the Latvian Border Guard nor the Latvian Army received orders to resist the occupation forces . The government of Latvia and its army [ were ] forced to accept the situation in Europe , when none of the Western powers [ were ] willing or able to help the Baltic States [ defend themselves against the Soviet invasion ] . \" The Soviet invasion of Latvia on June 17 , 1940 , following its ultimatum , interrupted the official investigation of the attack on the Maslenki border post . There had been attacks on other posts . Only after Latvia regained independence in 1991 was the case reopened . The case concluded that Soviet military persons had killed three Latvian border guards - Karlis Beizaks , 25 , Janis Macitis , 27 , and Peteris Cimoska , 26 , and two civilians , Hermine Purins , 44 , and Voldemars Purins , 14 . Three members of the Purins family were wounded . Ten Latvian border guards and 27 civilians in all had been captured . Several small children and one infant were among the captives . Less than a month later , on July 7 , 1940 , all the captives except Dmitrijs Maslovs were returned . Maslovs was later tried by an NKVD court , sentenced to death , and shot in 1942 . Seven-year- old Silvija Smukkalne suffered a nervous breakdown ; she contracted a disease of the nervous system after her release and died ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

The Equal Justice in the Courts task force , led by former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson , was a four-month project commissioned by Chief Judge Janet DiFiore in June , amid nationwide demonstrations against institutional racism touched off by the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor . Their report specifically calls on court leaders to establish a \u201c zero tolerance \u201d policy against racism and discrimination , implement comprehensive bias training programs and increase the hiring of people of color and other underrepresented populations throughout the court system . The report 's authors also advised court leaders to assign an independent monitor to evaluate and report on the court system 's handling of the recommendations . Chief Judge Janet DiFiore has appointed Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David to that role . Johnson and his team of attorneys and advisers interviewed hundreds of judges , attorneys , court staffers , observers , litigants and other court stakeholders and accepted testimony and reports from people involved in the legal - justice system . \u201c In my assessment as a lawyer , a student of history , a former public official , and as an African American , this is a moment that demands a strong and pronounced rededication to equal justice under law by the New York State court system , \u201d said Johnson , a partner at Paul , Weiss , Rifkind , Wharton & Garrison , LLP . DiFiore said she and the Office of Court Administration endorse the recommendations , which \u201c offer a tangible framework for a court system that truly reflects the diversity and inclusiveness of our communities , ensures the fair administration of justice and promotes the public trust . \u201d Nearly three decades after the last review on court system bias , judges , attorneys , court personnel and other stakeholders continue to report implicit and explicit racism , the report found . \u201c The good news is that today 's New York State judiciary is more diverse than it was 30 years ago , \u201d the authors state . \u201c The bad news is that the accounts of explicit and implicit racial bias we heard as part of this review were strikingly similar to the testimony from decades ago . \u201d The report found that people of color are underrepresented on county and municipal benches across the state , including in every borough of New York City . In Queens , for example , over 60 percent of the judiciary is white , compared to less than a quarter of the population , the report found . Latino and Asian populations are the most underrepresented on the bench in Queens . While the judiciary has become more diverse statewide , the gap between the percentage of non- white residents and non- white judges has actually increased since 1991 , according to the report . In 1991 , people of color made up 30.7 percent of the state population and just 8.2 percent of the bench \u2014 a 20.5 percent gap . In 2020 , people of color made up 44.8 percent of the state population and 23.9 percent of the bench \u2014 a 20.9 percent gap . The most explicit accounts of racism pertain to the conduct of court officers , based on interviews with various attorneys , personnel and litigants . Multiple people described court officers using racial slurs , including the n-word , in courthouses . One court officer sergeant called a group of Black teenagers the n-word in an elevator , according to a public defender interviewed by the commission . Court officers of color told interviewers that they did not feel comfortable coming forward to report the abuse for fear of being ostracized and that officers faced few consequences for their behavior . \u201c Although interviewees stressed that not all court officers behave in a hostile manner , almost every interview touched on what appears to be a culture of toxicity and unprofessionalism exhibited by court officers towards litigants , litigants ' relatives and attorneys of color , \u201d the report states . Observers have long noted the demographic disparities and institutional racism in the court system . The report has galvanized many groups , including bar associations and organizations representing judges , to share their concerns \u2014 often backed up by demographic data and personal testimonies . In August , for example , an organization representing more than 200 New York judges of color released a report on institutional racism in the state court system that they had submitted to the Commission on Equal Justice in the Courts . The report by the Judicial Friends Association highlighted racial and ethnic disparities in judicial leadership , detailed impediments to equal justice for Black and Latino defendants and made recommendations for addressing pervasive biases . \u201c To assess the extent to which racism affects the New York State Unified Court System , one must start at the top and ask , \u201c are Black judges participating in the most powerful , policy making positions within OCA ? \u201d The answer is a resounding NO , \u201d the Judicial Friends wrote . None of the executive judges in the Office of Court Administration are Black , the association wrote . Just three Black judges hold statewide positions and the disparities continue down the judicial ranks , including the presence of just six Black judges on the 81 - member Court of Claims appointed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo , they added . The Judicial Friends cited OCA statistics showing that roughly 76 percent of New York 's 1,291 state judges are white , about 14 percent of judges are Black , 7 percent are Latino and 2.7 percent are Asian . Their report described disparities at all levels of the criminal justice system , such as a jury selection process that allows attorneys to strike potential jurors based on their negative interactions with police officers or their support for the Black Lives Matter movement . Judicial Friends President Erika Edwards , Manhattan Supreme Court Justice , told the Eagle that the commission enabled judges and other stakeholders to speak out on the key matter of representation and bias . \u201c The difficulty as judges is we are precluded from speaking on political matters , \u201d Edwards said last month . \u201c It 's difficult , being a judge of color , dealing with COVID , dealing with shootings of unarmed men and women of color because there 's not much we can do . \u201d \u201c But this was something we could do to help improve our system and the world , \u201d she continued . The demographic disparities have also galvanized activism among Queens ' bar association and legal groups . Attorneys and judicial leaders have called for more Black , Latino , Asian , South Asian and Muslim judges on the bench to truly reflect the diversity of the borough . \u201c The courts where people of color are the predominant users , it 's so critical that there be a diverse bench , \u201d Supreme Court , Criminal Term Administrative Judge Joseph Zayas said earlier this month . \u201c It 's not disputable . People need to see themselves reflected on the bench . \u201d"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

The 64-year- old had been questioned previously during a three - and - a- half year probe by detectives from the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation attached to the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement ( ODCE ) into alleged financial irregularities at the failed bank . The bankrupt former businessman , with an address at Camaderry , Whitshed Road , Greystones , Co Wicklow , stepped down in December 2008 . Anglo was subsequently nationalised and re-branded the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation ( IBRC ) with its collapse costing Irish taxpayers about \u20ac 30 bn . The dapper former banker had been arrested at Dublin Airport in the early hours of today by arrangement \u2013 and indicated that he understood why \u2013 before he was taken to the Bridewell Garda Station in the city -centre . There , at 8.08 AM , he made \u201c no comment \u201d when he was charged with 16 counts contrary to Section 60 of the Companies Act . The charges allege that before it was nationalised , he permitted the bank to \u201c give unlawful financial assistance \u201d to 16 named individuals for the purpose of or in connection with a purchase by the same people of shares in the then Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Plc . It is claimed the alleged unlawful financial help to buy shares was given between July 10 and July 17 , 2008 to 15 people \u2013 which include the so-called \u201c Maple Ten \u201d group of Irish Investors and several members of Sean Quinn 's family \u2013 and from July 17 until July 30 , of the same year , to Patricia Quinn , the wife of now bankrupt quarry tycoon Sean . Among the names on the charges is Sean Quinn Junior , who was jailed last week by the High Court for contempt of court for hiding \u20ac 500 m of property assets from Anglo , now called the IBRC . Also included in the names of people who allegedly got financial assistance to buy shares in the bank are : Colette Marie Quinn , Aoife Quinn , Ciara Quinn , Brenda Quinn , property developer Patrick McKillen , Seamus Ross , Brian O'Farrell , John McCabe , Gerard Maguire , Patrick Kearney , Gerard Gannon , Gerard Conlon , Sean Reilly and Joseph O'Reilly . State solicitor Jane Farrell told Judge Cormac Dunne at Dublin District Court that the DPP has directed that Mr Fitzpatrick is to face trial on indictment in relation to all the charges . His charges are duplicates of those brought earlier this week against two other former senior executives from the bank , Willie McAteer and Patrick Whelan \u2013 and like them he will face a trial before a judge and jury at Dublin Circuit Court . Looking tanned and dressed in a dark blazer , blue shirt , pink tie and beige trousers , the ex-banker remained seated and silent with his hands on his lap as he looked at the judge who was taking down notes detailing his arrest . He spoke once saying \u201c thank you \u201d after the judge agreed to release him on bail pending the preparation of the book of evidence . His sister Joyce O'Connor stood bail in the sum of \u20ac 10,000 . Once the independent surety was approved , he was let out and ordered to appear again on October 8 next . Mr Fitzpatrick walked from court with a garda escort straight into a media scrum and was surrounded by photographers and camera crews . He was then ushered into a waiting taxi which whisked him away from the courthouse . It had been a busy morning for the ex- Anglo chairman ; he had been arrested at 5.37 am by arrangement at Dublin Airport and from there he was taken to the Bridewell Garda Station . After being charged there , he emerged from the back of the station at 9.12 am with his head looking downwards and a dark coat draped over both his hands . He was the last of three prisoners loaded on a Garda van ; seconds later it pulled out and brought him on the short drive to the Criminal Courts of Justice Complex at Parkgate Street for his hearing . At 11.11 am , at Dublin District Court , the 17th case was called . Sean Fitzpatrick walked in a doorway from the holding cells into courtroom number one where the public gallery was jam - packed with lawyers , gardai , about 20 journalists and dozens of legally aided unemployed defendants \u2013 some who faced drugs , shoplifting , assault and public order charges . Detective Sergeant Brian Mahon of the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation , who has been seconded to the ODCE , told Judge Dunne that the former banker replied \u201c I do \u201d when he was asked if her understood why he had been arrested . He was later charged with the 16 offences at 8.08 am . \u201c I cautioned him , after each charge his reply was ' no comment ' , \u201d said Det - Sgt Mahon . Defence solicitor Michael Staines put it to Det - Sgt Mahon that : \u201c Once he became aware gardai were seeking to arrest him , he contacted you through his solicitor and arranged to meet you at the airport . \u201d The fraud squad detective agreed that was the case and that throughout Mr Fitzpatrick 's travels abroad he has let gardai know where he was at all times . There was no objection to bail but the officer said that he wanted a \u20ac 10,000 independent surety to be set . Granting bail , Judge Dunne ordered Mr Fitzpatrick to sign on every Wednesday at Irishtown Garda station in Dublin , reside at his current address and give gardai 48 hours notice if he intends to change address or leave the country . The judge stipulated that the signing - on condition would be suspended during periods when Mr Fitzpatrick is out of the jurisdiction .

Dragon Quest III , a.k.a. Dragon Warrior III The earlier Dragon Quest games usually had a section where players were left to their own ends . This one had the most substantial example . Developed by Enix Designed by Yuuji Horii Platform : Famicom , NES Length : Very long Of Note : Until this game , and unlike the series inspiration Wizardry , the Dragon Quest games gave the player pre-made characters ( DQII ) , or at least those with randomized stats ( DQ ) . This was the first game to use a Wizardry - like system of letting the player actually create his teammates in a simple creation process , giving them names and classes and even letting him swap them in and out of his party at will . The result was a game with greater longevity than many Japanese console RPGs . Players can play with a party with the basic Soldier , Pilgrim and Wizard , or experiment with other unusual configurations like three Merchants or Jesters . The Game : Up until Dragon Quest III , the venerable series did have some non-linear aspects . Most of the original game is not really blocked in any way other than by being infested with monsters that can instantly kill an unprepared player . The second and third games have a substantial portion of them taken up in a search for important items scattered throughout their worlds . One interesting thing that separates these Dragon Quest games from many others is the role bridges play in them . Bridges tend to signify a major change in the difficulty of monsters the player encounters . If the player is still struggling with the monsters he 's fighting and sees a bridge , he 'll know not to traipse across it . There are exceptions to this rule , and sometimes monsters improve upon crossing invisible boundaries , but the use of some element of the scenery to indicate to the player that difficulty is going up is an idea that far more RPGs could stand to borrow . While most games use \" hard \" barriers to prevent player access to later areas , Dragon Quest is more likely to use \" soft \" barriers , where the player can go where he wants , maybe after an early section that 's more linear , but it might be unwise to do so because of the strength of the monsters . In an action game player skill can make up for undue numeric difficulty , but in a turn - based combat RPG the numbers and flags that define a monster 's abilities are the challenge , and there 's only so much the player can do to get around them . If you think about it , this poses unique problems when designing a non-linear RPG . To a player with 40 maximum hit points , going from an area where the monsters do 12 hit points of damage to an area where they do 20 is an almost unbearable increase in danger . If the quest path is mostly straight and one - way , then the monster spawn zones can be placed to match . But if the game is n't linear , then the designer has no idea where the player will be going next . The player might stray into areas intended for far hardier characters than he 's had the chance to build , and could get wiped out quickly , causing frustration . I think some frustration is n't necessarily bad in a game , but no one wants to challenge the gods unprepared . But on the other hand , if all the areas have monsters that are a good challenge for characters from the moment they are able to enter them , then growth will be rapid at first and soon the player will cruse through the rest of the game . The Dragon Quest games , to my eyes , solve the problem by taking advantage of an interesting aspect of RPG character growth , the fact that the effective rate of character growth actually decelerates over time . Take 1st and 2nd edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons level growth as an example . Back in those days , a character 's starting hit points were determined by the role of a single die . Upon reaching each additional level , players got to roll another die and add that to their total . The result was , at first level the player 's hit points could be as low as one , but with each additional level gained the law of averages caused HP to trend towards average , making them more generally survivable against foes of equal level . However , the amount of hit points gained with each level remains constant , even though the player is accumulating more and more of them . A first level mage in 2nd Edition AD&D had an average of 2.5 hit points . Gaining an additional level approximately doubles that figure . But a tenth level mage has about 25 hit points , and gaining level 11 still adds on just 2.5 more . The gain relative to what he already has becomes less and less as the character grows . More recent versions of D&D even out the randomness a bit more by giving characters maximum hit points at first level , and JRPGs like Dragon Quest work around this by giving characters some extra HP at the start , by subtly increasing growth rate at higher levels , and sometimes by even starting players at higher levels , but the overall principle still applies . As the player 's party gains levels , they may grow linearly , or even in a steadily accelerating rate , but the effective benefit from those levels decreases . Dragon Quest games never start the player , from first level , in a wholly non-linear part of the game ; that bit only kicks in once he 's gotten some levels under his belt . The result is , that large area with monsters all of about the same level , if made just a little harder than usual , can suffice to provide good challenge for quite some time . A level 21 player may struggle a bit when facing level 26 monsters , but he wo n't be wiped out as a level 1 player would be fighting level 6 foes . Design Lessons : The non-linear sections of the early Dragon Quest games ( IV does not apply ! ) allow the player some freedom in his exploration , but have to be carefully handled to continue to give the player a sense of danger . But it is n't all that bad if the player 's party gets a little strong compared to the opposition during the tail end of these sections . If an RPG couples monster difficulty too closely to PC advancement , then the player never gets the feeling that his wards are really improving . The worst games in this regard are those that multiply by scaling values to directly tie monster difficulty to player level . Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy VIII are two notable games that do this . Oblivion does it too . If monsters are always slightly stronger than the player , then what on Alefgard / Ivalice / Tamriel are experience levels for ? Links : Wikipedia GameFAQs 14 . Ufouria , a.k.a. Hebereke It 's like Metroid meets Hello Kitty , true , but it 's actually rather a cool little game . Developed by Sunsoft . Directed by \" Chow - Mu-Sow \" and Yoshinori Homma Designed by \" Ucchi \" Platform : Famicom , NES ( European , Australian ) Length : Short Of Note : This is a rather quirky open world game that , despite being the subject of an infamous Nintendo Power spread , never made it to the United States . The reasons are possibly related to Sunsoft 's continued disappointment over Blaster Master . It 's actually fairly rare in any territory , and is regarded as a collector 's item . By the way , if you decide to hunt this game up and play it , you should probably be made aware of the primary means of attack . Early in the game , before weapon items have been found , the only way to harm enemies is to jump on them with the down direction held on the control pad . If you jump on them Mario style you 'll just get hurt , but holding down causes the characters to present their feet in order to give the monster a good stomp . Once killed , the enemy usually leaves behind a weird blue face that can be used as a weapon against other monsters . The Game : The game 's map is found early , but is more like the one from Goonies II than Super Metroid , showing the general location of the areas and sometimes it shows the location of objects , but not exits or any detail , and other things only if special detectors are found . This is another game that starts the player out with only very basic maneuvers and makes him find 90 % of the abilities he can eventually have . In this case , some of those abilities come in the form of alternate characters he can control . Unlike Legacy of the Wizard ( see below ) , the player can switch between these guys at any time , which is kind of a weird decision from a design standpoint . Only one character walk on ice and float on water , yet another can sink in water , one can climb walls ( once the appropriate item is found ) , one can destroy bombable walls ( again , with the right item ) ... and another has floaty jumps that let him cover long distances . There is really no good reason all of these abilities ca n't be given to one character , especially since they otherwise have similar abilities and share the same damage meter . But on the other hand , a lot of the game 's charm comes from its animations , and there 'd be a lot less of that to see if the player only had one guy to play . As far as game structure , there are some rather fiendish secret routes in this one , like doors found on platforms surrounded on all sides by air , and which must be sort of lucked onto from above . There 's another place where the ghost character has to jump from cloud to cloud to make it to an important area , but there 's a gap between two clouds that looks too far to jump . It is too far , but if the player tries it , a cloud shoots up from below , just as the player passes it . While the game 's character graphics show an undeniable Sanrio influence , the backgrounds seem a lot more detailed than they have to be . Have a look at the water for example , those animated waves look a lot more realistic than they have any right being in a game like this . Design Lessons : One thing about Ufouria that could possibly be regarded as a negative in how it takes after Metroid is its health system . Both games start the player with a pitiful amount of health , far less than maximum , and when starting a new life they go back to that minimal energy level . In Ufouria the player can eventually get up to 250 health , but every time a life begins , he 's back to 10 . At least in Metroid enemies drop health rather frequently ! Maybe one in eight kills in Ufouria drop a health ball , and those are only worth 2 energy each ! The only realistic way to refill health is to find Medicine or Water of Life somewhere in the game , which refill 50 and all health respectively , but each can only be found once per life , and neither can the player carry more than one of either at a time . While I think we can all agree that this is going too far , there is something to be said for the spirit it adds to a game . It means that the player ca n't ever just bludgeon his way through any areas . Any time he 's going somewhere to fight a boss , even if he 's going through the areas at the very start of the game , he ca n't just rush through and take the hits . Whether the damage taken at any point leading up to a boss , or facing the boss himself , it counts the same . The player must pay attention if he 's going to survive , and classic gamers tend to appreciate that .

Correspondence Address : In 1896 , Joseph Babinski , a French neurologist , first described the best known neurologic eponym ' the Babinski sign ' . This sign is characterised by dorsiflexion of the big toe and recruitment of the extensor hallucis longus muscle , on stimulating the sole of the foot . He has emphasised from the outset , the intimate relationship between this sign and the shortening movement in other leg muscles , which form the flexion synergy of the lower limb . The Babinski sign is not a new reflex , rather it is released as a result of breakdown of the harmonious integration of the flexion and extension components of the normal defence reflex mechanism , due to pyramidal tract dysfunction . A pathological Babinski sign should be clearly distinguished from upgoing toes that may not always be a part of the flexion synergy . This article reviews the Babinski sign in detail , focusing on the historical perspectives , role of pyramidal tract dysfunction and art of elicitation and interpretation . The significance of assessing this phenomenon in the entire leg , and the clinical clues that will help to dispel the myths regarding the Babinski sign , have been emphasised . It was on February 22 , 1896 , that Joseph Francois Felix Babinski published his first report on ' reflexe cutane plantaire ' [ cutaneous plantar reflex ] which became the sign that bears his name : ' the Babinski sign ' . [ 1 ] However unknown to Babinski , several painters like Bortticelli , Raphael , Leonardo da Vinci had previously demonstrated this phenomenon in their paintings . [ 2 ] Later , Babinski asserted that if others had described the abnormal reflex before him , they found it fortuitously and did not realize its clinical implication ; while he discovered it by a combination of chance , careful observation and intuition . [ 3 ] Babinski first differentiated between a normal and pathologic plantar response . [ 4 ] Sketch of the Man Joseph Babinski was born in Paris and died at the age of 75 in 1932 [ Figure . 1 ] . Of reticent disposition , he wrote in a very sombre and serious tone , but his gaze , clear and calm , was penetrating and scrutinizing . [ 5 ] He was a devout bachelor and had two passions in his life i.e. work and his brother Henri . His objective was always to find clinical signs that permitted the authentification of the organic nature of the syndrome ; and specify the localisation of the lesion responsible for the same . Babinski 's ambition to establish a department of neurosurgery at the Hospital de la Pitie in Paris , where he did most of his work , was realised shortly after his death . [ 6 ] The Babinski sign This eponym refers to the dorsiflexion of the great toe with or without fanning of the other toes and withdrawal of the leg , on plantar stimulation in patients with pyramidal tract dysfunction . The characteristic response is dorsiflexion of the great toe by recruitment of extensor hallucis longus ( EHL ) muscle . In most mammals the limbs are automatically retracted on painful stimulation as a defence reflex , which is more pronounced in hind limbs . Sherrington called it , the flexion reflex synergy , because activation of all muscles effected shortening of the limb ; the toe extensors forming part of this shortening synergy . Confusion has arisen from the application of the term extensor plantar response to a movement which forms part of a flexion synergy of the lower limbs . The toe ' extensors ' although named extensors by anatomists , are infact flexors in a physiological sense because their action is to shorten the limb and contract reflexly along with other flexor muscles . The Babinski sign may be a normal occurrence in the 1st year of life , due to a brisker flexion synergy , the toes being a part of it . As the nervous system matures and the pyramidal tract gains more control over spinal motor neurons , the flexion synergy becomes less brisk and toe ' extensors ' are no longer a part of it . The toe then often goes down , instead of up , as a result of a segmental reflex involving the small foot muscles and the overlying skin . This is considered to be normal in adults and is termed - flexor plantar response . With lesions of the pyramidal system , structural or functional , this segmental downward response of the toes disappears , the flexion synergy may become disinhibited and the EHL muscle is again recruited into the flexion reflex of the leg producing the sign of ' Babinski ' . [ 7 ] The muscles taking part in a fully developed response include extensor hallucis longus , tibialis anterior , extensor digitorum longus , hamstring group of muscles and tensor faciae latae . The characteristic response is dorsiflexion ( extension ) of the [ big toe ] , which precedes all other movements . It is followed by fanning out and extension of the other toes , dorsiflexion of the ankle and flexion of the hip and knee joint . This response represents ' positive ' Babinski sign . There is no such thing as a ' negative ' Babinski sign . The role of pyramidal tract There seems to be a close association between occurrence of the Babinski sign and impairment of voluntary foot movement . A Babinski sign can appear only if the intraspinal pathways of the flexion reflex synergy are operative , however , severe the motor deficit in the foot . The function of the pyramidal tract may not only be disturbed by structural lesions of myelin sheaths , axons , or both , but also by nonneurological conditions [ Table I ] . The motor neurons of the leg muscles are laminated into separate columns within the anterior horn of the cord , each of which supply proximal or distal muscles , flexor or extensor muscles . In addition , there are important pyramidal tract projections to the intermediate ( interneuronal ) zone . This divergence of pyramidal tract projections allows the following two explanations for the Babinski sign . The Babinski sign might be released by dysfunction of pyramidal tract fibres that project on interneuronal zone , at least on those interneurons that subserve the flexion reflex synergy , of which the Babinski sign is a part . As these interneurons are necessarily interconnected across the segments of the lumbosacral spinal cord , a Babinski sign would always be Types of Babinski sign a) Minimal Babinski sign : Contraction of hamstring muscles and tensor faciae latae . b) True Babinski sign : Includes all the components of the fully developed extensor plantar reflex . c) Pseudo Babinski sign : One may encounter this type of response in sensitive individuals , plantar hyperaesthesia , and choreo-athetosis due to hyperkinesis . True Babinski can be clinically distinguished from the false Babinski by the contraction of hamstring muscles in the former , and failure to inhibit the extensor response by pressure over the base of the great toe . d) Exaggerated Babinski sign : It can either be in the form of ' flexor spasm ' or ' extensor spasm ' , depending upon the muscles i.e. whether flexors or extensors , have excess of tone . Flexor spasms occur in spinal cord disease , bilateral upper motor neuron lesion at a supraspinal level , multiple sclerosis and subacute combined degeneration of the cord , while ' extensor spasm ' occurs in patients with corticospinal tract lesion when the posterior column function is normal . e) Inversion of plantar reflex : If the short flexors of the toe are paralysed or flexor tendons are severed accidentally , an extensor response may be obtained . f) Tonic Babinski reflex : Characterised by slow prolonged contraction of extensors of toe , seen in frontal lobe lesions and extrapyramidal involvement . g) Crossed extensor response / bilateral Babinski sign : Unilateral stimulation produces bilateral Babinski in patients with bilateral cerebral disease and spinal cord disease . h) Spontaneous Babinski : In infants and children following manipulation of the foot , and in patients with extensive pyramidal tract diseases , passive extension of the knee or passive flexion of the hip and the knee , may produce a positive Babinski sign . The art of elicitation The reflexogenic area for the plantar reflex is the first sacral ( S1 ) dermatome with the receptor nerve endings being located in the skin . The afferent nerve is the tibial nerve , the spinal cord segments involved in the reflex arc being 4th and 5th lumbar and 1st and 2nd sacral . Position All the leg muscles should be visible and in a relaxed state . This can be achieved by positioning the patient in a way that the knee is slightly flexed and the thigh is externally rotated . The patient should be warned that the sole is going to be scratched and ask him to try to let his limb remain as floppy as possible . The toes should not be touched at all . Stimulation It is the site of stimulation , the intensity of stimulation , and even the object used for stimulation that has received by far the most attention . Any part of the leg can be stimulated , but the best technique is to stimulate the lateral plantar surface and the transverse arch in a single movement upto the middle metatarsophalangeal joint with a firm applicator lasting 5 to 6 seconds . [ 9 ] Difficulties are bound to arise in certain clinical situations which makes elicitation and interpretation of plantar response inconclusive . It is imperative that one realises these problems and be aware of their solutions in order to arrive at an appropriate clinical conclusion [ Table II ] . Alternate methods The late 19th and early 20th century was abound with disclaimers associated with founders of new reflex movements of the great toe . These movements are known by the term ' Babinski like responses ' . These responses can be elicited by the following techniques , each with its own eponym . By stroking the lateral malleolus ( Chaddock 's sign ) ; squeezing the calf muscle ( Gordon 's sign ) ; applying pressure along the shin of tibia ( Oppenheim sign ) ; pressing the 4th toe downwards and then releasing it with a snap ( Gonda 's sign ) ; vigorous adduction of the little toe followed by its sudden release ( Stransky sign ) ; squeezing the Achilles tendon ( Schaefer 's sign ) , flexion of the toes , on quick percussion of the tips of the patients toes with the finger tip ( Rossolimo 's sign ) ; flexion of the four outer toes induced by tapping the dorsum of the foot in the region of cuboid bone ( Mendal Bechtrew sign ) ; giving multiple pinpricks on dorsolateral surface of the foot ( Bing 's sign ) ; forceful passive plantar flexion of the ankle ( Moniz sign ) ; pressing over the dorsal aspect of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe ( Throckmortan sign ) ; application of forceful pressure over anterior tibial region ( Strumpell sign ) ; scratching the dorsum of the foot along the inner side of the extensor tendon of the great toe ( Cornell sign ) ; plantar flexion and fanning of the toes on tapping the mid plantar region of the foot or base of the heel . Interpretation Incorporation of videotape and electromyography should be welcomed in the interpretation of plantar response . [ 10 ] The following criteria that have emerged from the comparison of clinical data with electromyographic results may be applied for interpreting a pathological Babinski sign . [ 11 ] a) Upward movement of the great toe is pathological only if caused by contraction of the EHL muscle . b) Contraction of the EHL muscle is pathological only if it is occurring synchronously with reflex activity in other flexor muscles . c) A Babinski sign does not necessarily imply that the concurrent activity of the other flexor muscles should be very brisk and vice versa . d) The true Babinski sign is reproducible , unlike voluntary withdrawal of the toes . Fallacies An extensor response may be present when there is no damage to the pyramidal tract . A possible explanation being the excitation of the distal motor neurons and inhibition of the impulses via flexor reflex afferent nerve fibres can be dissociated because they are mediated by different neurons , however closely linked . On the contrary , cases with proven damage to the pyramidal system have had normal plantar response . We should understand that corticospinal fibres not only originate in different parts of the cortex , but also have different terminations . Babinski sign can be expected only when ' leg fibres ' of the pyramidal tract are involved . Plantar areflexia can be noted in cases with loss of sensation of sole due to lesion of the first sacral cutaneous distribution . The same can be observed in paralysis of extensors or long flexors of great toe . In spinal shock , cessation of tonic discharge of spinal neurons by excitatory impulses in descending pathways may explain its non existence . Drugs like parenteral physostigmine in physiological doses may also abolish a plantar response . Despite the continuing controversy and observer bias , clinical utility of Babinski sign remains unchallenged . The role of pyramidal system in the pathophysiology of this sign is quite clear . Pyramidal tract dysfunction releases the flexion reflex synergy , of which contraction of the extensor hallucis longus muscle forms an integral part . The most important and vital question in interpreting the plantar response is not , whether the great toe goes up or not , but is whether an upgoing toe is pathological or not .

Or it 's the soundtrack to an alien abduction , limp limbs trapped in the gravitational pull of something transcendent . Or it 's a headphone dirge for a swamp of lost souls . Whatever , I do n't know how to describe it . Yellow House is the kind of album that makes adjectives irrelevant but you helplessly stack them up anyway , in case one of them will stick . Here goes : gorgeous , pastoral , layered , ethereal , urgent , transportive , soulful , sweeping . It all started with a suddenly single Ed Droste a few years back . In the spirit of all great bedroom art , he was more interested in catharsis than a record deal , channeling his post-breakup pain through ProTools . Droste brought in Chris Bear for some late - hour assists and so Horn of Plenty was born . With the subsequent additions of Chris Taylor and Daniel Rossen to round out the sound , Grizzly Bear reemerged as a foursome and soon embarked on recording their follow - up . Their second album , Yellow House , has been floating around for months , slowly dismantling everyone it touched . Since it first appeared , bloggers have seemed near-illiterate trying to express how affecting it is . And so we retreat to the shelter of superlatives ( album of the year assertions not rare at all ) and back to the thesaurus , hoping maybe this time we 'll nail it . But how do you pin down a sound that 's simultaneously intimate and epic , traditional and experimental , down - to - earth and stratospheric ? How do you explain the sadness , hope , power , vulnerability , delicacy rooted in it like gold ore ? Eventually , if you 're wise , you just give up . You give in the music , which says it all and much more eloquently . Or better yet , you can get drummer and sometimes - vocalist Chris Bear to do the talking . So slip on your headphones , fall in love and check out my interview with Bear : NL : Clearly , Yellow House is very different from Horn of Plenty . What are the big changes in play ? CB : The biggest change is that we actually became a band . Chris T. , Daniel , and I basically came into Grizzly Bear after Horn of Plenty was already finished . I helped Ed tie up some loose ends with Horn of Plenty , but that record was pretty much all him . Getting together the band for the live show changed things quite a bit , in terms of dynamics and instrumentation used . The songs were quite simple and open ended so it left a lot of room for interpretation , which was great because it allowed us to get a band sound happening and working a very reactionary level . Then Yellow House changed even more because we were working with new songs and reacting in different ways . A lot of the songs are composed by Daniel and the way that he writes brings out another side of how the band interacts . In general , having four people with different ideas and strengths has changed our sound the most . NL : You seem to enjoy self - producing in houses versus the studio route . You even go so far as to celebrate that fact with your new album title . What 's the advantage of recording in a house and doing production yourselves ? CB : I think the biggest advantage is just flexibility ... being able to work at any time of the day and not be dependent on studio hours . A lot of the stuff we 'd end up recording was really late at night after voices had really warmed up or after properly loosening up at our religious cocktail hour . Also , self - producing makes it a little more comfortable to try things out and toy with different sounds for a long time . After the initial basic tracking month , a lot of things were added individually by everyone and a lot of those sounds were very time intensive . I could n't imagine doing some of those things with everyone around or feeling like you 're on the clock at a studio . NL : Why the remix CD for Horn of Plenty ? Can we expect something similar for Yellow House ? Are you planning on doing any more remixes for other artists ? CB : The remixes for HOP started because Kanine was going to rerelease the album with better distribution but need some sort of \" bonus \" to make it happen . It was kind of Ed 's pet project . He basically just emailed a lot of people and luckily most of them were down to do it . Everyone was very gracious for participating . I do n't think the same will happen for Yellow House ... at least to level that it did for HOP , not every song , but there are some in the works . Chris T. and I did a remix for Of Montreal , and that was really fun . I 'd be interested in doing some more . It is a fun way to think about music . NL : Did any of the Horn of Plenty remixes affect your sound either live or recorded ? CB : Hmm .... I do n't think we 've necessarily changed our songs as a result of any of the remixes . But Final Fantasy did some strings on Yellow House as a result of the relationship we developed through the remix project . NL : A lot of major blogs have really gotten behind the new album and you yourselves have a pretty great blog promoting music you like . How much effect do you think music blogs have on getting the word out ? CB : Blogs and the Internet in general are incredibly effective in terms of getting your music out there . It 's kind of scary how quickly some bands come out of nowhere and blow up , primarily from gathering buzz on the Internet . But I 'm very happy with the response and that people are excited about the music we make . NL : Yellow House has lately supplanted Kid A as my go -to album for night driving . What activities do you suggest pairing your music to ? CB : Oh wow ... Replacing Kid A is pretty epic -- that is a pretty great night drive album . I guess Yellow House works as a nighttime album . For some reason , I sort of associate it with chips , salsa and cocktails , late afternoon ... but that has very little to do with the music . That was just ritual during the first month we started the record . NL : Speaking of activities , I read about a laser light show you did in Seattle ? What was that like ? CB : Man ... that was totally amazing . Probably one of the coolest places we 've ever played . I just wish we could have watched the whole show ... but it was hard to look up at the ceiling the whole time . Everyone said the laser technician did a great job working with the music . NL : Horn of Plenty seemed very much like a breakup album , a heartbreak album . Does Yellow House have any similar overarching motivations ? CB : I do n't think so ... Personally , I feel like we were all just learning to play and interact with each other . NL : If Chris T. could cut anyone 's hair , who would he pick ? CB : He said Andy Warhol .... he 's always had pretty awesome hair . NL : What is your favorite trend or development in music as of late ? CB : Screwed and chopped shit . NL : I 've never seen you in concert before , but I 'll be there on Sept. 29th at The Independent . What can I expect from the Grizzly Bear live experience ? CB : Well , it is very different from the first album . Any songs we play from Horn of Plenty will sound totally different ... much more dynamic and fleshed out . A lot of the things from Yellow House are have changed in the live show too ... we just worked out a live version of \" Little Brother \" that is more stone groove / classic rock song . NL : Is there a tangible difference between American audiences and international ones ? Where would you most like to play that you have n't played yet ? CB : I think international audiences are more curious perhaps . People are more likely to come up , introduce themselves , and ask questions or just talk about what they thought of the music . Also , more people want autographs internationally which is funny to me . I 'd really love to play in Brazil and Australia some day . NL : Rave about three artists or albums from 2006 everyone should check out . CB : Dirty Projectors - I know he has been around for a while , but I discovered his music in 2006 . I liked what I had heard before , but then we played with him in Canada and I was sold . His live show was incredible . I love how ambitious his music is , yet at the same time it is totally palatable and poppy . His choice of instruments , arrangements , voice , melodies .... all totally incredible and inspirational . [ Ed. note -- Dirty Projectors are opening for Grizzly Bear at the Bowery Ballroom on September 26th . A good chance to catch them both . ] Wyrd Visions - I had never heard them until the first show of a Canadian tour we did with them and Final Fantasy . Colin [ Bergh ] has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard ... pure , delicate and unaffected . It 's kind of like Chet Baker if he made dark , nordic folky music . Danava - I think their music is finally going to be properly released by Kemado soon . These dudes from Portland are so serious . I 'm not really that much of a metalhead , but they are amazing . Kind of Black Sabbath / T. Rex but more acid metal like Hawkwind or something . I got to see them live and it was so great . One of the loudest shows i've ever seen , but I could n't bring myself to put earplugs in .

In a motion filed with the Supreme Court , the Center for International Law ( Centerlaw ) urged the Supreme Court to order the Office of the Solicitor General ( OSG ) , through Solicitor General Jose Calida , to provide them copies of documents related to the government 's crackdown on illegal drugs . CenterLaw filed a petition in 2017 with the high court seeking the issuance of a writ of amparo to protect the residents of 26 barangays in San Andres Bukid , Manila City against the government 's war on drugs . The Free Legal Assistance Group ( FLAG ) also filed a petition with the high court then asking the magistrates to declare as unconstitutional the Philippine National Police ' \u201c Oplan Double Barrel , \u201d which it said allows the police to \u201c neutralize \u201d suspected drug pushers instead of arresting and prosecuting them . A three - day oral argument was conducted and eventually , Calida was ordered to submit within 60 days the following : - Names , addresses , gender of those killed - Place , date and time of drug operations - Names of PNP team leader and team members who participated in the operation the pre-operation plan - Post operation report - Whether search warrants or warrants of arrests were issued - Names of representatives of media , NGOs and barangay officials present during the police operations For those listed under \u201c death under investigation , \u201d the high court asked the submission of the following : - Names , addresses , gender , ages of those killed - Date , time and place of the killing - Scene Of the Crime Operatives ( SOCO ) team leader and members who investigated the killing - Investigation reports - Charges have been filed against the suspects if there are any The high court also asked government lawyers to submit the records of all buy - bust operations conducted in San Andres Bukid , the subject of one of the two petitions , as well as the pre-operations and post-operations plans . Parties to the case according to the high court should be provided a copy as the details required do not compromise national security contrary to Calida 's arguments . The information and the documents also do not involve rebellion , invasion , terrorism , espionage , infringement of our sovereignty or sovereign rights by foreign powers , or any military , diplomatic or state secret . READ : SC orders go v't : Submit reports on drug war killings Calida filed an appeal but was rejected by the Supreme Court in April last year . The following month , the OSG submitted some of the required details and documents and sought two more months to fully comply . But in a September 2018 motion , Calida again demurred on the release of thousands of documents , saying that they contain \u201c very sensitive information with law enforcement and national security implications . \u201d He also said that the petitioners \u2014 CenterLaw and FLAG \u2014 are only entitled to documents related to the killings stated in their petitions , but not to other documents related to the other killings . Centerlaw , in its recent pleading , said the continued refusal of the OSG is in violation of the Rules of Court that requires pleadings and papers to be served on the parties affected . They added that denying them a copy of the documents is a violation of their right to due process as well as President Rodrigo Duterte 's Executive Order No. 2 , s. 2016 , that provides a legal presumption in favor of access to information , public records , and official record . They said a denial of their request will be a first in the history of the Court \u201c where evidence duly submitted to it and forming part of its determination of the pending case will be intentionally withheld from the opposing parties . \u201d / ee READ : SolGen wo n't give drug war records to SC Subscribe to our daily newsletter Subscribe to INQUIRER PLUS to get access to The Philippine Daily Inquirer & other 70 + titles , share up to 5 gadgets , listen to the news , download as early as 4 am & share articles on social media .

Syedna Dawood Bin Ajabshah ( R.A. ) 975-999 A.H. : Syedna was molested by Muzaffarshah in Ahmedabad . He looted mumenins and tyranissed them in every way . Due to his tyranny Syedna went to kapadwanj . Muzzafarshah was then defeated by Akbar . So he fled from Ahmedabad to Kapadwanj . There he was welcomed by syedna 's representatives Sh. Kazikhan and Khoj bin malak . Syedna did not think of avenging the cruelties of Muzzafarshah in latter 's plight . Later syedna invited Muzaffershah and his troops to his home and latter repented for his misdeeds . After appointing Mirjahan as his deputy Akbar returned to lahore . But mirjahan also molested mumenins for not consuming drugs ( Ganja and Bhang ) . He was also a tyrant and was instigated by Mohammed bin Taher Nehrwala . In Baroda also Akbar 's deputy Moh. khan troubled mumenins much . Salahuddin of baroda killed Syedi Moosanji Tajsaheb on backbitings of foes . They were trying to arrest Syedna . Thereafter Syedna came to Cambay ( Khambhat ) . There Syedna was presented Shawls by the deputy of Akbar , khan Azam . He instructed his representatives to respect Syedna . Syedna 's spirituality attracted every one including Kings and rich people of the city of Cambay . Syedna Dawood Bin Qutubshah ( RA ) 999-1021A. H. : Syedna Dawood bin Qutubshah ( RA ) also passed the difficult period with the rulers . In his time Shahmurad the prince of Akbar came to Ahmedabad as Governor . Representatives of Suleman went to him and bribed him . They claimed Rs. 16 lakhs of rupees from Syedna . This caused the arrest of learned and virtous persons Miya Shaikh Adam and Miya Ali Mohammed for forty days . At that time Sadiq Mohammed the vazir of the emperor helped Syedna in many ways . When Shah Murad came to know about about the reality , he ordered to give up charges of arrest . After some days Shah murad released the pious persons with all their due repsects . Suleman refused to accept Syedna as a Dai . However a big file of letters was revealed in which suleman had accepted Syedna as Dai . On the basis of this file the documents were prepared to support Syedna . These documents were signed by Vazir Sadiq Muhammed , Qazi jan Muhammed Sakaki , Amir Kabir , Shah Abu Turab and others . When turk of vazir came to know about the artocities of Suleman , he arrested suleman in the fort of zamamar and asked him to pay a bail of Rs.80,000 . Suleman did not pay and escaped to India . Syed Qasim again arrested Maula Ali Mohammed and Maula Shaikh Adam . When Begum of Shah Murad in Bharuch knew the matter she immediately ordered the release of Maula shaikh Ali Mohammed and Maula Shaikh Adam . She ordered the arrest of Suleman and Ibrahim . Suleman and Ibrahim reached lahore after their release and backbited Ahdi Kamal Khan , one of the darbaris of Akbar . This caused the arrest of six pious persons including Maula Ali Mohammed and Maula Shaikh Adam . After arresting them Kamal Khan came to Ahmedabad to arrest Syedna . He troubled the mumenins of Ahmedabad a lot . He looted the Mohallas of mumenins . In lahore six pious persons were under the tyranny of Osman , brother - in - law of Kamal Khan . When vazir fathulla khachki knew about the arrest , he immediately ordered to release them . After tyrannising in Ahmedabad kamal khan returned to Lahore with all looted property . Due to tyranny 27,000 mumenins of Ahmedabad scattered and resided in remote parts . When the emperor was informed of tyranny and loot , he ordered Aamir kabir raja ramdas to arrest him before entering lahore . He was then arrested and presented in Darbar . Saiyedi Shaikh Adam was also presented with him in the Darbar . After hearing the sufferings mumenins had from Kamalkhan the emperor ordered rigorous imprisonment for kamalkhan . In 1005 A.H. Syedna Dawood Bin Qutubshah , having been summoned by emperor Akbar to appear at the court , he besought maula shaikh Adam , Maula Ali Mohammed , Maula Mamuji and Maulana Khanji . through Hakim Ali. Maula Shaikh Adam replied that \" Though Syedna was in seclusion since four years but they should try their best to convey him the bounties of emperor \" . The emperor granted khilat to four pious persons and a shawl to Syedna . When Syedna reached Lahore , the emperor was in Kashmir . In emperor 's absence Hakim Ali received Syedna in Lahore and escorted him to the court of Kashmir in a state silver palanquin . The emperor received him with great respect . Syedna was given a high seat in the darbar . According to his habit Syedna recited Quran - Sharif daily in the darbar of emperor . The emperor was so influenced by the spirituality of Syedna that he would gaze at him for hours . Syedna stayed in kashmir as a respected guest of emperor . All nobles especially Abul Fazal , Hakim Ali and Khan Azam gave due respect to syedna . Syedna came to Lahore from Kashmir and thereafter he returned to Ahmedabad under the protection of the emperor with Royal Farman , ordering the officials at Ahmedabad to show him every attention and to receive him wherever he went with respect on account of his great learning , virtue and piety . The emperor granted the following farman in syedna 's honour . This farman is written by vazir Abdul Fazal in golden letters . Emperor Akbar 's farman : Allaho-akbar . This glorious farman is issued graciously to satisfy the wishes of sardar of Dawoodi Bohras after considering and calling him to our darbar so that the deputies of Gujarat especially authorities of Ahmedabad and Sidhpur and areas in connection to them , not obstruct them in their ways and let them come to us according to their will . And ( the auhorities ) should not object them and his followers especially in their religious traditions , systems and taxes and about prohibited things and they should return their properties which are sealed , afer removing the seals giving them back . Not to restrict them from any business or occupation they are willing . They should give facilities to them and authorities should not be covetous for any thing . They should return all the properties which are seized because in near future their case is to be taken under consideration . Karories , Jagirdars and all responsible Mutasaddirs of Gujarat are required to extend all facilities to the mentioned pious persons while passing through their territories . If he wants any guide then provide him with it for safety against robbery and all dangers of the way so that they may reach to their safe place . To respect them must be considered a duty . 1st Rabiul - Awwal 1005 A.D. Capitol Lahore . Along with this farman Syedna was presented with valuable khilas and a horse . The farman was renewed by Jahangir in 1099 A.H. After these events contacts with Hakim of Ahmedabad harmonised . But soon Shadman came to Ahmedabad as new Hakim . He was not good with Syedna . Thereafter Syedna left Ahmedabad . When Jahangir knew about it , he removed him and Shaikh farid came to Ahmedabad . Syedna already had good relations with Shaikh farid . Shaikh farid earnestly requested syedna to return to Ahmedabad . Thereafter Syedna returned to Ahmedabad and was respected by high authorities throughout rest of his life . Syedna Abdul Taiyab Zakiuddin ( R.A ) 1030 - 1041 A.H. : During the reign of Syedna Abdul Taiyed Zakiuddin , son of Syedna Dawood bin Qutubshah , Ali bin Ibrahim turned astray . He went to Jahangir 's darbar and complained that he was excommunicated by syedna and was very much molested by his enemies creating great disturbance in Ahmedabad and preferring several vexation complaints against him at the court of Jahangir . The ministers of the darbar opined that reconcillations should be brought between Syedna and his enemies ( Ali bin Ibrahim ) . Syedna was invited by the emperor to his court , where he stayed for some period and was treated with great honour andrespect . Ali bin Ibrahim begged pardon of syedna through emperor 's recommendation . Syedna pardoned Ali bin Ibrahim for his deeds . Syedna Qasim Khan Bin Feerkhan 1042-1054 A.H. : Syedna was grandson of Syedi Hasan peer shahid who had solved the difficulty of sultan peeram shah about an Aayat of Quran . During this period there were no disastorous events but the period was not completely quiet . The jealous groups were unsatisfied by the civilised approach of Akbar and Jahangir but they were compelled to obey the directions of these emperors . The explosion of these jealousy took place in the reign of Syedna Qutub khan Qutbuddin , son of Syedna Dawood bin Qutubshah to whom Akbar and Jahangir had granted glorious farmans . Syedna Qutbuddin Shahid 1054-1056 A.H. : During the reign of Syedna Qutbuddin Shahid Aurangzeb came to Ahmedabad . Abdul Gavi a staunch Sunni backbited Aurangzeb and caused the arrest of Syedna . Gavi argued that Syedna was Rafzi ( one who do not obey Rasulullah 's Sunnah ) and therefore his blood is legal . Though shahbeg the kutuwal was not tyrant but was bound to follow the orders of Gavi . He carried away six big carriages of books to see whether there was anything to prove Rafzi . He imprisoned Syedna Qutbuddin Shahid , his sucessor Syedna Fir Khan Shujauddin and two other mumenins . Syedna suffered a rigourous prison for about a month . He was then invited to Aurangzeb 's darbar for clarification . Syedna declared that they are the true followers of Rasullullah and his sunnah . All present darbaris were greatly impressed by Syedna 's speech . Abdul Gavi a staunch sunni was not ready to release a pious shia . He prepared a false mehdara blaming syedna as Rafzi . Qazi refused to attest the mehdara without witness . Abdul Gavi persuaded two innocent children from Syedna 's family and presented before Qazi as witness . Qazi signed the mehdara unwillingly . The document for Syedna 's execution was prepared . On the 27th of Jamadil - Ukhra in 1056 A.H. Syedna was slained by the tyrants . His corpse were not given to mumenin to bury . But by a miracle they were able to carry it under the sentry . After this martyrdom there was a open slaughter of mumenins on streets of Ahmedabad . Tyrant Auangzeb ordered to expell the momenins , the followers of Syedna from city . This was the second plight after the plight of tyranny of kamalkhan . A glorious mausoleum is erected over his tomb by Syedna Taher Saifuddin Saheb in Ahmedabad . Syedna Feer Khan Shujauddin 1056 - 1065 A.H. : He was kept in captivity by the bigoted prince Aurangzeb and was taken by him to Aurangabad after being removed by emperor shahjahan from Gujarat to the Deccan on account of his cruel oppression . Thereafter in Lahore Syedna was placed in stable , which on the following night happened to catch fire and was totally destroyed except the dungeon , where in Syedna passed the night and prayed to Almighty and was found quite safe in the morning . All people held that the conflagration was the consequence of the curse the prince had brought upon himself by keeping his holiness in captivity . By an imperial order Aurangzeb was compelled to set Syedna at liberty and grant him a safe and honourable return to Ahmedabad . He reached Ahmedabad after two years of Shahdat in themonth of Ramazan . Gheratkhan was then Hakim of Ahmedabad . Again Gherat Khan was backbited . He arrested Syedna and demanded Rs. 3 lakhs . Syedna was again imprisoned and was released after the 6 months . In 1066 A.H. Shahmurad came to Ahmedabad and arrested Syedna . Thus after Shahdat of Maulana Qutbuddin Shahid R.A. , Syedna Shujauddin suffered much for the sake of the divine mission of the khidmat of Imamuz -zaman . On one side Syedna was suffering and on the other Hakims were compelling mumenins to Shave their beards , to intoxicate and to use bangles and ornaments made of ivory . One may remind the circumstances during and after shahdat of Imam Hussain ( S.A. ) in Karbala after Rasulullah ( S.A. ) Syedna Abdul Taiyeb Zakiuddin ( R.A. ) 1085 - 1110 A.H. : On request of Mumenins Syedna arrived in Ahmedabad . He was again persecuted by the deputies of Aurangzeb acting in collusion with his enemies . Kar Talib khan , who was then Hakim tried to arrest Syedna coveting wealth . But Syedna secretly went away to Jamnagar . In Jamnagar Jam Tamanjee gave refugee to Syedna accepting the imprisonment of his two sons laka and bhaba . During the same period Maulana Najam Khan , Maulana Abdul Vahid , Maulana Hassan Khan , Maulana Tayeb Khan and many other pious persons were led in captivity to the court of Aurangzeb at Aurangabad . They were released after undergoing severe hardships ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Astronomers have known for years that Mars possessed polar ice caps , but early attempts at chemical analysis suggested only that the northern cap could be composed of water ice , and the southern cap was thought to be carbon dioxide ice . Recent space missions then suggested that the southern ice cap , existing all year round , could be a mixture of water and carbon dioxide . But only with Mars Express have scientists been able to confirm directly for the first time that water ice is present at the south pole too . Mars Express made observations with its OMEGA instrument to measure the amounts of sunlight and heat reflected from the Martian polar region . When planetary scientists analysed the data , it clearly showed that , as well as carbon dioxide ice , water ice was present too . The results showed that hundreds of square kilometres of ' permafrost ' surround the south pole . Permafrost is water ice , mixed into the soil of Mars , and frozen to the hardness of solid rock by the low Martian temperatures . This is the reason why water ice has been hidden from detection until now - because the soil with which it is mixed cannot reflect light easily and so it appears dark . However , OMEGA looked at the surface with infrared eyes and , being sensitive to heat , clearly picked up the signature of water ice . The discovery hints that perhaps there are much larger quantities of water ice all over Mars than previously thought . Using this data , planetary scientists now know that the south polar region of Mars can be split into three separate parts . Part one is the bright polar cap itself , a mixture of 85 % highly reflective carbon dioxide ice and 15 % water ice . The second part comprises steep slopes known as ' scarps ' , made almost entirely of water ice , that fall away from the polar cap to the surrounding plains . The third part was unexpected and encompasses the vast permafrost fields that stretch for tens of kilometres away from the scarps . The OMEGA observations were made between 18 January and 11 February this year , when it was late summer for the Martian southern hemisphere and temperatures would be at their highest . Even so , that is probably only \u2013 130 degrees Celsius and the ice that Mars Express has observed is a permanent feature of this location . During the winter months , scientists expect that carbon dioxide from the atmosphere will freeze onto the poles , making them much larger and covering some of the water ice from view . Mars Express and OMEGA will now continue looking for water ice and minerals across the surface of the planet . In May , another Mars Express instrument , the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding ( MARSIS ) , will begin collecting data , looking for water underground . It will be particularly exciting when MARSIS looks at the south pole because , once planetary scientists know how deep the ice reaches , they will be able to calculate exactly how much water there is . Knowing this is very important to understand how Mars evolved and if it ever harboured life ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Nine black teenagers ranging in age from 13 - 19 were arrested . \" The deputy sheriff realised two of the white hobos were in fact women , \" historian Dan Carter told the BBC in October . \" The young women worried they might be accused of prostitution , so they accused the black boys of having raped them . \" I think anyone today who studied the evidence would conclude no rapes occurred . \" ' Great day for freedom ' Charles Weems , Andy Wright and Haywood Patterson were pardoned on Thursday by the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles ( ABPP ) . Convictions against Olen Montgomery , Ozie Powell , Willie Roberson , Eugene Williams and Roy Wright were overturned and charges dropped in 1937 . Clarence Norris received a pardon from Alabama Governor George Wallace in 1976 . Norris , the last surviving Scottsboro Boy , died in 1989 . Civil rights groups ' efforts to fight their convictions and to win new trials sparked civil rights protests and led to two landmark US Supreme Court rulings . The US high court overturned convictions for some of them in 1932 on the grounds that the teenagers were denied competent legal counsel , and again in 1935 because African Americans were not allowed to serve as jurors during the trials . The Alabama state legislature passed a law earlier this year allowing the parole board to grant the Scottsboro Boys posthumous pardons . \" Today , we were able to undo a black eye that has been held over Alabama for many years , \" ABPP assistant executive director Eddie Cook said following the board 's unanimous decision . The men 's struggles later inspired books , films and a Broadway musical , as well as the Scottsboro Boys Museum and Cultural Center . \" It is a great day for freedom , \" the museum 's executive director Shelia Washington said ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Men with names such as Blackbeard , Calico Jack , and Black Bart pillaged and plundered ships and seaport towns , offering violent retribution to those who resisted and seizing fortunes at will . Viewers get to know the real characters , fight the battles they fought , watch nations rise up to stop them , and separate fact from fiction in the world premiere TRUE CARIBBEAN PIRATES on Sunday , July 9th , 2006 at 8 pm /7 c on The History Channel . After Christopher Columbus landed in the West Indies in 1492 , Spain and its powerful navy established a dominating presence in the region . Vast riches in gold and silver were mined in the New Worldwealth that soon drew the attention of England , France , and Holland . The Caribbean would become a free - for- all as these competing nations advocated \" privateering , \" basically the use of freelancing private sailors to fight battles , disrupt trade , and harass the Spanishall in an effort to establish a presence in the Caribbean without having to pay for a real navy there . The temptation of Spanish treasure stretched the thin line between privateer and pirate to a breaking point . One of the most famous privateers to cross into piracy is Sir Henry Morgan . Tapped by the British Governor of Jamaica to command more than 1,500 buccaneers , he responded by becoming one of the first true great pirates , leading daring attacks and conquests of Spanish colonies at Portobello and Panama and gaining a reputation for brutal acts such as hanging men by their genitals to get them to give up their possessions . The cycle of privateers and quasi-legal pirates continued for decades , until an extraordinary event changed everything in the Caribbean . Peace . Suddenly , tens of thousands of privateers and sailors were out of a job , and thus began the age of the outlaw pirates . TRUE CARIBBEAN PIRATES follows the lineage of maritime crime from Morgan to Calico Jack , and even on to female pirates such as Anne Bonny and Mary Read , who were far more sensational , and every bit as dangerous , as their male counterparts . Using the historians input , dramatization , animation , expert interviews , and archival imagery , and filmed in historic locations , TRUE CARIBBEAN PIRATES is the true story of piracy 's Golden Age . | | Highlights of TRUE CARIBBEAN PIRATES include : - Tale after tale of pirate lore that brings to life their unique realitya brazen flouting of almost every societal rule , disrespect for governmental authority , and unmatched thirst for adventure and brutality , all motivated by a true desire to be free and live their way , and only their way . - Understanding the pirates true motives and methodology for plying their trade , and dispelling time - honored myths such as those of treasure maps and buried booty . - The pirates unique ability to intimidate their targets into surrender , practiced uniquely by Blackbeard , who would tuck burning lengths of rope ( called \" slow match \" ) beneath his hat to create a cloud of smoke that observers swear made him look like Satan himself . - Blackbeards blockade and hostage crisis at Charlestowne , South Carolina , which sent ripples of pirate fear through the colonies and helped to galvanize support to take the pirates down , once and for all . - The establishment of all - pirate playground at Nassau , Bahamas , the city which became the home to seafaring outlaws after theyd been cast out of other areas . - The emergence of the unique and legendary Black Bart Roberts , the last of the great pirates and an anomaly in his own world refusing to drink alcohol and conducting religious services aboard his vessel , and then hanging an Island Governor from the yardarm of his own ship . - The brutal exploits of female pirates Anne Bonny and Mary Read , and their promiscuous liaisons aboard the ship captained by Calico Jack Rackham . - Executive Producer for The History Channel is Carl H.

Even now when one looks at the walls and buildings of the modern village it is hard not to feel some resentment when realising that parts of them were once components of something far more magnificent and so much diminished as a result . Situated within the Southern Inner Circle of the the henge is Avebury Chapel ...... Built during the 17th Century it is interesting to note that the religious superstitions of the medieval period must have dissipated considerably as the builders felt no qualms about using demolished megaliths in its construction . Richard Colt Hoare 's vision of how the henge originally appeared ( after William Stukeley ) A concrete plinth marks the location of a destroyed stone Although efforts to safeguard the monument started to be made in the 1870s it did n't become totally protected until Alexander Keiller became the owner of the site in the 1930s . Stones were broken up by heating with a fire and pouring water over them . Stukeley made a drawing of one such event . And this stupendous fabric , which for some thousands of years , had brav'd the continual assaults of weather , and by the nature of it , when left to itself , like the pyramids of Egypt , would have lasted as long as the globe , hath fallen a sacrifice to the wretched ignorance and avarice of a little village unluckily plac'd within it . William Stukeley William Stukeley produced a detailed plan of the henge on which he gives details showing the destruction dates of individual stones . This is a fascinating document to any serious student of Avebury 's history . It is divided it into 6 overlapping images . Each image is about 300 k so some patience is required on a slow connection . north west north centre north east south west south centre south east WILLIAM STUKELEY'S 1724 PLAN OF THE HENGE Richard Colt Hoare 's assessment of the surviving stones in 1815 reveals that the destruction continued unabated after William Stukeley had completed his survey . It was n't only the stones of the henge , avenues and Sanctuary that fell victim to the desires of the local inhabitants . The demise of other megaliths in the area are mentioned by Stukeley in his book . An example of a substantial feature which has now vanished is mentioned in the extract shown below .... It seems likely that many others have disappeared which were n't brought to the attention of Stukeley and a true picture of what once existed in the Avebury area will never be recovered with any certainty . from Abury - a Temple of the British Druids ( Chapter 9.page 46 . ) from William Stukeley 's \" Abury - a Temple of the British Druids \" ( Chapter 3.page 15 . ) Stone no .4 of the Henge as it was found in its medieval burial pit The burning pit where stone no . 17 of the Henge was destroyed To-day we treasure our heritage , especially in the British Isles where we are blessed with such an abundance of historical sites which reveal the life - styles and achievements of our ancestors . Anything that threatens them in any way is usually resisted with great force as we now are much more enlightened and appreciative of our past . Sadly no such sentiments prevailed at Avebury until relatively recent years and over several centuries the megaliths were subjected to considerable abuse . The first decimation of the monuments is believed to have begun during the medieval period when stone burying commenced . This has long been interpreted as an attempt by religious zealots to eradicate the stones from the landscape though this is now often disputed as the burying seems to have continued through the following centuries when land clearance may have been a more likely motive . The burying of these stones , however , was to prove quite benign compared to the fate that many others were to suffer later . The real brutal assault on the fabric of Avebury appears to have begun in the late 17th Century when the local inhabitants found ways of breaking up the stones so they could be used as building material . Now it seems almost impossible to believe that anyone could have such scant regard for such an incredible symbol of man 's achievement especially when such an abundance of unused stones still lay scattered around the surrounding downland . William Stukeley , who had to witness much of this destruction , knew many of the culprits , the most infamous of all being Tom Robinson a housing speculator . It is Stukeley 's chronicles and illustrations that are so valuable to -day in giving us an accurate record of what he found at Avebury . One can only imagine the depths of despair he must have felt at seeing the objects of his study being destroyed .

Adjoining the henge the two stone avenues were decimated to the point that the one leading to Beckhampton has vanished almost completely . Stukeley 's records were seen as the only good evidence of its presence until recent excavations confirmed its existence . On Overton Hill the Sanctuary was to also totally disappear ; its site not rediscovered until 1930 ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

The FBI has seen a sharp increase in \u201c business email crime , \u201d a simple scam that is also known as \u201c CEO fraud \u201d , with more than 12,000 victims affected globally . Cyber crime : How companies are hit by email scams Fraudsters are using clever impersonation techniques to siphon millions from unprotected businesses In the scam , a criminal mimics a chief executive 's email account and directs an employee to wire money to an overseas bank account . By the time the company realises it has been duped , the money is gone . The average loss is $ 120,000 but some companies have been tricked into sending as much as $ 90 m to offshore accounts , US authorities say . Reports of CEO fraud are accelerating . Between October 2013 and August 2015 , about $ 1.2 bn globally was lost to the scheme , the FBI said , but that loss increased by another $ 800 m in the past six months . US authorities have traced the money involved to 108 countries . \u201c Criminals do n't have borders and this is a global problem , \u201d said James Barnacle , chief of the FBI 's money laundering unit . \u201c We 're working with our criminal investigation resources , our cyber resources , our international operations divisions \u2014 which is all our legal attach\u00e9s overseas \u2014 and we 're working with foreign partners around the world to try to tackle this crime problem . \u201d The rise in reported CEO frauds can be partly attributed to companies detecting the crime , but it also reflects the simple nature of the scheme that can be run from anywhere around the globe . \u201c It 's easy . All you need is a computer , \u201d Mr Barnacle said . Most of the offshore bank accounts in which the money ends up are located in Asia or Africa , where it can be harder for the US to gain the assistance of local authorities . The FBI has seen similarities between different CEO fraud schemes but it is not clear if there is one dominant global ring . \u201c We 're putting more resource to it . We 're trying to find those patterns , \u201d Mr Barnacle said . The FBI advises companies to be more guarded with their information even if it means taking additional steps that are not cost-effective , such as making a phone call to the executive to confirm the transfer . The crime has hit very large companies and small ones . Most recently , there have been new reports in the US of criminals targeting real estate firms to steal closing fees on housing sales . Some companies have been asked by imposters to email employee wage and tax statements .

Basically , he wanted it to be the best thing his band has ever done . At last month 's HFStival in Baltimore , Grohl pointed to Led Zeppelin 's epic Physical Graffiti as the main inspiration for Honor , pointing to the album 's \" wide dynamic \" of music and emotion ( see \" Foo Fighter Dave Grohl Says Physical Graffiti Was Model For New LP \" ) . And \" emotion \" is certainly in no short supply on Honor , especially on the first single , \" The Best of You . \" When MTV News caught up with Grohl during last weekend 's \" 24 Hours of Foo , \" which found his band taking over MTV2 programming for an entire day , he was plenty tired \u2014 so tired that he took a nap immediately following our interview . Still , he had more than enough energy to talk about the Foos ' anthemic first single . \" ' Best of You ' is a song of resistance . It 's about the refusal to be taken advantage of by something that 's bigger than you , or someone you 're in love with . It 's the fight in the face of adversity , \" Grohl said . \" I did n't really think of an interesting melody ; I just wanted to scream the whole way through . And the first few times we rehearsed it , I thought , ' There 's no way I 'll be able to play this live . There 's blood in my throat . ' But now it 's great , it 's a release . When you go out and sing words from the heart , you scream twice as hard . \" There 's definitely a whole lot of screaming on \" Best of You , \" and the band needed a video that would match all that emotional outpouring . They got exactly that from director Mark Pellington , who rose to prominence more than a dozen years ago with his moody video for Pearl Jam 's \" Jeremy \" ( see \" Foo Fighters Get Serious With Director Of Pearl Jam 's ' Jeremy ' \" ) . In fact , it was Pellington himself who contacted the Foo Fighters about working on the video , feeling an attachment to the song that stemmed from the loss of his wife in 2004 . \" His wife had just died like nine or 10 months ago , and he had a real emotional attachment to the song , \" drummer Taylor Hawkins explained . \" At first he said that he could n't even do it , because it hit him so hard . And with anything you do , you want all the people working for you to be passionate , whether it 's the guy coming up with the lighting rig , the sound guy or the guy coming up with your video . And he really showed the most passion , whereas all the other treatments we had read were sort of , like , ' OK , this treatment had probably gone to Limp Bizkit before us , and they passed on it , so it was just revised for us . ' \" Though \" Best of You \" anchors the album 's heavy disc , there 's a whole other disc full of somber , acoustic tracks ( see \" Foo Fighters Album Preview : Grohl Gets Grand On In Your Honor \" ) . But just because the songs are quieter , that does n't mean they do n't pack the same emotional wallop of their hard - rock counterparts . In fact , it 's pretty fair to say Honor is the darkest , moodiest album the band has ever made . Which , Grohl said , was definitely intentional . \" When you 're writing songs that have a sort of anthemic quality , you ca n't really go lighthearted and sing about bullsh --. You have to dig into a deeper place to find the words , \" Grohl said . \" On this record , the whole band \u2014 not just me \u2014 showed ourselves what we 're capable of doing .

The remains of the bath house of the fort , established in AD 130 , are among the tallest Roman structures surviving in northern Britain : the walls stand almost 4 metres ( 13 feet ) high . Domestic use of the building in the Middle Ages led to the substantial preservation of the site . The site lay in Muncaster Castle Park in the post-medieval period , and was described as ' the ancient dwelling place of the Penningtons ' by John Denton in 1610 . Excavations in the late nineteenth century and survey work in the 1980s indicated that the bath house was a substantial structure extending beyond the present field boundary , as well as to either side of the existing structures . At least two rooms contained under-floor hypocausts ( heating systems ) . The walls are of regularly coursed sandstone bonded with mortar and rendered internally with pink cement . One of the doorways has a worn threshold and a broad groove to receive a timber doorframe . There are also the remains of windows . The bath house was for use both by Roman soldiers and for civilians who lived in the settlement outside the fort , which extended over much of the present field . The building offered facilities for exercise and sport , as well as for swimming , bathing and socialising .

The first known literary reference is about 1610 ( 5 ) when it is described as an old castle of the Pennington family . It was first considered to be Roman in 1876 ( 6 ) , and this was confirmed by excavation in 1881 when it was thought to be a villa ( 7 ) . These excavations demonstrated that the building had originally extended a considerable distance eastwards ; coins and pottery from the site date from the 2nd to the 4th century AD . The building seems to have been recognised as a bath house in about 1919 ( 8 ) .

Other confederates of this association include Marcia Lucas ( Mrs George Lucas ) , Virginia Zanuck ( Mrs Daryl Zanuck ) and Irene Selznick ( Mrs David O'Selznick ) \u2013 women whose partners peaked artistically when wed to them . This phenomenon is n't limited to first wives , or even wives \u2013 there are plenty of unsung collaborators in filmmaking who never get the credit they deserve ( for instance , Sam Wasson 's recent book on the making of Chinatown only recently shone some much - needed light on Edward Taylor 's extensive contributions to Robert Towne 's career ) . But there is something particularly poignant about the notion of someone owing a great deal of their success to their spouse , then betraying that spouse , emotionally , sexually and professionally \u2026 and paying for it , at least on a creative level . Such was the case of J. Lee Thompson and Joan Henry . Most film buffs would know Thompson , the British writer - producer - director whose credits include The Guns of Navarone , the 1962 Cape Fear and some of Charles Bronson 's worst movies . Henry is less well - remembered today , although at one stage her fame ( or , rather notoriety ) outstripped Thompson's . She was born in 1914 in Belgravia , London . Henry had a classy lineage \u2013 she was descended from two British Prime Ministers ( John Russell and Robert Peel ) , and her mother 's cousin was the philosopher Bertrand Russell . It was n't an easy life , though \u2013 her father deserted the family when Joan was young , causing her mother to have a breakdown ; Joan and her twin sister were brought up by her grandparents in Ireland , and that sister died when Joan was 21 , causing much anguish to the surviving sibling . Joan was a debutante , making her \u201c debut \u201d in 1932 , and she married an army officer in 1938 . They had one daughter but World War Two put the marriage under such strain that they eventually broke up . Henry started writing romance novels to bring in some money and developed a gambling habit which resulted in her passing a forged cheque ; she claimed it was n't her fault but the police did n't believe her , nor did the jury assigned to her case : in 1951 , Joan Henry was sentenced to twelve months in prison . She wound up serving eight , most of it at the legendary Holloway Prison , with the rest at Askham Grange Open Prison , a newer , more reformist institution . Former debutantes - cum-romance - novelists - cum - prison - inmates were not common at the time \u2013 it was suggested Henry write a memoir about her experiences , which she did . The result , Who Lie in Gaol , became a bestseller and media sensation on its publication in 1952 , drawing attention to the treatment of female prisoners in Britain . The book was read by director J. Lee Thompson , who wanted to adapt it into a movie . Thompson was born the same year as Henry . He had been something of a child prodigy , claiming to have written forty plays by the time he was 18 , the year he married his first wife . One of those forty plays , Double Error , had a short run on the West End in 1935 , which helped Thompson break into the British film industry as a writer and dialogue director . He rewrote Double Error as Murder Without Crime which had success on the stage in London and Broadway in the 1940s . After war service , Thompson returned to writing but when he sold the film rights to Murder without Crime , he decided to direct it as well . The film was released in 1950 and Thompson established himself as a solid helmer of B pictures such as The Yellow Balloon and For Better or For Worse . He was ambitious to do something more , and was impressed by Who Lie in Gaol . Thompson 's backers at Associated British agreed to finance a film version , which became The Weak and the Wicked ( 1954 ) , starring Glynis Johns as ( basically ) Joan Henry , and co-starring Diana Dors and John Gregson . The movie is a first - rate women - in- prison melodrama : powerful , realistic , and not without humour ; Diana Dors , up until then more famous for being famous than her acting , was a revelation , and it was Thompson 's best directing work to date . The movie was a big hit at the box office and put Thompson in the \u201c A \u201d leagues : the Rank Organisation offered him As Long as They 're Happy , and Associated British gave him a big budget for An Alligator Named Daisy ( Diana Dors was in both , incidentally ) . Thompson wanted to make a story about a man on death row . Henry suggested they do it about a woman , so that she could draw on her personal experience ; she wound up writing a novel called Yield to the Night ( 1954 ) , about a woman who is executed for committing murder . Thompson succeeded in setting up the film version at Associated British ; Henry co-wrote the script , Thompson directed , and Dors starred . The result was a masterpiece , a stunningly good drama , where Dors plays a character who never asks for sympathy but gets it anyway : she 's guilty of the crime , is n't friendly to her family or death penalty protestors , still loves the louse who drove her to murder . The movie is full of little touches that speak volumes for Henry 's personal experience in prison \u2013 the routine of changing guards , the conversations , the way the seconds drag on by , the visiting officials , the small privileges , the overwhelming pressure of the longing for a reprieve \u2013 and the final moments are devastating : it 's one of the best British movies of the decade . Lazy critics claimed the film was inspired by the case of Ruth Ellis , who turned out to be the last woman hung in Britain ( she was played by Miranda Richardson in the 1985 film Dance with a Stranger ) ; the novel was actually published a year before Ellis committed her murder . Overlooking this fact served to downplay the skill of Henry 's contribution to Yield to the Night \u2013 her story did have parallels with Ellis ' case , but that was due more to Henry 's own insight , which predicted the future with such accuracy . Joan Henry had provided the material for Thompson 's two best movies to date \u2013 smart , passionate , tense , beautifully done . The two clearly had rapport on a personal level as well : Thompson left his wife of twenty years and two children to be with Henry , who he married in 1958 . It was not the first time a director had fallen in love with his screenwriter ; it may have been the first time one did so after reading that screenwriter 's memoir about being in prison , which he turned into a movie . The next few years were the golden period of Thompson 's career \u2013 he went on to make The Good Companions ( 1957 ) , a jolly musical ; Woman in a Dressing Gown ( 1957 ) , a tough drama about adultery , from a script by Ted Willis ; Ice Cold in Alex ( 1958 ) , a brilliant war suspense tale ; North West Frontier ( 1959 ) , an exciting Imperial adventure movie starring Kenneth More , shot in India ; Tiger Bay ( 1959 ) , a thriller that introduced Hayley Mills to the screen ; No Trees in the Street ( 1959 ) , a social realist melodrama , again from a script by Willis ; and I Aim at the Stars ( 1960 ) , a biopic of Werner Van Braun . Then he received a call from producer Carl Foreman to replace director Alexander Mackendrick on The Guns of Navarone ( 1961 ) , an expensive all - star action movie based on a novel by Alistair Maclean . Thompson 's work at such short notice impressed star Gregory Peck , who hired the Englishman to direct Cape Fear ( 1962 ) . It was an incredible run : few filmmakers had a hot streak like J. Lee Thompson from 1956 to 1962 . All the movies were well - reviewed ( on the whole ) ; Robert Mitchum gave one of the all - time iconic performances in Cape Fear ; ditto Hayley Mills in Tiger Bay , Yvonne Mitchell in Woman , and John Mills and Sylvia Syms in Alex . Commercially , things were even better : Cape Fear , Tiger Bay , Northwest Frontier , Woman and Alex were all solid hits , and Navarone a box-office phenomenon . J. Lee Thompson had become one of the most in - demand directors in the world . The success seems to have come at a domestic cost . By 1962 , the director was being seen in the company of actor Susan Hampshire , and Thompson was telling the press he was unable to make up his mind between Hampshire and Henry ( seriously , he told the press this ) . Later that year , it was reported that he had broken it off with both women and was dating actor Shirley Ann Field . Thompson would eventually divorce Henry and marry a third time in the late 1960s . Coincidence or not , the overall quality of J. Lee Thompson 's films declined sharply after things ended with Joan Henry . He made two bloated epics with Yul Brynner ( Taras Bulba and Kings of the Sun ) , two bloated comedies with Shirley Maclaine ( What a Way to Go , John Goldfarb Please Come Home ) , two patchy thrillers ( Return from the Ashes , Eye of the Devil ) , two bloated reunions with Gregory Peck ( Mackenna 's Gold , The Chairman ) , two attempts at returning to more intimate dramas ( Before Winter Comes , Country Dance ) , two solid sequels to The Planet of the Apes ( Conquest of the Planet of the Apes , Battle for the Planet of the Apes ) , two TV movies ( A Great American Tragedy , Widow ) , and a musical ( Huckleberry Finn ) . There were some excellent moments in all these movies \u2013 I 'm a particular fan of Eye of the Devil and the Apes films \u2013 but his overall average had dropped . He certainly never reached the heights of Navarone , Yield to the Night , Cape Fear , or Tiger Bay . Thompson at least found his commercial niche again in the mid 1970s as a director of Charles Bronson vehicles , starting with St Ives in 1976 . The two men would make eight more movies together , of decreasing ambition : The White Buffalo , Capo Blanco , 10 to Midnight , The Evil That Men Do , Murphy 's Law , Death Wish 4 , Messenger of Death , and Kinjite : Forbidden Subjects . Amidst this run , Thompson also tried his hand at a Europudding war movie ( The Passage ) , a fake biopic ( The Greek Tycoon ) , a slasher ( Happy Birthday to Me ) , two comedy adventures with stars not used to making them ( King Solomon 's Mines with Richard Chamberlain , Firewalker with Chuck Norris ) , and Rock Hudson 's last theatrical feature ( The Ambassador ) . Most of his later films were financed by Cannon Pictures . Thompson was aware of his artistic decline . In 1992 , he said \u201c I have certain regrets now . I would rather have stuck to making films like Yield to the Night which had some integrity and importance . But the British film industry caved in . I suppose I sort of sold out . \u201d In 2000 , two years before his death , he warned young directors , \u201c Do n't make a film for the sake of making it . Make it only if you really believe in it . Then success will eventually come to you . \u201d He rarely mentioned Joan Henry in interviews . Joan Henry 's subsequent career was n't as well publicised as Thompson 's , but she still kept active . She wrote the screenplay for Passionate Summer ( 1958 ) , a film for the Rank Organisation starring Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers that had little impact . She wrote for the stage with Look on Tempests ( 1960 ) , the first play dealing explicitly with the subject of homosexuality to be passed by the Lord Chamberlain ( possibly because the gay characters are discussed , not seen on stage \u2013 which might be why the play was not a hit ) . She wrote some TV plays , Rough Justice and Person to Person , but neither had had the impact of her first two novels . She died in 2001 , one year before Thompson . How influential was Joan Henry to J. Lee Thompson 's career ? It 's easy to gauge in the case of The Weak and the Wicked and Yield to the Night : neither would have existed without her . It gets harder for the other movies made during their marriage : she 's not credited on any of them . But one can look at patterns . The female roles during his 1956 - 62 period were incredibly strong \u2013 giving career - high roles to actors like Glynis Johns , Diana Dors , Yvonne Mitchell , Hayley Mills , Polly Bergen , Barrie Chase and Sylvia Syms . After Thompson 's marriage to Henry ended , the quality of female parts in his movies dropped away . He continued to be interested in young actresses \u2013 at different times he put Samantha Eggar , Shirley Ann Field and Talitha Pol under personal contract \u2013 but none of them had the opportunities of his ' 56 - 62 posse ( Pol , one of the most stunning actors of the sixties , which is saying something , later married John Paul Getty , quit acting and died of a heroin overdose ) . An interesting contrast is Thompson 's treatment of rape in Cape Fear ( Henry period ) and The Passage ( non - Henry ) . The former is a terrifying examination of that crime , with a particularly memorable subplot involving the impact of assault on a victim played by Barrie Chase ( giving a superb performance ) ; in the latter , the rape of a woman ( Kay Lenz ) at the hands of an SS Officer ( Malcolm McDowell ) is treated in an exploitative , camp way ( McDowell wears underpants with a swastika on them , Lenz is shown topless in a shower ) \u2026 it seems like a movie directed by an entirely different person . Thompson never had the same run of strong scripts that he did from ' 56 - 62 either . \u201c I freely admit I 've done some pretty bad stuff , \u201d he said in 1969 . \u201c It 's entirely my own fault . The trouble was I accepted some dismal scripts . I was n't tough enough \u2026 Writing is the fundamental thing . \u201d He tried to get out of action , making risky films like Before Winter Comes ( a tale of post - war refugees ) , Country Dance ( incest ) , A Great American Tragedy ( middle aged unemployment ) , Widow ( about a widow ) , and The White Buffalo ( Charles Bronson as Captain Ahab out west ) \u2013 but he could n't get there . What happened ? My theory : if you were a director married to a talented writer , it makes sense that you would get her to look at scripts , ask her opinion about things . If you cheated on that wife with starlets , it makes sense that that option may no longer be available . In his memoir One Man Tango , Anthony Quinn says that when Thompson started work on The Guns of Navarone the director refused to read a script and \u201c his direction consisted of one arbitrary decision after another : Gregory Peck would smoke a pipe ; I would grab a knife and look menacing ; David Niven would tinker with dynamite \u2026 Thompson had a tossed - off piece of business for each of us . \u201d Was this tossed off ? Or were they suggestions from Henry to make sure the lead characters in an ensemble piece were all distinct and easily identifiable ? Because there is a notable lack of similar bits of business in something like The Passage , where it is hard to tell the characters apart . Quinn went on to write that on Navarone Thompson \u201c Never read a scene until he had to shoot it and approached each shot on a whim . And yet the cumulative effect was astonishing . Lee Thompson made a marvelous picture but how ? Perhaps his inventiveness lay in defying convention , in rejecting the accepted methods of motion picture making and establishing his own . Perhaps it was in his very formlessness that he found the one form he could sustain , and nurture , the one form that could , in turn , sustain and nurture him . Perhaps he was just a lucky Englishman who pulled a good picture out of his ass . \u201d Or perhaps he had a wife at home giving him script advice which he could pass off on set as his own wisdom . Maybe Henry 's input was limited . But maybe it was n't . My own take is that Henry 's relationship with Thompson was analogous to Harrison Ford 's with the screenwriter Melissa Mathison ( she wrote ET , among others ) . The latter duo were married from 1983 to 2004 , Ford 's peak years of stardom , where he seemed to go from hit to hit ( a few stumbles , absolutely but the average was high ) . You would consistently read interviews with directors from this time who would comment on Ford giving \u201c excellent notes on the script \u201d . From the early 2000s onward , his record becomes a lot more patchy . Now , there could be plenty of reasons for this ( and my definition of \u201c patchy \u201d may be different from yours ) \u2013 but I would argue a contributing factor might just possibly be the fact that Melissa Mathison was n't giving him script advice anymore . And the same could be true for Joan Henry and J. Lee Thompson . The one Latin phrase I remember from my law days is \u201c Res ipsa loquitur \u201d which means \u201c the thing itself speaks \u201d . It 's used in negligence cases and means you can infer negligence from the nature of an accident or injury in the absence of direct evidence on how any defendant behaved . Look at the films J. Lee Thompson made when he was with Joan Henry . Then look at the ones he did without her . I believe , it 's a case of Res ipsa loquitur \u2013 the thing itself speaks . He was never as good without her ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Bennett , a former boxer and ex - Navy sailor , quickly established himself as the auto tycoon 's right - hand man after joining Ford Motor Co. in 1916 . Until his ouster in 1945 by Ford 's grandson , Henry II , Bennett carried out Henry Ford 's orders , often using violence . Other than Henry Ford 's wife , Clara , Bennett was perhaps the person closest to the auto pioneer during the final decades of Ford 's life . Bennett lorded over Ford 's notorious Service Department , a force of up to 8,000 . They monitored Ford employees , intimidated union organizers , delivered punishments and guarded Ford and his family . \" Harry Bennett did whatever he was told , \" said Ford historian and University of Michigan professor David Lewis . \" So he did a good deal of Henry Ford 's dirty work . \" Most notably , that dirty work included fighting the burgeoning power of the United Auto Workers union . Henry Ford hated labor unions and wanted them defeated . Bennett assumed that charge , culminating in the Battle of the Overpass in 1937 . Bennett would stay at Ford another eight years , but his employment depended on Henry Ford 's patronage . After the founder moved to the sidelines , the Ford family sent Bennett packing . Where it began According to various published reports and Bennett himself , a street fight was his pathway to corporate America after the Navy in 1916 . By most accounts , Bennett came to the aid of a friend engaged in a brawl with a New York customs officer . A Hearst newspaper columnist saw him and introduced him to Henry Ford . After asking Bennett , 24 , whether he could shoot , Ford offered him a job . Over the next 29 years , Bennett 's chores included covering up Henry Ford 's dalliances , firing executives and harassing jurors in a defamation lawsuit against Henry Ford in 1927 . He took over the Service Department at the Rouge plant in 1921 . By 1927 , Bennett was among the top six men at Ford Motor , according to historian Lewis . \" I got things done , \" said Bennett in 1973 . \" That 's why Mr. Ford liked me . \" Lewis described Bennett as \" a substitute son \" for Henry Ford . Ford admired Bennett 's rougher qualities and hoped they would brush off on his son , Edsel . By the mid-1930s , much of Bennett 's malevolence was directed at the UAW . \" Henry Ford received most of the national attention and criticism , but it was Harry Bennett who was often the driving force behind Ford 's attempt to stymie the union movement , \" wrote Ford 's great - grandson and current Ford Motor CEO Bill Ford in his 1979 senior thesis at Princeton University . In 1933 , Bennett 's men defeated union drives at plants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania . But a bigger clash was to come on May 26 , 1937 . When UAW organizers gathered to distribute leaflets on an overpass at the Rouge plant , Bennett set out to quash them . In front of photographers and reporters , Bennett 's thugs beat the union activists , including Walter Reuther . Photos of the organizers bloodied in the Battle of the Overpass were printed in newspapers across the USA . It would be four more years before a wildcat strike and Henry Ford 's capitulation forced Harry Bennett to sign a deal with the UAW . But Bennett had a final confrontation to come . Farewell After Edsel Ford died in May 1943 , Henry Ford wanted to make Bennett president of Ford Motor . But Clara Ford and Edsel 's widow , Eleanor , would n't hear of it . Instead , Bennett joined the board of directors in June 1943 and conspired with Henry Ford to draft a codicil to Ford 's will . It effectively gave Bennett control of Ford Motor after Henry Ford 's death , to the exclusion of Ford 's grandsons . When the eldest grandson , Henry II , discovered the codicil , his confidant John Bugas confronted Bennett , who burned the document . The Ford women again stepped up and convinced Henry Ford to hand control to Henry II . The reins were passed in September 1945 . On September 21 , 1945 , Henry Ford II fired the family rival . Bennett was out . The era of the Whiz Kids , the group of savvy young executives hired by Henry Ford II , had begun ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Georgian , Russian and South Ossetian forces were all involved . There were also clashes in Abkhazia , and Russian attacks on other parts of Georgia . The separatist administrations in South Ossetia and Abkhazia have been trying to gain formal independence since breaking away in the early 1990s . Russia has now recognised them as independent - a move condemned by Western nations . Tensions in both regions began to escalate after Mikheil Saakashvili was elected Georgian president in 2004 , on a promise to re-unite the country . The conflicts had remained largely frozen , despite occasional flare - ups , before August 2008 . What triggered the crisis ? A series of clashes between Georgian and South Ossetian forces in the summer of 2008 prompted Georgia to launch an aerial bombardment and ground attack on South Ossetia on 7 August . Georgian forces controlled the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali , for part of the following day . Russia , meanwhile , poured thousands of troops into South Ossetia , and launched bombing raids both over the province and on targets in the rest of Georgia . There have been unverified reports of war crimes on both sides . Did the Russian forces enter South Ossetia before or after the Georgian attack ? This is unclear . Georgia says it began its assault after learning that a large convoy of Russian armour was coming through the Roki tunnel , from North Ossetia into South Ossetia . Russia says it acted to defend Russian citizens in South Ossetia , and its own peacekeepers stationed in the breakaway region . How did the conflict develop ? Russian forces occupied parts of Georgia adjoining South Ossetia , including the town of Gori , a strategic town on the main road linking eastern and western Georgia . They also moved from bases in Abkhazia into parts of western Georgia , and the Russian fleet went into action against the Georgian navy . Abkhaz forces recaptured the Kodori Gorge - a region of Abkhazia taken by Georgian troops in 2006 . Who are the main casualties ? Large numbers of civilians were driven out of their homes in South Ossetia . Many South Ossetians crossed over to the Russian republic of North Ossetia . Residents of Georgian villages in South Ossetia , and the town of Gori , also fled . The heavy fighting left the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali , largely in ruins . Why is Russia involved ? More than half of South Ossetia 's 70,000 citizens are said to have taken up Moscow 's offer of Russian citizenship . Russia says its actions were designed to protect those citizens . Russia also had peacekeepers based in South Ossetia . Some of these were killed in the Georgian attack on 7 August . Until recently , Russia said it respected Georgia 's territorial integrity , and only wanted to look out for Russian citizens . But , following Georgia 's military action , Russia recognised the independence of both South Ossetia and Abkhazia on 26 August . The US and France were swift to condemn Russia 's move , calling it \" regrettable , \" while the the UK categorically rejected it . Nato said the declaration violated numerous UN Security Council resolutions that Russia itself had endorsed . Russia has also signed friendship treaties with the breakaway regions , formalising diplomatic ties and pledging military assistance . Does Georgia have links to Nato ? President Saakashvili has made membership of Nato one of his main goals - and Nato agreed in April 2008 that Georgia would become a member of the alliance at some unspecified date in the future . The country has had a close relationship with the United States - sending troops to join the US - led coalition in Iraq . The US has helped to train and arm the Georgian military . It also helped Georgian troops return from Iraq after the Russian incursion into South Ossetia . What is the status of South Ossetia ? South Ossetia has run its own affairs since fighting for independence from Georgia in 1991 - 92 , in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union . Like the other breakaway region , Abkhazia , it declared its independence - but so far only Russia and Nicaragua have recognised them . Why do Ossetians want to break away ? The Ossetians are a distinct ethnic group originally from the Russian plains just south of the Don river . In the 13th Century , they were pushed southwards by Mongol invasions into the Caucasus mountains , settling along the border with Georgia . South Ossetians want to join up with their ethnic brethren in North Ossetia , which is an autonomous republic within the Russian Federation . Ethnic Georgians are a minority in South Ossetia , accounting for less than one - third of the population . But Georgia rejects even the name South Ossetia , preferring to call it by the ancient name of Samachablo , or Tskhinvali , after its main city . Are tensions over energy supplies a factor in the conflict ? A Western-sponsored pipeline has been pumping Caspian oil from Azerbaijan through Georgia to Turkey 's Mediterranean coast . The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan ( BTC ) pipeline can deliver up to 1.2 million barrels per day ( b/d ) of oil to Western markets . But the flow has been suspended since an explosion on part of the line in eastern Turkey in August . The Georgia conflict has delayed a resumption of deliveries . A smaller oil export pipeline runs from Azerbaijan to Georgia 's Black Sea port of Supsa . There are plans for another pipeline to take natural gas from Azerbaijan and Central Asia , via Turkey to Austria . The EU and US are anxious to diversify their energy sources , to avoid being too dependent on supplies transiting through Russia . Moscow already controls an oil export pipeline running from the Caspian to the Black Sea via the North Caucasus . Russian troops did not try to seize the BTC pipeline - and Moscow did not highlight energy as an issue in the conflict . But fears of instability in the Caucasus have made Western leaders and investors reassess their reliance on the region 's energy sources . How has the international community responded to the conflict ? The US has expressed solidarity and backing for Georgia , calling Russia 's actions \" an illegitimate , unilateral attempt to change the country 's borders by force \" . On a trip to Georgia , US Vice - President Dick Cheney said Russia 's actions had cast \" grave doubt \" on the country 's reliability as a partner within the international system . Georgia 's European neighbours have been somewhat more divided over how to react to the crisis at their heart . At an emergency summit in Brussels , some member states pushed for sanctions against Russia , seeking to isolate the country . In the end , the EU condemned Russia 's actions , called for it to meet the terms of the French -brokered ceasefire and suspended talks on a new partnership agreement with the bloc . The US has pledged to provide a $ 1 bn ( \u00a3 564 m ) aid package for reconstruction , resettlement and humanitarian needs . The IMF too has agreed in principle to give Georgia a $ 750 m ( \u00a3 422 m ) loan to help repair the conflict 's damage . What are EU observers doing in Georgia ? The European Union has sent more than 200 observers to Georgia , in line with a 12 August ceasefire deal brokered by French President Nicolas Sarkozy . Their operation began on 1 October and their mission 's initial duration is one year . The unarmed observers , from 22 EU countries , are working in close co-ordination with the United Nations and the European security body , the OSCE . One of their key tasks was to monitor the Russian troop withdrawal from \" security zones \" established by Russia around South Ossetia and Abkhazia . Russia completed its troop pull - out as promised by 10 October , but it plans to keep nearly 8,000 troops in Abkhazia and South Ossetia . Russia has refused to let the monitors enter the two breakaway regions . The EU observers have the task of ensuring that the situation stabilises in the conflict zone , that human rights are not violated there and that internally displaced people can return home . Their liaison work is aimed at confidence - building and an easing of tensions . How does the conflict mark a change in Russia 's relations with the world ? Russian intervention in Georgia has been followed by an explicit shift in the country 's foreign policy , laid out by the president . Mr Medvedev has pledged to continue to defend the lives and dignity of its citizens , wherever they are located . He said that while Russia does not seek isolation , and desires friendly relations with Europe and the US , it cannot accept a world order that places a single state - even the US - as sole global decision - maker . Russia , he said , seeks to maintain privileged interests in its spheres of influence - including those bordering the country ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

There is no state more beautiful than Hawaii and there are no people friendlier . When I was 17 years old , my family spent a summer in Hawaii and it was one of the most wonderful experiences of my life . I ca n't swim to save my life and I have a morbid fear of drowning but , when I was in Hawaii , I happily walked into the ocean . Not far into the ocean , of course . But still , everyone in my family was amazed . Of course , eventually I saw a jelly fish floating towards me and I screamed and ran back to the beach . ( After reaching the safety of the beach , I realized that the jelly fish was actually just seaweed but still , it was scary -looking ! ) Hawaii is just the type of state that makes you appreciate life and take risks . For instance , consider the two main characters in Roger Corman 's 1958 film , She Gods of Shark Reef . Chris ( Bill Cord ) and Lee ( Don Durant ) are brothers who live in Hawaii . Chris has blonde hair and a good attitude towards life . Lee has dark hair and a criminal nature . Chris loves the ocean . Lee loves to run guns . After Lee kills two men , he stows away on Chris 's boat . When the boat then hits a storm , Chris and Lee wash up on the shores of an isolated beach . It 's a beautiful island but all Lee can think about is how he can make money off of his current predicament . Bad Lee , bad ! Anyway , it turns out that the island is inhabited by an all - female village of pearl divers . Everyone is excited by the arrival of two handsome , shirtless men . Everyone except for Queen Pua ( Jeanne Gerson ) , who does n't trust either one of them and who does n't appear to want anyone in the world to be happy . She 's especially upset when Chris interrupts a plan to sacrifice a villager to the shark gods of the sea . Chris not only rescues but also falls in love with Mahia ( Lisa Montell ) . While Chris is busy falling in love , Lee is trying to figure out a way to escape from the island before a rescue boat arrives . Lee , after all , is a wanted criminal and the last thing that he wants is to go from being shipwrecked to imprisoned . Lee comes up with a plan for himself , his brother , and Mahia to escape the island . However , Lee being Lee , he just ca n't overcome his greedy nature . As quickly becomes obvious , Karma is not only a bitch but it 's a shark as well . She Gods of Shark Reef was directed by Roger Corman . Though the film 's low budget is obvious in every frame , Corman wisely decided to concentrate on the island 's beauty as opposed to the movie 's somewhat haphazard story . This is one of those films where the action stops for nearly five minutes so that Corman can film a hula dancer . But you know what ? That 's okay ! The beauty of Hawaii and the surrounding ocean carry the film . You do n't watch for the plot . Instead , you watch for the blue water and the green grass and the vibrant skies . This is a film that you watch for the island scenery and the sharks . Both of them are quite nice ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

The pathologist sends your doctor a report that gives a diagnosis for each sample taken . Information in this report will be used to help manage your care . The questions and answers that follow are meant to help you understand medical language you might find in the pathology report from a breast biopsy , such as a needle biopsy or an excision biopsy . In a needle biopsy , a needle is used to remove a sample of an abnormal area . An excision biopsy removes the entire abnormal area , often with some of the surrounding normal tissue . An excision biopsy is much like a type of breast - conserving surgery called a lumpectomy . What is carcinoma ? This is a term used to describe a cancer that begins in the lining layer ( epithelial cells ) of organs like the breast . Nearly all breast cancers are carcinomas . What is in - situ carcinoma ( or carcinoma in situ ) of the breast ? This term is used for the earliest stage of breast cancer , when it is confined to the layer of cells where it began . The normal breast is made of tiny tubes ( ducts ) that end in a group of sacs ( lobules ) . Cancer starts in the cells lining the ducts or lobules , when a normal cell becomes a carcinoma cell . As long as the carcinoma cells are still confined to the breast ducts or lobules , and do not break out and grow into surrounding tissue , it is considered in - situ carcinoma ( also known as carcinoma in situ , or CIS ) . Once the carcinoma cells have grown and broken out of the ducts or lobules , it is called invasive or infiltrating carcinoma . In an invasive carcinoma , the tumor cells can spread ( metastasize ) to other parts of your body . What does it mean if my in - situ carcinoma is called ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) , intraductal carcinoma , or in - situ carcinoma with duct and lobular features ? There are 2 main types of in - situ carcinoma of the breast : ductal carcinoma in - situ ( DCIS ) and lobular carcinoma in situ ( LCIS ) . Intraductal carcinoma is another name for ductal carcinoma in - situ . LCIS is discussed on a different page . Sometimes DCIS and LCIS are both found in the same biopsy . In - situ carcinoma with duct and lobular features means that the in - situ carcinoma looks like DCIS in some ways and LCIS in some ways ( when looked at under the microscope ) , and so the pathologist ca n't call it one or the other . If DCIS is left untreated , it can go on to become an invasive cancer , so it is often called a pre-cancer . Still , we do n't really understand it well . We do n't think that all DCIS would go on to become invasive cancer , but we ca n't tell which DCIS would be safe to leave untreated . Treatment is aimed at getting rid of all the DCIS , usually by surgery . In some cases , radiation ( radiotherapy ) or hormone therapy ( like tamoxifen ) is given after surgery to lower the chance that it will come back later ( recur ) or that invasive carcinoma will occur . What does it mean if my report mentions E-cadherin ? E-cadherin is a test that the pathologist might use to help determine if the carcinoma in situ is ductal or lobular . If your report does not mention E-cadherin , it means that this test was not needed to make the distinction . What does it mean if my report describes my ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) as being cribriform , micropapillary , apocrine , comedo , with comedonecrosis , papillary , or solid ? These terms are used to describe certain ways that the DCIS looks under the microscope . Some of these are linked to a higher chance that the DCIS may come back after treatment , so finding them may change your treatment . Your doctor should discuss this with you . What does it mean if my ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) is described as being low grade , intermediate grade , or high grade ; or nuclear grade 1 , nuclear grade 2 , or nuclear grade 3 ; or low mitotic rate , intermediate mitotic rate , or high mitotic rate ? These are all different ways of describing how the DCIS looks under the microscope : - DCIS that is high grade , is nuclear grade 3 , or has a high mitotic rate is more likely to come back ( recur ) after it is removed with surgery . - DCIS that is low grade , is nuclear grade 1 , or has a low mitotic rate is less likely to come back after surgery . - DCIS that is intermediate grade , is nuclear grade 2 , or has an intermediate mitotic rate falls in between these two . Patients with higher grade DCIS may need additional treatment . What is the significance of the reported size of the ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) ? If the entire tumor or area of DCIS is removed ( such as in an excisional biopsy or breast - conserving surgery ) , the pathologist will say how big the DCIS is by measuring how long it is across ( in greatest dimension ) , either by looking at it under the microscope or by gross examination ( just looking at it with the naked eye ) of the tissue taken out at surgery . Another way to measure DCIS is to note the number of microscopic slides that contain DCIS . For example , the report may say that DCIS was found in 3 slides . On needle biopsy , measurements of the area of DCIS are not often reported because this type of biopsy only samples a part of the tumor . Later , when the entire area of DCIS is removed ( with surgery ) , an accurate measurement can be done . The larger the area of DCIS , the more likely it is to come back ( recur ) after surgery . Doctors use information about the size of the DCIS when recommending further treatments . What does it mean if my report mentions Paget disease ? Paget disease ( also called Paget 's disease , Paget disease of the nipple , or Paget disease of the breast ) is when cells resembling the cells of ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) are found in the skin of the nipple and the nearby skin ( the areola ) . Paget disease of the nipple is usually associated with DCIS or invasive carcinoma ( cancer ) in the underlying breast tissue . If Paget disease is found on needle or punch biopsy , more tissue in that area usually needs to be removed with the goal of entirely removing the area of Paget disease . Talk to your doctor about the best treatment for you . What does it mean if my report mentions special tests such as high molecular weight cytokeratin ( HMWCK ) , CK903 , CK5 / 6 , p63 , muscle specific actin , smooth muscle myosin heavy chain , calponin , or keratin ? These are special tests that the pathologist sometimes uses to help make the diagnosis of DCIS . Not all cases need these tests . Whether your report does or does not mention these tests has no bearing on the accuracy of your diagnosis . What does it mean if my report on ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) mentions estrogen receptor ( ER ) or progesterone receptor ( PR ) ? ER and PR are special tests that the pathologist does that are important in predicting response of the DCIS to hormone therapy ( like tamoxifen ) . Testing for ER is done for most cases of DCIS , but testing for PR is not typically needed . Results for ER and PR are reported separately and can be reported in different ways : - Negative , weakly positive , positive - Percent positive - Percent positive with something saying whether the staining is weak , moderate , or strong Ask your doctor how these results will affect your treatment . What if my report on ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) mentions margins or ink ? When the entire area of DCIS is removed , the outside surface ( edges or margins ) of the specimen is coated with ink , sometimes even with different colors of ink on different sides of the specimen . The pathologist looks at slides of the DCIS under the microscope to see how close the DCIS cells get to the ink ( the edges or margins of the specimen ) . If DCIS is touching the ink ( called positive margins ) , it can mean that some DCIS cells were left behind , and more surgery or other treatments may be needed . Sometimes , though , the surgeon has already removed more tissue ( at surgery ) to help make sure that this is n't needed . If your pathology report shows DCIS with positive margins , your doctor will talk to you about what treatment is best . What does it mean if my report also mentions atypical ductal hyperplasia ( ADH ) or atypical lobular hyperplasia ( ALH ) ? These findings are less serious than DCIS , and you should talk with your doctor about what these findings may mean to your care . What does it mean if my report also uses any of the following terms : usual ductal hyperplasia , adenosis , sclerosing adenosis , radial scar , complex sclerosing lesion , papillomatosis , papilloma , apocrine metaplasia , cysts , columnar cell change , collagenous spherulosis , duct ectasia , fibrocystic changes , flat epithelial atypia , or columnar alteration with prominent apical snouts and secretions ( CAPSS ) ? All of these are terms for benign ( non - cancerous changes ) that the pathologist might see under the microscope . They are not important when seen on a biopsy where there is DCIS . What does it mean if my report mentions microcalcifications or calcifications ? Microcalcifications or calcifications are calcium deposits that can be found in both non- cancerous and cancerous breast lesions . They can be seen both on mammograms and under the microscope . Because certain calcifications are found in areas containing cancer , their presence on a mammogram may lead to a biopsy of the area . Then , when the biopsy is done , the pathologist looks at the tissue removed to be sure that it contains calcifications . If the calcifications are there , the treating physician knows that the biopsy sampled the correct area ( the abnormal area with calcifications that was seen on the mammogram ) . What does it mean if my doctor asks for a special molecular ( genomic ) test , such as Oncotype DX\u00ae , to be done on my specimen ? Molecular tests may help predict the chances of DCIS coming back ( recurring ) in the breast , but not all cases need these tests . The results should be discussed with your doctor . The results do not affect your diagnosis , although they might affect your treatment .

The women must have numbered in the hundreds . Soon thereafter the army assembled them in queues and segregated them in age groups . The ones considered infertile were shot on spot , while the ones considered capable of bearing children kept aside , to reside in a rape camp for the next several months to come . The army commander gave out an order to his soldiers , \u201c these women have to be impregnated . \u201d The idea was to produce a Pakistan loyal to their nation and religion . This bone chilling scene from director Mrityunjay Devvrat 's film , \u201c Children of war \u201d was barely fictional . It was a rude representation of a less talked about , hardly chronicled account of Bangladesh 's past that went on to haunt the memories and consciousness of the newly formed nation in 1971 . As Bangladesh celebrates yet another anniversary of victory day , it might be useful to remember those women and children who paid the heaviest price for the birth of the new nation . Rape as a tool of violence during wars is hardly a new phenomenon . It had been used on thousands of occasions in the ancient past , the medieval tussle for powers and the wars of the twentieth century including the two world wars . The rationale has always been the infliction of terror and damage upon the group through the brutality of rape . In Bangladesh though , the systemic use of rape in the liberation war was also a means to produce children fathered by West Pakistani army men in an attempt to wipe out Bengali nationhood . Institutionalised rape in the Bangladesh liberation war Best of Express Premium In March 1971 when the issue of cultural and linguistic identity in East Pakistan had come to a boil , president Yahya Khan gave out public orders for the Bengalis to be made into \u201c true Muslims \u201d . Though there is absence of any official documents , reports suggest that the orders given out by Yahya Khan and General Tikka Khan were to impregnate Muslim women in East Pakistan who were supporters of Bangladesh 's formation and Hindu women with the intention of building a \u201c pure Pakistan . \u201d The result was devastating and traumatic . The army left no stone unturned to carry out the orders of the Pakistani government . Women were hunted down , picked up from their homes , schools , streets and even their bedrooms and raped barbarously . An official estimate of 200,000 to 400,000 women were raped by the Pakistani military and the supporting Bihari and Bengali Razakar and al - Badr militias . Describing a case of assault on a newly married woman , writer Aubrey Menen says the following : \u201c Two [ Pakistani soldiers ] went into the room that had been built for the bridal couple . The others stayed behind with the family , one of them covering them with his gun . They heard a barked order , and the bridegroom 's voice protesting . Then there was silence until the bride screamed . Then there was silence again , except for some muffled cries that soon subsided . In a few minutes one of the soldiers came out , his uniform in disarray . He grinned to his companions . Another soldier took his place in the extra room . And so on , until all the six had raped the belle of the village . Then all six left , hurriedly . The father found his daughter lying on the string cot unconscious and bleeding . Her husband was crouched on the floor , kneeling over his vomit . \u201c Several women were forced to live in rape camps where there were raped repeatedly . Journalist Susan Brownmiller wrote in her work that there were some women who had been raped nearly 80 times in one night . The plight of the women did not just end there . Once the war was over and Bangladesh took birth , these women were ostracised , seen as a black mark upon societal honour . The Bangladesh government did try to incorporate them in their society . The new president , Mujibur Rehman , referred to the survivors of war rape as birangonas ( war heroines ) and urged their families and society in general to accept them . However , the reality of the situation for these women was very different . War babies The situation was much graver for those who were direct products of this atrocious war - the children of war . Official estimates suggest that close to 25,000 babies were born from the genocidal attack on women . While the newly formed Bangladeshi government was sympathetic towards the grievances of the raped women , they were absolutely merciless towards the children born of the raped women . Mujibur Rehman is reported to have announced that \u201c none of the babies who carry the blood of the Pakistanis will be allowed to remain in Bangladesh . \u201d Speaking to a feminist author , he had said that he did not want to keep \u201c those polluted blood \u201d in his country . The stigma attached to war babies resulted in widespread confusion regarding what to do with them . Several international organisations were asked to help carry out late abortions of pregnant women and assisting in adoption of children by families abroad . Nearly 5000 women though had aborted their ' unwanted ' babies through unsafe methods . There were others who did not want to undergo abortions and pleaded with the government to let them be . There are several war babies currently in Bangladesh , conscious of their identity and the history attached to their birth as also the price they paid for the birth of their country . War rapes in present times The Bangladesh war of 1971 was hardly the last time rape was used as a tool for inflicting terror and brutality upon the enemy in the event of a war . Even today , despite the creation of modern democratic societies , women continue to be the most vulnerable targets of wartime attacks . In the recent past similar technique of assault was implemented particularly by the Islamic State in the Middle East and the Burmese army upon the Rohingyas . As of 2014 , close to 1,500 Yazidi and Christian women had been forced into sexual slavery by the Islamic State . The rationale in each of these cases remains the use of sexual assault as a means of disciplining the victims and making them subservient to the rule of the assaulter . This apart , women being seen as the honour of a society in a patriarchal set up , the use of rape becomes a means to wound the pride of the men and the community . Whatever be the reasoning , what continues to remain true for thousands of years now is that women in conflict zones do not just get victimised by the enemy but also by the community which they supposedly represent .

Last week , the region 's prospects appeared in the doldrums and there was little chance of a reversal of fortunes soon . Take a step back though and there is hope to be had . EU membership talks involving Montenegro and Serbia , the two frontrunners , have been stuck for almost a year , with the last negotiating chapters opened in December 2018 . EU leaders could not agree at the October summit to open accession talks with Albania and North Macedonia and the latter 's prime minister , Zoran Zaev , then called a snap election for the spring . But fast - forward a few days , and things suddenly look up .

But at the same time , it is trying to attract a \u20ac 1.4 billion investment from Volkswagen . As for Zaev , what looked like a desperate , emotional protest of a man let down by the EU , could well have been a well - calculated gamble that may pay dividends in the end , rather than bring back nationalists to power . Here is why . North Macedonia is all but certain to join NATO in December or January . The alliance has already publicly reassured the country its accession would go ahead . So chalk one up for Zaev . France , the staunchest opponent of enlargement , holds municipal elections on 15 March . After that , there will be much less need to play up its resistance to \u201c quick enlargement \u201d for domestic audiences and Emmanuel Macron could be easier to sway . The European Council meets on 26 - 27 March and enlargement will be on the agenda again , before a major EU - Western Balkan summit planned in Zagreb in May .

Incidentally , Lonely Planet has just named North Macedonia the third - best place to visit in 2020 , calling it a \u201c little - known gem \u201d . As for the other five countries , the Zagreb summit should open the EU door a wee bit wider , or at least give them a clearer road - map and perspective . But then again , things could also take a nastier turn in the Balkans .

As more details of his predatory activities came to light , several leading universities and respected figures were struggling to contain the backlash . It saw one prominent laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the firing line with its director apologising and pledging to return the money paid by Epstein . Another Harvard academic has apologised for meeting with Epstein after the billionaire 's Florida conviction on child prostitution charges . More scientists are likely to find themselves under the microscope over the next few weeks as critics demand to know how much Epstein 's beneficiaries knew of his activities , including his interest in eugenics and plans to \u201c improve \u201d the human race by impregnating 20 women at a time . Scientists faced a dilemma , said Kathleen Hall Jamieson , professor of communication and the director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania . \u201c Scientists need funding for important work and many forms of it are underfunded . \u201d \u201c If the funding is for legitimate scientific work , there is nothing wrong with accepting support from a billionaire . \u201d \" However it would have been wrong for scientists to accept his funding if they were aware that he was planning a eugenics experiment that might draw legitimacy from his association with them . Epstein reportedly had plans to do things which were highly problematic , such as creating generations of himself . \u201d And if scientists were aware that Epstein was engaged in criminal forms of exploitation , \" they were legally and ethically required to report him . \" Epstein was a generous benefactor to scientific institutions for many years , in particular , Harvard . Despite never having completed a college degree , Epstein prided himself on his association with the university , even being pictured wearing a Harvard sweatshirt . The vehicle for many of the donations was the Jeffrey Epstein Vl Foundation , which was established in 2000 with the mission to \u201c support cutting edge science and science education around the world \u201d . According to the Foundation 's website , its donations included a $ 35 million gift in 2003 to establish the Programme for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard . Other sources suggest the figure was a more modest $ 6.5 million . He wined and dined some of the world 's most eminent scientists , including Stephen Hawking and George Church , a geneticist at Harvard . Prof. Church has issued a public apology for meeting Epstein when he completed his 13 - month sentence after pleading guilty to charges of soliciting and procuring a person under 18 for prostitution . In an interview with STAT , a health and science website , he admitted that he had shown poor judgement . \u201c There should have been more conversations about , should we be doing this , should we be helping this guy ? There was just a lot of nerd tunnel vision . \u201d The controversy has caused considerable damage to the reputation of the Media Lab at MIT whose achievements include developing robotic prosthetics capable of imitating the human gait has been badly hit by the scandal . The donations received by MIT were modest compared with Harvard . One estimate suggests that the figure was \u201c in excess of $ 200,000 \u201d . Joi Ito , its director , issued a public apology admitting he had both allowed the Lab to accept money and allowed Epstein to invest in his personal fund for tech start - up companies . \u201c I was never involved in , never heard him talk about , and never saw any evidence of the horrific acts that he was accused of , \u201d he wrote . \u201c That said , I take full responsibility for my error in judgment . I am deeply sorry to the survivors , to the Media Lab , and to the MIT community for bringing such a person into our network . \u201d He has promised to return the money as well as raising an equivalent amount which he will direct towards supporting the victims of trafficking .

Their tunnel boring machine ( TBM # 1 ) will dig its way from the University District Station to University of Washington Station during the summer , completing the twin bore tunnel segment along the corridor . That means that TBM # 1 will have dug four of the six tunnel segments from the Maple Leaf Portal to University of Washington Station , which roughly equates to 4.5 miles of tunneling ( the corridor itself is 3.5 miles ) . TBM # 1 is the same tunnel boring machine that made the first lap from University District Station to University of Washington , reaching the station on March 30th . Its companion tunnel boring machine was unfortunately damaged in December while digging from Roosevelt Station to University District Station , leading to the TBM to shut down completely for more than a month for in - tunnel repairs . The shutdown left TBM # 2 an agonizing 650 feet from the University District station box . But by late March , TBM # 2 made it to the University District itself . Sound Transit 's contractor then assessed whether to relaunch the TBM or swap it out . JCM determined that the best solution was to remove TBM # 2 and instead transport TBM # 1 to University District Station , and then reassemble and refurbish it for relaunch . If TBM # 1 's last lap is anything to go by , transit enthusiasts can expect approximately 84 days of digging before the TBM reaches University of Washington Station . Or put another way , look toward the week of September 12th for breakthrough ( barring any calamities ) .

What bugs me the most is that annoying virtual CD - ROM drive that pops out every time I put my stick in my USB connector . The idea is that average user has all of its modem drivers ( of course Windows only ) nearby . What 's the use for that thing on our beloved Linux boxes ? I know one . We can have fun disabling this annoyance once and for all . In this article I 'll show you how to use your your Linux PC to disable virtual CD- ROM drive with built in software on Huawei and ZTE GSM modem devices . Disclamer : In this article you are going to send direct AT commands to your modem hardware and if you try real hard you can mess your hardware to the point where you will be unable to use it to connect to Internet . I 've tested following procedure with my Huawei E220 and ZTE MF100 devices but it should work for all Huawei and ZTE hardware . I know that you will probably proceed because that 's what every Linux geek ( my self included ) would do in your place but you 've been warned . So let 's cut to the chase . In this article I 'm using Ubuntu Linux 10.04 but the logic is the same for any Linux distribution . We will use minicom to communicate with our modem so let 's install it first ; sudo apt - get install minicom Now lets configure minicom for our modem device and select \" Serial port setup \" from the \" Configuration \" menu : sudo minicom -s For \" Serial Device \" you will select / dev/tty USB0 if you have Huawei E220 device or / dev/tty USB2 if you have ZTE MF100 modem device . If you have some other modem device for the \" tty USBX \" part take a look at the \" Connection information \" window from your Network Manager when you have established Internet connection . That will give you serial device location for your hardware . Here are the screen shots for my Huawei E220 : After you 've finished just select \" Save setup as dfl \" option and \" Exit from Minicom \" what will bring you back to terminal . Now you should be able to communicate directly with your modem using AT commands . Keep in mind that Network Manager locks your modem device as soon as you establish Internet connection using this device . It stays locked even after you disconnect so to be on the safe side now is the time to right click to your Network Manager and uncheck \" Enable Mobile Broadband \" or even \" Enable Networking \" option to release your device for use with minicom . Now run minicom using : sudo minicom If everything is correct you will be presented with the following screen : Huawei modem devices Now comes the most important part , AT commands to disable virtual CD- ROM drive . If you have Huawei device other than E220 you should consult the table bellow before entering any AT commands . If your device is Huawei E220 you can simply do the following : AT^U2DIAG=0 Here 's the more detailed table for more settings you can use instead of \" 0 \" .

The \u201c Stella \u201d was bound for the Channel Islands on a holiday trip , And a number of passengers were resolved not to let the chance slip ; And the hearts of the passengers felt light and gay , As the \u201c Stella \u201d steamed out of the London Docks without delay . The vessel left London at a quarter - past eleven , With a full passenger list and a favourable wind from heaven ; And all went well until late in the afternoon , When all at once a mist arose , alas ! too soon . And as the Channel Islands were approached a fog set in , Then the passengers began to be afraid and made a chattering din ; And about half - past three o'clock the fog settled down , Which caused Captain Reeks and the passengers with fear to frown . And brave Captain Reeks felt rather nervous and discontent , Because to him it soon became quite evident ; And from his long experience he plainly did see That the fog was increasing in great density . Still the \u201c Stella \u201d sailed on at a very rapid rate , And , oh , heaven ! rushed headlong on to her fate , And passed o'er the jagged rocks without delay , And her side was ripped open : Oh ! horror and dismay ! Then all the passengers felt the terrible shock , As the \u201c Stella \u201d stuck fast upon the first ledge of rock ; And they rushed to the deck in wild alarm , While some of them cried : \u201c Oh ! God protect us from harm . \u201d Then men clasped wives and daughters , and friends shook hands , And unmoved Captain Reeks upon the bridge stands ; And he shouted , \u201c Get out the boats without delay ! \u201d Then the sailors and officers began to work without dismay . Again Captain Reeks cried in a manly clear voice , \u201c Let the women and children be our first choice ! \u201d Then the boats were loaded in a speedy way , And with brave seamen to navigate them that felt no dismay . Then the \u201c Stella \u201d began rapidly for to settle down , And Captain Reeks gave his last order without a frown , Shouting , \u201c Men , for yourselves , you 'll better look out ! \u201d Which they did , needing no second bidding , without fear or doubt . Then the male passengers rushed to the boats in wild despair , While the cries of the women and children rent the air ; Oh , heaven ! such a scene ! ' twas enough to make one weep , To see mothers trying to save their children that were fast asleep . Brave Captain Reeks stood on the bridge till the ship went down , With his eyes uplifted towards heaven , and on his face no frown ; And some of the passengers jumped from the ship into the sea , And tried hard to save their lives right manfully . But the sufferings of the survivors are pitiful to hear , And I think all Christian people for them will drop a tear , Because the rowers of the boata were exhausted with damp and cold ; And the heroine of the wreck was Miss Greta Williams , be it told . She remained in as open boat with her fellow - passengers and crew , And sang \u201c O rest in the Lord , and He will come to our rescue \u201d ; And for fourteen hours they were rowing on the mighty deep , And when each man was done with his turn he fell asleep . And about six o'clock in the morning a man shrieked out , \u201c There 's a sailing boat coming towards us without any doubt \u201d ; And before the sailing boat could get near , a steamer hove in sight , Which proved to be the steamer \u201c Lynx , \u201d to their delight . And they were conveyed to Guernsey without delay , Poor souls , with their hearts in a state of joy and dismay ; But alas ! more than eighty persons have been lost in the briny deep , But I hope their souls are now in heaven in safe keep . Disaster in the Channel Passenger Steamer Wrecked Great Loss of Life It is with the deepest regret that we announce that a terrible disaster has overtaken the London and South -Western Railway Company 's passenger steamer Stella , engaged in the Southampton and Channel Islands service . During a dense fog on Thursday afternoon she ran on the Casquets , and foundered in 12 or 15 minutes . The exact loss of life is not yet known , but it is feared that the list of victims of this calamity may reach a hundred . The Stella was one of three steel twin-screw steamers built for the London and South - Western Company by Messrs . J. and G. Thomson ( Limited ) , of Glasgow , and delivered in 1890 , the companion ships being the Lydia and the Frederica . The design of all three was substantially the same , the gross register of each being 1,059 tons , and the principal dimensions as follows :- Length , 250.0 ft . ; breadth , 35.1 ft . ; depth , 14.8 ft . All were lighted throughout by electricity , and complied with the Board of Trade requirements as to life - saving appliances . In each case triple expansion engines were fitted , the average speed attained in service being 18 knots , and the three steamers have been extremely popular , the masters and officers being men who have had long acquaintance with the navigation of the English Channel . Although the precise number cannot at present be stated \u2014 owing to the fact that it is not the practice to book the names of passengers on such short services \u2014 it is believed that the Stella was carrying about 140 persons to the Channel Islands , the journey being the first daylight trip of the season . Captain Reeks , a skilled and trusted seaman , was in charge , and the crew numbered 40 all told . The steamer left Southampton at 11:45 on Thursday morning , no fewer than 110 of the passengers having travelled from Waterloo the same morning by special train . Fog was encountered in the Channel , and it increased to such an extent that , although the fog-horn attached to the lighthouse on the Casquets could be heard , the rocks were invisible . Speed was not , however reduced . The Casquets , well known to all travellers to the Channel Islands , form an isolated group of rocks which rise abruptly from the water , and constitute the mariner 's last warning mark on the journey from Guernsey to England , being situate about eight miles W. of Alderney and 23 miles N.E. of Guernsey . The highest point of the group is surmounted by a powerful flashing light visible in favourable weather 15 miles . At four o'clock in the afternoon , when it was supposed by the navigating officer that the Casquets were about eight miles to the east , the Casquets suddenly loomed out of the darkness , and immediately afterwards the Stella struck the rock amidships . No panic ensued , but the master saw that the steamer had run upon one of the sharp ridges of the shoal , and was fast sinking . He ordered the five lifeboats which hung suspended from the davits and the two Berthon collapsible boats secured on the shade deck to be got ready and launched with all possible speed . The instruction was promptly obeyed by the crew , but the Berthon boats took a little longer to get out than the others . Women and children were first put into the boats , Mr. Wade , the chief officer , seeing that the captain 's orders were carried out , the male passengers and crew following , Captain Reeks remaining all the time at his post on the bridge . The sea was calm , but there was , as usual , a big swirl on the rocks . It was impossible for all on board to leave the vessel before she slipped off the rock , and sank stern foremost in deep water , her boilers at the same moment exploding with terrific force . One of the survivors , who got away in the dinghy , states that from the moment of striking to the disappearance of the Stella barely ten minutes had elapsed , and none of the survivors puts the time at more than 15 minutes . The suction produced by the sinking ship was very great , and the crew of the dinghy momentarily feared that their craft would be engulfed . Five of the boats were soon lost to sight in the fog , but the sixth , filled with ladies , was taken in tow by the dinghy , the occupants of which used the oars in turn . They rowed on all night until most of them dropped asleep from exhaustion . A second boat , which was in charge of the chief officer , capsized , and almost all its occupants were drowned . A few , however , were picked up by the other boats , which were then laden to the water 's edge . Between five and six o'clock yesterday morning the Great Western Railway Company 's steamer , Lynx , on her journey from Weymouth to Guernsey , came upon the scene , and rendered assistance . She stopped and picked up two boat-loads of passengers , 35 in all , and conveyed them to Guernsey . Owing to the fog the incoming Great Western boat from Weymouth , due at St. Heliers , Jersey , at 8 o'clock on Thursday evening , did not arrive at that port until 1 o'clock yesterday morning . She , however , had heard nothing of the , disaster . The Dora , another South - Western packet , arrived at Jersey direct from Southampton about noon yesterday and reported having passed two other boats which had contained 35 passengers and nine of the crew . In addition to the South - Western Company 's steamer Honfleur , various Alderney boats received orders to proceed to the neighbourhood of the wreck . The South - Western Railway Company 's new steamer Vera , which left Southampton on Thursday at midnight , arrived at Guernsey at 9 o'clock yesterday morning with 40 more survivors , including 20 ladies , whom she had picked up near the scene of the wreck . In addition to those landed at Guernsey , some of the rescued were taken on to Jersey by other vessels , but it is calculated that not many more than 100 have been saved out of double that number on board . The disaster created the greatest excitement and consternation in the Channel Islands and in Southampton . Many Guernsey families have lost one or more of their members , and the South - Western Railway offices were yesterday besieged by anxious relatives and friends of those aboard the illfated steamer . Flags were at half - mast in St. Peter Port . The Honfleur last night returned to Guernsey from a search at the scene of the -wreck . The captain stated that the Stella must have sunk in 13 fathoms . He says he signalled the Casquets lighthouse \u2014 \u201d Have you seen or heard of a vessel wrecked ? \u201d and the reply came \u201c Yesterday afternoon heard steamer . \u201d The captain replied : \u2014 \u201c I shall stay about and see if I can pick up anything from wreck . \u201d The captain then made a complete circle of the Casquets , picking up several life belts , and two boats containing ladies ' wearing apparel , handbags , money , jewelry , opera glasses and case , the latter having been used for baling purposes . Mr. Spencer , the Guernsey manager of the South -Western Company , telegraphed early yesterday morning to Alderney requesting a boat to be sent to search for any survivors . This boat afterwards returned with nothing to report . Some very pathetic incidents are reported in connexion with the wreck . A lady . who had ; come over from Southampton with her husband and child to visit her father states that she and the child were pressed into a boat by the husband , who refused her entreaty to be allowed to stay with him , begging her to go for the sake of the children . He remained behind and . perished . The bereaved woman expresses her surprise and admiration at the calmness an courage displayed by every one on board . She noticed a lady friend of hers gathering up luggage and a little boy arranging his toys . These both perished immediately afterwards . Another lady has lost her husband and her only child , the husband having pressed her into a full boat , just missing it himself . Among the missing is a sister of one of the most popular clergymen on the island . One lady who lost her husband and child is reported to have since lost her reason and is driving about the island looking for the missing ones . Apparently every effort was made to save life , belts being distributed broadcast . The Times , 1st April 1899 Further Reading - S.S.

The problem , heretofore , with sunflower seeds was the difficulty of dehulling them at home , and the lack of a device for expressing oil from the seeds . About six months ago , we decided to change all that . The job was to find out who makes a sunflower seed dehuller or to devise one if none were manufactured . And to either locate a home - scale oilseed press or devise one . No mean task . Our researches took us from North Dakota -- hub of commercial sunflower activity in the nation -- to a search of the files in the U.S. Patent Office , with stops in between . We turned up a lot of big machinery , discovered how difficult it is to buy really pure , unrefined vegetable oils , but found no small - scale equipment to dehull sunflowers or press out their oil . The key to success , however , was on our desk the whole time . In spring 1977 , August Kormier had submitted a free - lance article describing how he used a Corona grain mill to dehull his sunflower seeds , and his vacuum cleaner exhaust hose to blow the hulls off the kernels . A second separation floated off the remaining hulls , leaving a clean product . We 'd tried it , but because some kernels were cracked and the process involved drying , we had n't been satisfied . Now we felt the best approach was to begin again with what we learned from Mr. Kormier and refine it . The key to success , however , was on our desk the whole time .

A second separation floated off the remaining hulls , leaving a clean product . We 'd tried it , but because some kernels were cracked and the process involved drying , we had n't been satisfied . Now we felt the best approach was to begin again with what we learned from Mr. Kormier and refine it . A pound of oilseed produced just under three ounces of oil . Staff Editor Diana Branch and Home Workplace Editor Jim Eldon worked with a number of hand - and electric- powered grain mills . While the Corona did a passable job , they got the best results with the C.S. Bell # 60 hand mill and the Marathon Uni Mill , which is motor-driven . \" I could n't believe my eyes the first time I tried the Marathon , \" Diana says . \" I opened the stones to 1/8th inch , and out came a bin full of whole kernels and hulls split right at the seams . What a thrill that was ! \" She found that by starting at the widest setting , and gradually narrowing the opening , almost every seed was dehulled . The stones crack the hulls open , then rub them to encourage the seed away from the fibrous lining . The Bell hand mill worked almost as well . \" As long as the stones open at least as wide as the widest unhulled seed , any mill will work , \" she says . Because the seed slips through the mill on its flat side , grading is an important step to take before dehulling . We made three sizing boxes . The first is 1/4-inch hardware cloth [ wire screen ] . The second is two layers of 1/4-inch cloth , moved slightly apart to narrow the opening in one direction , and the third is two layers of screen adjusted to make a still- smaller opening . Since the smallest unhulled seeds are about the size of the largest hulled kernels , the grading step prevents these undersized seeds from passing through unhulled . Processed together at a closer setting , the smallest seeds hulled out . A hardware cloth grader sizes the kernels for better hulling . Two layers of cloth , spaced slightly apart , narrow the hole for a second grading . The more grading , the better the hulling . Jim Eldon 's workshop is littered with strange - looking pieces of apparatus . They represent initial attempts to build a workable winnowing box , using Kormier 's vacuum exhaust idea for a source of air . Jim , Fred Matlack and Diana finally made a box with a Plexiglas front , through which they could observe what was happening . They cut a hole in the back of the box with a sliding cover to regulate the air pressure , and fiddled with various arrangements of baffles . The result was a stream of hulls exiting through one hole while the kernels fell to the bottom of the box . Now they were ready to try a five - pound sample of unhulled sunflower seeds to see how much they could recover . The five pounds were graded and dehulled , then winnowed . We got about one hull for every ten kernels in the final , winnowed product . These are easily picked out . They usually contain kernels still held behind the fibrous strings of the hull . Their weight prevents them from blowing out with the empty hulls . We found that bug -eaten seeds do blow away with the chaff , which was a bonus for cleanliness of the final product . Toss the hulls to the birds , who will find broken seeds among them . Starting with 80 ounces of unhulled seed , we ended up with 41 - 1/4 ounces of edible whole seeds , 1.8 ounces of damaged seeds suitable for animal feed , and 36.6 ounces of hulls . It took us about an hour . Not bad . Sunflower seeds store perfectly in the hulls , but they deteriorate more rapidly when shelled out . The grain mill dehuller and winnowing box give the gardener a way to have the freshest possible seeds for eating at all times of the year . With the construction of one more piece of equipment -- the oil press -- he can have absolutely fresh , unrefined , polyunsaturated sunflower oil for salads , mayonnaise and cooking . Most light , refined vegetable oils have been extracted using hexane , a form of naphtha . The oil is then heated to boil off the hexane . Lye is dumped into it . It 's washed with steam , then heated to remove odors and taste before being laced with preservatives and stabilizers . It may feel oily in the mouth , but you might as well taste air . No so with fresh - made sunflower oil -- it 's deliciously yet subtly nutty in flavor , adding unsurpassed flavor to salads .

No so with fresh - made sunflower oil -- it 's deliciously yet subtly nutty in flavor , adding unsurpassed flavor to salads . A little heat and the oil pours out of the pistonlike cylinder , then to be strained with a paint filter . There 's good reason to believe that sunflower oil may become the # 1 vegetable oil in the U.S. in a few years . It 's already # 1 in health - conscious Europe . Corn oil has already caught on here for health reasons , and sunflower oil is so much better . Sunflower oil 's 70 percent polyunsaturate is just under safflower , with corn oil bringing up the rear with 55 percent . And sunflowers yield 40 percent oil , soybeans only 20 percent . Our oil press is relatively simple , but it must be welded together . Check the construction directions for details . The press consists of a welded tubular frame which accepts a three - ton hydraulic jack . You may already have one . If not , it can be purchased at most auto and hardware stores for about $ 16 . A metal canister with holes drilled in its sides and one end welded shut holds the mashed sunflower seeds . A piston is inserted in the canister and then inverted and slipped over a pedestal on the frame . The jack is set in place , and the pressure gradually increased over half an hour . The oil drips from the sides of the canister into a tray -- the bottom of a plastic jug slipped over the pedestal works fine -- which empties the oil into a cup . You can filter the oil with a coffee filter to remove pieces of seed and other fine particles that would burn if the oil were used for cooking . If it 's for salads or mayonnaise , there 's no need to filter it . We first tried using \" confectionary \" sunflower seeds for oil . These are the regular eating kernels we 're used to seeing . They give less than half as much oil as the oilseed types of sunflower . Although you can use confectionary types such as MAMMOTH RUS - SIAN for oil , do n't expect to get more than an ounce and a half from a pound of seed . Oilseed produces three or more ounces of oil from a pound of seed and is well worth planting along with confectionary - type seeds . Oilseed has another big advantage -- to prepare it , you can put the whole , unhulled seed into a blender and whiz it until it forms a fine meal , while confectionary seeds must be dehulled first . The entire sequence of grading , dehulling and winnowing is avoided with oilseed . We first tried using \" confectionary \" sunflower seeds for oil .

The entire sequence of grading , dehulling and winnowing is avoided with oilseed . Two kinds of sunflower seeds -- oilseeds on the left , confectionary on the right . Oil types produce about a tenth of a pound of seed per head in commercial production . Gardeners , with their better soil and care , invariably do better than that . Our conservative estimate is that 1,280 plants will be enough for three gallons of oil . Spaced one foot apart in rows two feet apart , 1,280 oilseed plants will take a space 40 - by - 56 feet , or 80 - by - 28 if you want a more rectangular patch to face south . We worked in pound batches , since the canister just holds one pound of mash . After blending , we heated it to 170 degrees F. ( 77 deg C ) by placing it in a 300 - degree F. ( 149 deg C ) oven and stirring it every five minutes for 20 minutes . Heating gets the oil flowing and doubles the yield of oil . In case you 're wondering , \" cold - pressed \" oils sold commercially are also heated , and some are subjected to the entire chemical process . The term has no firm meaning within the industry , according to the literature we 've surveyed . Heating does not change the structure of fats . It will not turn polyunsaturated fats into saturated fats . In fact , Dr. Donald R. Germann in his book , \" The Anti-Cancer Diet \" , says that \" ... an unsaturated fat must be heated to high temperatures -- above 425 degrees F. or 200 degrees C. -- at least 8 or 10 times before any shift toward saturation occurs ... \" Dean C. Fletcher , Ph.D. , of the American Medical Association Department of Foods and Nutrition in Chicago , says , \" It 's true that either high temperature or repeated heating does change the nature of some of the unsaturated oil molecules . ( But ) the flavor of the oil changes as these chemical changes occur , spoiling its taste . This effect is probably more profound than any of the physiological changes the altered oil might produce within the body . \" From 500 gm. of heated mash , we pressed 89 gm . of oil , 89 percent of the entire amount available and twice as much as we could press from unheated oil ! The decision is up to you whether or not to heat the mash , but that extra 50 percent seems like an awful lot , especially when the whole technique is so labor intensive . The oil should be stored in the refrigerator , and it 's probably best to use it within a month , since it has no preservatives . Mayonnaise made with such fresh oils should be kept refrigerated and used within two weeks . The leftover cake , still containing 50 percent of its oil , is a nutritious addition to your dishes , and makes excellent feed for animals or winter birds . Store the pressed cake in the freezer . We 're talking then about a sunflower patch with two kinds of plants -- confectionary such as MAMMOTH RUSSIAN and oilseed such as PEREDOVIK . The oilseed plants should be grown 12 inches apart in rows two feet apart . Four average confectionary heads yield about a pound of unhulled seed . You 'll need about 35 pounds of unhulled seed , or 140 plants - worth , to yield 20 pounds of hulled kernels , about what a family of four will use in a year . That many plants can be grown in an area 26 - by - 10 feet . That 's 260 square feet . Put that together with the 2,240 square feet for the oilseed sunflowers , and you need a patch about 2,500 square feet -- 25 100 - foot rows -- to keep yourself supplied year - round with super nutrition and unsurpassable taste . The winnowing machine operates on the age - old principle of blowing the chaff away from the heavy grain with a controlled current of air . The unit uses a household or shop- type vacuum cleaner for its air supply . A vacuum cleaner was used as a power source because it can supply a large volume of air over an extended period of time , and most homes and farms have a vacuum cleaner . A cloth bag has been attached to the chaff chute to catch the chaff as it is separated from the seed . The bag allows the hulls to be collected and greatly reduces the amount of waste material normally blown into the air by conventional systems . The unit has been constructed in such a way that the cloth bag and cleaner box can be placed inside the seed box , making a compact package for storage . Tools Required 1 . Table Saw 2 .

The press was designed so that homesteaders can produce sunflower oil from their own seeds . The oil can be pressed as is or heated to 170 degrees F. , which doubles oil yield . Both methods require the seed to be ground to fine powder . If you are pressing the oil seed variety , a meat grinder or electric blender will do an excellent job of grinding the seed . The confectionary type of seed will require the seed to be hulled and winnowed before it is ground . A food mill with the stones set at the coarse setting can be used to accomplish this step . The ground kernels are placed in the cylinder with the piston closing the bottom portion of the cylinder . The cylinder is mounted in the press frame and a three - ton hydraulic jack is used to supply the pressure . Because of the great pressures created by the hydraulic jack , it is important that the frame be properly constructed and firmly mounted to the work surface before the pressing operation begins .

The solution , whose simplicity has stunned mathematicians , is already leading to advances in other combinatorics problems . Invented in 1974 , Set has a simple goal : to find special triples called \u201c sets \u201d within a deck of 81 cards . Each card displays a different design with four attributes \u2014 color ( which can be red , purple or green ) , shape ( oval , diamond or squiggle ) , shading ( solid , striped or outlined ) and number ( one , two or three copies of the shape ) . In typical play , 12 cards are placed face - up and the players search for a set : three cards whose designs , for each attribute , are either all the same or all different . Occasionally , there 's no set to be found among the 12 cards , so the players add three more cards . Even less frequently , there 's still no set to be found among the 15 cards . How big , one might wonder , is the largest collection of cards that contains no set ? The answer is 20 \u2014 proved in 1971 by the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Pellegrino . But for mathematicians , this answer was just the beginning . After all , there 's nothing special about having designs with only four attributes \u2014 that choice simply creates a manageable deck size . It 's easy to imagine cards with more attributes ( for instance , they could have additional images , or even play different sounds or have scratch - and - sniff smells ) . For every whole number n , there 's a version of Set with n attributes and 3n different cards . For each such version , we can consider collections of cards that contain no set \u2014 what mathematicians confusingly call \u201c cap sets \u201d \u2014 and ask how large they can be . Mathematicians have calculated the maximal size of cap sets for games with up to six attributes , but we 'll probably never know the exact size of the largest cap set for a game with 100 or 200 attributes , said Jordan Ellenberg , a mathematician at the University of Wisconsin , Madison \u2014 there are so many different collections of cards to consider that the computations are too mammoth ever to be carried out . Yet mathematicians can still try to figure out an upper bound on how big a cap set can be \u2014 a number of cards guaranteed to hold at least one set . This question is one of the simplest problems in the mathematical field called Ramsey theory , which studies how large a collection of objects can grow before patterns emerge . \u201c The cap set problem we think of as a model problem for all these other questions in Ramsey theory , \u201d said Terence Tao , a mathematician at the University of California , Los Angeles , and a winner of the Fields Medal , one of mathematics ' highest honors . \u201c It was always believed that progress would come there first , and then once we 'd sorted that out we would be able to make progress elsewhere . \u201d Yet until now , this progress has been slow . Mathematicians established in papers published in 1995 and 2012 that cap sets must be smaller than about 1/n the size of the full deck . Many mathematicians wondered , however , whether the true bound on cap set size might be much smaller than that . They were right to wonder . The new papers posted online this month showed that relative to the size of the deck , cap set size shrinks exponentially as n gets larger . In a game with 200 attributes , for instance , the previous best result limited cap set size to at most about 0.5 percent of the deck ; the new bound shows that cap sets are smaller than 0.0000043 percent of the deck . The previous results were \u201c already considered to be quite a big breakthrough , but this completely smashes the bounds that they achieved , \u201d said Timothy Gowers , a mathematician and Fields medalist at the University of Cambridge . There 's still room to improve the bound on cap sets , but in the near term , at least , any further progress is likely to be incremental , Gowers said . \u201c In a certain sense this completely finishes the problem . \u201d Game , Set , Match To find an upper bound on the size of cap sets , mathematicians translate the game into geometry . For the traditional Set game , each card can be encoded as a point with four coordinates , where each coordinate can take one of three values ( traditionally written as 0 , 1 and 2 ) . For instance , the card with two striped red ovals might correspond to the point ( 0 , 2 , 1 , 0 ) , where the 0 in the first spot tells us that the design is red , the 2 in the second spot tells us that the shape is oval , and so on . There are similar encodings for versions of Set with n attributes , in which the points have n coordinates instead of four . The rules of the Set game translate neatly into the geometry of the resulting n-dimensional space : Every line in the space contains exactly three points , and three points form a set precisely when they lie on the same line . A cap set , therefore , is a collection of points that contains no complete lines . Previous approaches to getting an upper bound on cap set size used a technique called Fourier analysis , which views the collection of points in a cap set as a combination of waves and looks for the directions in which the collection oscillates . \u201c The conventional wisdom was that this was the way to go , \u201d Tao said . Now , however , mathematicians have solved the cap set problem using an entirely different method \u2014 and in only a few pages of fairly elementary mathematics . \u201c One of the delightful aspects of the whole story to me is that I could just sit down , and in half an hour I had understood the proof , \u201d Gowers said . The proof uses the \u201c polynomial method , \u201d an innovation that , despite its simplicity , only rose to prominence on the mathematical scene about a decade ago . The approach produces \u201c beautiful short proofs , \u201d Tao said . It 's \u201c sort of magical . \u201d A polynomial is a mathematical expression built out of numbers and variables raised to powers \u2014 for instance , x2 + y2 or 3xy z3 + 2 . Given any collection of numbers , it 's possible to create a polynomial that evaluates to zero at all those numbers \u2014 for example , if you pick the numbers 2 and 3 , you can build the expression ( x \u2013 2 ) ( x \u2013 3 ) ; this multiplies out to the polynomial x2 \u2013 5 x + 6 , which equals zero if x = 2 or x = 3 . Something similar can be done to create polynomials that evaluate to zero at a collection of points \u2014 for instance , the points corresponding to Set cards . At first glance , this does n't seem like a very deep fact . Yet somehow , these polynomials often seem to contain information that is n't readily visible from the set of points . Mathematicians do n't fully understand , Ellenberg said , just why this approach works so well , and which types of problems it can be useful for . Until a few weeks ago , he added , he considered cap set \u201c an example of a problem where the polynomial method really has no purchase . \u201d That changed on May 5 , when three mathematicians \u2014 Ernie Croot of the Georgia Institute of Technology , Vsevolod Lev of the University of Haifa , Oranim , in Israel , and P\u00e9ter P\u00e1l Pach of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in Hungary \u2014 posted a paper online showing how to use the polynomial method to solve a closely related problem , in which each Set attribute can have four different options instead of three . For technical reasons , this problem is more tractable than the original Set problem . In this game variant , for any collection of cards with no set , Croot , Lev and Pach considered which additional cards could be laid down on the table to complete a set . They then built a polynomial that evaluates to zero on these completion cards , and figured out an ingeniously simple way to split the polynomial into pieces with smaller exponents , which led to a bound on the size of collections with no sets . It was a \u201c very inventive move , \u201d Ellenberg said . \u201c It 's always incredibly cool when there 's something truly new and it 's easy . \u201d The paper soon set off a cascade of what Ellenberg called \u201c math at Internet speed . \u201d Within 10 days , Ellenberg and Dion Gijswijt , a mathematician at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands , had each independently posted papers showing how to modify the argument to polish off the original cap set problem in just three pages . Yesterday , they posted a joint paper combining their results . The trick , Ellenberg said , is to realize that there are many different polynomials that evaluate to zero on a given set of points , and that choosing just the right one gets \u201c a little bit more juice out of the method . \u201d A cap set , the new proofs establish , can be at most ( 2.756/3 ) n as large as the whole deck . Mathematicians are now scrambling to figure out the implications of the new proof . Already , a paper has been posted online showing that the proof rules out one of the approaches mathematicians were using to try to create more efficient matrix multiplication algorithms . And on May 17 , Gil Kalai , of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , wrote an \u201c emergency \u201d blog post pointing out that the cap set result can be used to prove the \u201c Erd\u0151s - Szemer\u00e9di sunflower conjecture , \u201d which concerns sets that overlap in a sunflower pattern . \u201c I think a lot of people will be thinking , ' What can I do with this ? ' \u201d Gowers said . Croot , Lev and Pach 's approach , he wrote in a blog post , is \u201c a major new technique to add to the toolbox . \u201d The fact that the cap set problem finally yielded to such a simple technique is humbling , Ellenberg said . \u201c It makes you wonder what else is actually easy . \u201d This article was reprinted on Wired.com ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Bill Leavy , former cop and firefighter , must have done a better job directing traffic and putting out whatever gameday fires were started by overzealous moms and dads during his days refereeing games in the San Jose PAL . But good luck finding anyone or anything that did n't stink in and around Super Bowl XL . Mike Holmgren stunk . Ben Roethlisberger stunk . Jerramy Stevens stunk . Mick Jagger stunk . The commercials stunk . So it stood to reason that the officiating crew would spend a largely forgettable evening in Detroit making that overturned Troy Polamalu interception in Indianapolis look like the call of the century .

It can turn him into Bob Waggoner , back judge , reaching awfully late into his pocket to wipe out a 7 - 0 Seahawks lead on a ticky - tack foul that should never get called in a high - stakes game . Was Waggoner influenced by the protesting Chris Hope ? By that raging yellow sea of Terrible Towels ? \" I 'm not in a position to comment at this time , unfortunately , \" Waggoner said Monday by phone . Only a fool would suggest that Waggoner , a Pittsburgh native , was scoring one for the home team . He was doing the best he could under pressure that ca n't be simulated by the three - hour psychological exam he passed to earn his NFL stripes . The pressure gets to the best of 'em . Holmgren lost track of the downs in his previous Super Bowl appearance , and ordered his defensive unit to let the Broncos score a late touchdown ( in order to get back the ball ) when he should 've ordered it to make a stand . This time around , Holmgren did a terrific job running out the clock at the close of the first and second halves despite the fact he was trailing at the time . How could a championship - caliber coach like Holmgren decline to kick a field goal in the game 's final seconds when his only chance amounted to a three - pointer , a recovered onside kick , a touchdown and a two -point conversion ? Good question , just like this one : How could the head of a Super Bowl crew tell the world that Matt Hasselbeck was guilty of an illegal block after he tackled the Steeler who had just intercepted his pass ? Like Holmgren , Leavy makes mistakes . Leavy and his crew made some big ones Sunday , all at Seattle 's expense . The lame holding call on Sean Locklear that negated a huge ( and rare ) Stevens catch might 've prevented Holmgren from becoming the first coach to win Super Bowls for different franchises . Then again , Holmgren might 've prevented Holmgren from becoming the first coach to win Super Bowls for different franchises , with an assist from Stevens , whose grip proved to be as loose as his lips . Leavy could 've helped matters earlier by overturning Roethlisberger 's non-touchdown . But once ABC showed that Leavy likes overturning calls as much as Polamalu likes trips to the barbershop , you knew the referee was n't really examining the replay anymore . He was actually studying a hidden - camera view of The Rolling Stones ' green room , looking for evidence of illegal motion .

So trowels flew after the British government \u2014 heeding environmental concerns \u2014 announced plans to gradually eliminate peat from all gardening products , setting off an intense battle over how to prioritize two of this country 's defining passions : indulging the yard and protecting the planet . A blog about energy and the environment . Andrew Testa for The New York Times While many gardeners regard the partially decomposed plant matter known as peat as an almost magical elixir , environmentalists say using it is problematic because it is scraped off the tops of centuries - old bogs , which are vital ecosystems that also serve as natural stores of carbon , just like rain forests . The celebrity gardener Bob Flowerdew was shocked by the violent reaction when he said he would defy the government and continue to use peat to nurture finicky plants like azaleas . \u201c The hate mail was quite frightening \u2014 in some circles I 've become an outcast , \u201d said Mr. Flowerdew , a longtime panelist on the BBC 's \u201c Gardeners ' Question Time \u201d radio program , and a favorite speaker at women 's clubs . The debate between the gardening industry and environmentalists grew so acerbic that the government appointed an emergency peat task force after the phaseout plan was announced last year , which delivered a first report this summer . \u201c What I 've done is to try to unblock an impasse \u2014 to find a sensible midpoint where everyone agrees , \u201d said Alan Knight , the task force chairman and an expert in sustainability . \u201c We needed a road map of how to get to zero peat . \u201d But some gardeners and gardening companies say they simply cannot do without peat , a spongy natural concoction of water , air and acidity , for nurturing certain seeds and plants . \u201c If you love your garden , you really ca n't just abstain , \u201d said Mr. Flowerdew , surrounded in his greenhouse by bags of peat-free alternatives he has tried . Behind this uniquely British drama is a serious global environmental issue , one largely ignored in the United States and most of Europe , where bagged soils with a high percentage of peat are widely used in potting and sprinkled willy - nilly on gardens and parks as compost or to condition soil . Peat use is already beginning to decrease in Britain , where horticulture is a billion - dollar business and companies are creating reduced - peat soils in response to the government 's call . But greater awareness is needed , experts say . \u201c People walk over peat lands , but they 're not aware of how important they are from a climate - change point of view , \u201d said Ian Crosher , a scientist with Natural England , which advises the government on the environment , and supports a ban . \u201c Peat bogs have far greater capacity to store CO2 than rain forests . Peat bogs are England 's rain forests . \u201d Disrupting a peat bog releases some of the emissions it holds . Bogs are also a precious natural habitat in Britain , favored by hikers and some threatened birds . Many British bogs are seriously degraded because they have been drained to take out gardening material or to make way for development . And because even a healthy bog adds less than half an inch in a century , they are not renewable from a practical standpoint . While gardening companies refer to \u201c harvesting \u201d peat , with the implication that it will return next year , environmental opponents refer to the process as \u201c mining . \u201d \u201c It 's a bit like coal , \u201d Mr. Crosher said . At current rates of removal , Dr. Knight said , Britain could run out of peat in just a few decades . He added that horticultural businesses should adjust to new concerns about global warming , as others have . \u201c There 's not a single sector that is n't facing massive changes . Think of Richard Branson , who has to change the fuel in his planes because of carbon emissions , \u201d Dr. Knight said , referring to the British airline magnate . \u201c There are a lot of people who have far bigger challenges . \u201d In England , peat is obtained partly from domestic bogs but mainly from Ireland , where it is still burned to heat some rural homes , as it has been for centuries . Canada supplies most of the peat sold in the United States . Gardening companies contend that peat is so abundant globally that they can harvest it sustainably , although they are working to develop alternatives . It is far easier to take peat from bogs than to manufacture compost from other decaying material like timber industry waste , and peat is much lighter and less expensive to ship . The government timetable calls for an end to peat use in British public parks and gardens by 2015 , in backyard gardening by 2020 and in commercial plant growing by 2030 . The British National Trust has already stopped using peat on its lands , as have many gardening experts who support the ban . Most gardening companies are producing reduced - peat and peat-free alternative soils , although most customers do not yet ask for them , said Andy Bailey , the horticulture manager at Blooms of Bressingham , a retail gardening center near here . Brenda Chase , who was buying a pair of orchids at Blooms on a rainy Monday , said she would continue to use peat as long as it was available . One of Britain 's largest home improvement and gardening chains , B&Q , drew the ire of environmentalists this year for introducing a topsoil containing 37 percent peat , even though it has supported the planned phaseout . The company declined to comment . Acknowledging that current peat -free products vary widely in quality , the government is developing new industry standards to encourage more gardeners to switch . Although Mr. Flowerdew acknowledged that most hobbyists would do fine without peat , he maintained that it was irreplaceable for cultivating certain hard - to - grow plants and for getting seeds to sprout . Rather than ban peat , he suggested , its trade should be regulated and taxed to make sure it is used judiciously . He worried that a ban could cause the British horticulture industry to lose out to growers in the Netherlands or Italy who would continue to use peat because it works so well .

Thirty - something fire- breather Mahanthappa is a dude who likes to scorch everything around him , and under-heralded vet Green has no problem turning lyricism into kinetics . They 've definitely caught the spirit on the new Apex , a record that storms in several different ways while wafting strains of South Indian music into the mix . Best of all : the leaders give their rhythm section enough elbow room to be equal partners . Do n't be shocked to see this team do a land - grab on more than a few best of 2010 lists . \u201d Jim Macnie , Village Voice \u201c Witness Mahanthappa 's ' Soft ' , which becomes anything but . Despite the sinuous , seductive theme , the interpretation is volcanic , from Moutin 's aggressive introductory solo to Reid 's crackling bursts and both euphorically building sax solos . Writing credits are split evenly between the two leaders , with Mahanthappa employing his trademark blend of rhythmic complexity and South Indian harmonic inspirations . Green 's tunes are , perhaps necessarily , closer to the jazz mainstream : ' Rainer and Theresia ' is a melancholy waltz with a noir tinge , while ' Lamenting ' is an aching ballad dominated by a starkly romantic Moran solo . ' Little Girl Ill Miss You ' , on which Mahanthappa is absent , contains the disc 's most singable melody , a standard that never was . \u201d \u2013 Shaun Brady , JazzTimes \u201c Born 36 years apart , the saxophonists Mr. Mahanthappa and the elder Mr. Green , an educator as well as a player , come from different corners of improvised jazz . They found their way to each other circuitously , and it seems as if they were meant to put a band together , sharing their rapid , searching , wide - interval saxophone language . \u201d \u2013 Ben Ratliff , The New York Times Fall Arts Preview \u201c \u2026 a rigorous , contemporary statement . \u201d \u2013 Peter Margasak , Chicago Reader Apex is a blazing collaboration between alto saxophonists Rudresh Mahanthappa and Bunky Green that puts on display a fifty - year continuum of state - of - the - art saxophone playing . Featuring the all - star band of Jason Moran on piano , Fran\u00e7ois Moutin on bass and switching off on drums , the dynamic Damion Reid and the legendary Jack DeJohnette , Apex shines a much -deserved spotlight on Bunky Green , a hugely influential but under-recognized original in jazz . As Mahanthappa tells it , \u201c I first heard about Bunky from the late great saxophone teacher Joe Viola when I was a student at Berklee in the early 90s . Joe heard me warming up once and recommended that I check Bunky out as he thought that my approach was on track to being something similar to his . He loaned me Bunky 's record Places We 've Never Been ( Vanguard ) which totally knocked me out ! \u201d Mahanthappa sought Green out and sent him a tape of his playing to which Green responded by providing some encouraging feedback , leading to a long friendship . Still , the two never got a chance to play together until 2008 during a jam session at the Jazz Baltica Festival . Inspired by that performance , Mahanthappa featured Green in his appearance at the 2009 Made In Chicago Festival . Soon thereafter , Rudresh made plans to record with Bunky , enlisting his regular bassist Fran\u00e7ois Moutin and the dynamic young drummer Damion Reid . Jason Moran , who had played on Green 's CD Another Place ( Label Bleu ) , also quickly signed on . The lineup was set when Mahanthappa told Jack DeJohnette in whose band Rudresh plays about the recording . DeJohnette , who had been a huge fan of Bunky 's from back when he was a young drummer coming up in Chicago , also clamored to play on the session . One can immediately see why Mahanthappa was drawn to Green 's playing : The two share a similar biting tone , harmonic sophistication , a well - articulated rapid fire attack , and a certain rhythmic elasticity . Perhaps whats most amazing about Green is that such modern playing is coming from a 75 year old . The album features originals by both Mahanthappa and Green specifically created for this collaboration . The compositions highlight a collective vision of using traditional forms as a launching point for contemporary improvisation and interaction at its highest level . On Apex , Bunky Green and Rudresh Mahanthappa look back over the last fifty years of jazz saxophone playing and together chart its course into the future ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Sensitive intelligence information shows that the Chinese Embassy on Connecticut Avenue NW here was used for planning contributions to the DNC , the sources said . Some information was obtained through electronic eavesdropping conducted by federal agencies . The information gives the Justice Department inquiry what is known as a foreign counterintelligence component , elevating the seriousness of the fund - raising controversy , according to some officials . The sources declined to provide details about the scope of the evidence relating to the alleged efforts by the Chinese representatives . They also declined to specify what foreign contributions might have been involved , but they said the new evidence now being scrutinized in the inquiry is serious . A Chinese Embassy spokesman denied yesterday that his government had anything to do with improper efforts to influence the administration . \" We have done nothing of that sort , \" the spokesman said . White House press secretary Michael McCurry said yesterday that \" to the best of my knowledge , no one here had any knowledge of \" the allegations concerning the Chinese . He said the White House would have no further comment . The evidence relating to the Chinese government led Justice Department lawyers and FBI executives to increase the number of FBI special agents working on a special investigative task force from a handful to 25 , including several specialists in foreign counterintelligence investigations , sources said . Laura Ingersoll , a Justice Department attorney assigned a leading role on the fund - raising task force , has security clearances to investigate a variety of sensitive intelligence matters , officials said . The new dimension to the fund - raising investigation could result in Attorney General Janet Reno eventually recommending that the matter be turned over to an independent counsel , according to one well - placed source . Reno so far has declined requests for an independent counsel , saying that the Justice Department task force can conduct a full and independent inquiry and that there is no specific and credible allegation of wrongdoing against any of the senior executive branch officials covered by the Independent Counsel Act . Such a finding would have to be made by the Justice Department task force before Reno could recommend appointment of an independent counsel . Washington and Beijing have been at odds over human rights and trade issues , but the Clinton White House has been seeking recently to improve relations . Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright is traveling to Beijing later this month , and President Clinton announced in his State of the Union message that he also would visit . He has extended an invitation to Chinese President Jiang Zemin to come to Washington . The Chinese effort to win influence with the Clinton administration can be traced to 1993 , one source said . During the Reagan and Bush administrations , the Chinese government felt comfortable dealing with Washington . During the 1992 presidential campaign , authorities in Beijing spoke openly about wanting Bush to win reelection because he was an \" old friend \" of China . Clinton had criticized the Bush administration during the campaign for \" coddling \" Beijing and giving China most-favored - nation trade status after the 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square . After Clinton defeated Bush , Chinese officials were uncertain about how to deal with the new administration , officials said , even though as president , Clinton essentially adopted the Bush policy toward Beijing . The Chinese Foreign Ministry has long urged the leadership in Beijing to increase its lobbying efforts in Washington , arguing that China has lagged behind Taiwan and Israel in trying to influence U.S. policy . Some investigators suspected a Chinese connection to the current fund - raising scandal because several DNC contributors and major fund - raisers had ties to Beijing . Last February , Charles Yah Lin Trie , a fund - raiser for the Democratic National Committee , used his influence with party officials to bring Wang Jun , head of a weapons trading company owned by the Chinese military , to a White House coffee with Clinton . Wang also heads a prominent , state - owned investment conglomerate . Clinton has since said he should not have met with Wang , and $ 640,000 in checks that Trie delivered to president 's legal defense fund has been returned because of questions about the source of the funds . Another reason investigators suspected a Chinese connection was the role of John Huang , a former Commerce Department official and DNC fund - raiser now at the center of the campaign controversy . An American citizen born in China and raised in Taiwan , Huang has said he now has no friends or relatives in China . But Huang is a former executive of the Lippo Group , a highly profitable Indonesian conglomerate owned by the Riady family , who are ethnic Chinese . Lippo has extensive interests in China , including approval to build a power plant in Fujian Province , Huang 's place of birth . In 1993 , Lippo sold 50 percent of its holdings in one of its banks , Hong Kong Chinese Bank where Huang was a vice president in the mid-1980s to a corporation run by the Chinese government . Huang was not the only Lippo executive to get a job with the Clinton administration . In December 1994 , U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor named Lippo 's president of securities , Charles De Queljoe , to the Investment and Services Advisory Committee . Huang had sought jobs at the State Department and the National Security Council staff for De Queljoe , a big Democratic giver , in an early 1993 letter to the White House . Last month , Rep. Gerald B.H. Solomon ( R-N.Y. ) , chairman of the House Rules Committee , asked FBI Director Louis J. Freeh to investigate Huang and the Lippo Group , with an eye to \" potential economic espionage against the United States by a foreign corporation having direct ties to the People 's Republic of China . \" Solomon said then that he was concerned about Huang 's access to intelligence information and dozens of calls Huang made from Commerce to the Lippo Group . He also asked Freeh to investigate apparent discrepancies in the birth date listed on Huang 's visa application forms and his government employment forms . Huang was employed at Lippo for nine years before he joined the Commerce Department as deputy assistant secretary for international economic policy . His severance package from Lippo totaled $ 788,750 . Huang was given a top-secret clearance at Commerce after what Republicans have called a lax background investigation . Despite Huang 's extensive ties to Lippo , the background investigation was limited to his activities in the United States because he had lived here for more than five years . Commerce officials now say they wish a foreign background check had been done , even though it was not required . In preparation for his job at Commerce , Huang received an interim security clearance while he was still working at Lippo . But Commerce Department officials said that did not entitle him to see any classified information , and they maintain he saw none . Because of a bureaucratic error , the officials said , Huang retained his top-secret clearance after he left the Commerce Department to become a DNC vice chairman in December 1995 . During his 18 months at Commerce , Huang was scheduled to attend 37 intelligence briefings , including briefings on China , and saw more than two dozen intelligence reports . From his Commerce Department office , Huang made more than 70 phone calls to a Lippo-controlled bank in Los Angeles . The calls are now being scrutinized by the Justice Department task force . Huang 's message slips from the Commerce Department also show a call from one Chinese Embassy official in February 1995 and three calls from the embassy 's commercial minister in June and August of that year . According to Huang 's Commerce Department desk calendar entries , obtained by The Washington Post , he had three meetings scheduled with Chinese government officials . He was slated to go on a U.S. government - sponsored trip to China in June 1995 that was canceled . He attended a policy breakfast at the Chinese Embassy in October 1995 and a dinner there the same month , his calendar shows . One of the many unexplained records from Huang 's files shows an unusual travel pattern in the fall of 1995 . His expense account records show he left his Commerce Department office to visit the Indonesian Embassy on Massachusetts Avenue NW on Oct. 11 , claiming a $ 5 reimbursement for taxicab fare . The expense records indicate Huang did not return to his office at Commerce until the following day when he took another $ 5 cab ride , not from the Indonesian Embassy but , according to his records , from the \" residence of the Chinese ambassador . \" Staff writers Susan Schmidt , Sharon LaFraniere and Lena H. Sun , special correspondent Anne Farris and research assistant Jeff Glasser contributed to this report . \u00a9 Copyright 1997 The Washington Post Company Back to the top"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

We 're not done yet ! Your opinion can help us make it better . After the ruling Social Democrats hit the news with inner-party fighting , the conservative Christian Democrat Union follows suit with its own wrangle over a reform plan put forth by the party 's Herzog Commission . Looking for the right dosage to cure Germany 's sickly health system . Last week the subject was inner-party fighting in Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der 's Social Democrat Party over reforms the German leader has been pushing for as part of his comprehensive \" Agenda 2010 \" package , which seeks to streamline the country 's behemoth social system in order to revive the sluggish economy . This week , the SPD wrangling , although still of interest considering the question of the party 's ability to secure a parliamentary majority in key October votes , is taking a backseat to the opposition 's own internal dispute over its reform proposals . The conservative Christian Democrat Union and its smaller Bavarian sister party , the Christian Social Union , have been busy drawing up their answer to Schr\u00f6der 's reform platform , one they claim will be socially just and economically viable . And just as the SPD assigned the task of drafting new proposals to several extra-parliamentarian committees , the CDU gave the job to CDU member and former German President Roman Herzog . On Monday evening , party leaders approved the Herzog Commission 's package of reform proposals which recommend , among other things , decoupling health and nursing care premiums from people 's earnings and levying a lump monthly sum across the board instead . CDU party leader Angela Merkel embraced the plans , calling them a \" paradigm shift \" and said they presented a \" most important switch for Christian Democratic politics . \" A violation of party principles ? But not everyone in the party is enthralled with the Herzog plan , and as is the case in the SPD with Agenda 2010 , several members are balking at what they consider a violation of the CDU 's core social values . Both high - ranking party members and CDU rank and file have criticized the proposals for placing the boss and the janitor on the same level and making both pay the same lump sum of \u20ac 264 for health insurance plus another \u20ac 60 to cover nursing care costs . CDU deputy leader Norbert Bl\u00fcm , a former labor minister under Chancellor Helmut Kohl , said the plan was socially unbalanced and would hurt common people while letting the more affluent off the hook . Bl\u00fcm warned on Monday that the Herzog proposals would turn the party into a neo-liberal party unattractive to most German voters . But Merkel quickly retorted : \" Whoever claims that the proposals are socially unbalanced and in stark contrast to core Christian Democrat values will be asked to come up with whatever they think may be better . I have n't seen any reasonable alternatives as yet . \" Stealing from the poor ? Another staunch critic of the reform plans , the head of the CDU employees ' association , Hermann - Josef Arentz , has already announced he 'll fight the Herzog suggestions tooth and nail , secure in the knowledge that he has much of the party behind him . \" The bottom line of these proposals is that people with low incomes will face a bigger burden as they will have to pay the same premiums as those with higher incomes , \" Arentz explained on Tuesday at the start of CDU regional conferences focused on gearing up support for the reforms . \" The Herzog Committee itself reckons that about \u20ac 40 billion in tax refunds will be needed to compensate the not-so- well - off in order to be able to call the scheme socially balanced . That 's about 20 percent of all taxes the state has at its disposal , \" Arentz said explaining his doubts about the feasibility of the reforms . Making matters even worse for the CDU leadership , it 's CSU sister party has also come out strongly against the Herzog plan . CSU : plan ' unjust ' On Wednesday Edmund Stoiber , Bavarian premier and last year 's chancellor candidate for the Union block , criticized the plans as \" unjust . \" Although he said the CSU was generally willing to compromise with the CDU on the much-needed structural reforms , he was insistent that the parties \" remain by their central philosophy , that people with higher incomes should pay more than those with lower incomes . \" He also criticized the Herzog proposal to raise the retirement age to 67 . On Nov. 17 , Stoiber will present his party 's plans for reforming Germany 's pension system . The split between the two conservative parties comes just two weeks after Stoiber and the CSU reached an all - time record high in state parliamentary elections . Many analysts believe that the willingness of the CSU to take a separate stance to the larger CDU has been strengthened by the surge in popularity in Bavaria . But when questioned about the difference in opinion between CDU and CSU , Stoiber replied , matter of factly : \" In the end we 'll find an agreement . That 's the way it 's always been . \" German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der has a party discipline problem . A handful of left-wing Social Democrats could scuttle key welfare and economic reforms , upon which he has staked his political future ( Sept. 29 , 2003 ) ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Centred around the usual Woolworths and Big W stores , Brickworks Marketplace will not shock first time visitors with too many unexpected revelations . If you 're already familiar with shopping malls such as Castle Plaza then you will quickly grasp the concept of Brickworks Marketplace . However there are still some pleasant surprises . The Entrance to Brickworks Marketplace This huge new redevelopment of the former Brickworks Markets had a turbulent and tumultuous conception . The mum and dad traders who had occupied the Brickworks Markets for decades were unsurprisingly unhappy when the West Torrens Council gave them the boot . As they were all small traders , most had pinned their hopes for a sound financial future on their shops . Sadly the former traders at the Brickworks were misguided in their hopes , and they are probably all collecting our tax dollars for their troubles . Woolworths wanted their land . The West Torrens Council wanted more money . And even many customers of the old Brickworks Markets thought that it was time - worn and lacking in interesting product , so the quirky markets were despatched to the dustbin of history . The Original Brickworks Markets before Demolition The new Brickworks Marketplace opened on June 25 2015 , to some fanfare . All the usual politicans were there including Treasurer \" Turbo \" Tom Koutsantonis who suddenly developed a startled rabbit - in- the - headlight look when asked about the future of the former traders . He was happier to spruik the 600 new jobs , 45 new shops , and 700 car parks . If figures are your forte you might want to know that this new shopping mall has a catchment area with an average age of 38 years , average household size 2.2 people , around $ 35 k pa income , and 37 % are couples with no kids . ( Source : Brickworks Marketplace advertisement ) . Pedestrian Walkways Through the Car park So what can you expect at the Brickworks Marketplace ? If the first couple of days are any guide then be prepared to wait for a park . Of course it 's probably opening fever , and the locals will no doubt be happy when that 's subsided . A pleasant surprise were the dedicated walkways and pedestrian crossings in the car park , making it easier to push your trolley of takings back home . Brick Lane Playground for Kids Work was still in progress at Brick Lane , the northern end of Brickworks Marketplace adjacent to the heritage listed brickworks when I visited . It seems that there will be something to connect the two , but it was n't clear what . At the western end of Brick Lane a soft floored playground was popular with a tribe of toddlers while their parents played with mobile phones . Zambrero Mexican Food on Brick Lane Nearby the latest addition to Zambrero 's Mexican franchise ( with a humanitarian face ) was doing a roaring trade with plenty of punters enjoying the opportunity for alfresco dining . Zambrero offers tacos , burritos and nachos , but I have n't tried their food yet . Food Choices at the North End of the Shopping Mall Heading south into the Brickworks Marketplace shopping mall uncovered a few surprises - if you come hungry you will have plenty of food choices . Reade Book is a combination bookstore and cafe that was already busy . The Cicheti Italian food bar was not yet open , but Joy of India , Dumpling Dumpling were already open and Iiced had gelati with all the colours of the rainbow . There were plenty of the usual suspects you 'll find in most modern shopping malls . A Smokemart , the ubiquitous Specsavers , engravers and keycutters , Flight Centre , Zamels and EB Games jostled for your attention with Vodafone and Optus . Rockmans Clothing and Moda Alterations were new to me though . Take Away Food Choices Include Tokyo Sushi and Yiros Central At the north end of Brickworks Marketplace is where the crowds were at lunchtime . More food choices abounded and most tables were taken with what looked like locals in work clothes . If you could n't find something to your taste here , then you are fussy . Tokyo Sushi , Yiros Central , and Zeea 's Eatery for Italian food were all doing a roaring trade . Another shop , probably Three Little Cafe was still being fitted out . Yiros Central in the Shopping Mall The new Brickworks Marketplace at Torrensville will fill the bill for an area lacking in shopping facilities close by . I thought the food choices were somewhat more inspired than average , but others may disagree . At the end of a day it will be successful , and does n't the end justifies the means ? See the Brickworks Marketplace website for a complete list of shops , although descriptions are sparse as yet . Of course there 's a Facebook page too . If you feel a bit parched after traversing the Brickworks Marketplace car park you will be pleased to know that a Dan Murphy 's liquor store awaits you in Torrensville too ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

A culture of power abuse and impunity within the military came under the spotlight last month when a Thai soldier went on a shooting rampage killing 29 people , triggered by a dispute over a housing deal involving his superior officer . The report outlined other abuses including incidents where commanders forced conscripts to jump into septic tanks or to eat \" like dogs \" , using their mouths and not their hands . It also described sexual humiliation where conscripts were forced by superiors to hold one another 's penises . \" Abuses of new conscripts in the Thai military have long been an open secret . What our research shows is that such maltreatment is not the exception but the rule , and deliberately hushed within the military , \" said Clare Algar , Amnesty International 's senior director for research , advocacy and policy . A military spokesman said he had not reviewed the Amnesty report but that past abuses had been addressed . \" We are taking the issue of abuses seriously and any commander implicated will be transferred , face disciplinary action and criminal charges too , \" Defence Ministry spokesman Lieutenant General Kongcheep Tantrawanit said . \" In the past two to three years there have been very few cases , so some of the cases people talk about are maybe old information . \" Military service is compulsory in Thailand and each year , thousands of men over 21 take part in a recruitment lottery .

And it all looked so weird on his broad body ... Away from Hanley 's funny looks , The Black Rider consists of motorbike clubs , investigative journalism and atomic weaponry being smuggled into sleepy coastal village under the auspice of some old folklore about a sinister satanic figure that haunts the area . Essentially its the kind of hoary old yarn that would keep readers of 50s and 60s comic strips and Boys Own annuals enthralled . In fact , as a child stalking jumble sales in the 80s for back issues I was just as enthralled myself ! Oh and Leslie Dwyer is shown to have just as much contempt for snotty nosed kids here as he had twenty - six years later in Hi-de - Hi Review by Paul D I 'll freely admit that my passion for this movie is beyond all reason , much like Jimmy Hanley 's oddly posh accent seen here and only here , there 's no accounting for it . Previous review : boxd.it/8PqPX Review by loureviews In the USA , Marlon Brando was asking ' whaddya got ' in biker leathers - while in the UK the rather staid looking Jimmy Hanley was our kind of rebel . The ' evil mission ' of the tagline is a misnomer as this film has little tension and certainly none of the Brando sex appeal which made the motorcycle lifestyle attractive . Review by Melody You know it 's a very British biker movie when they do n't even dismount for the egg-and - spoon race . Review by Paul D While America had the likes of The Wild One and Easy Rider and Electraglide in Blue and Australia had Stone and Mad Max , over here in Britain we had The Black Rider . Yes indeed , the story of a ' young ' newspaper reporter who saves up his money to buy a motorbike so he can fulfil his lifelong ambition to , err , do reliability trials . OK , so it 's does n't have the scenes of bikes tearing off down highways the disappear off into the horizon , but this is Britain . Instead we have to make do with trundling slowly around over bits of heathland , skilfully negotiating gorse bushes .

Graphic mobile phone images sent to the newspaper by migrants held inside the detention centres show dozens of emaciated men crippled by the Arabian heat lying shirtless in tightly packed rows in small rooms with barred windows . One photo shows what appears to be a corpse swathed in a purple and white blanket in their midst . They say it is the body of a migrant who had died of heatstroke and that others are barely getting enough food and water to survive . Another image , too graphic to publish , shows a young African man hanged from a window grate in an internal tiled wall . The adolescent killed himself after losing hope , say his friends , many of whom have been held in detention since April . The migrants , several displaying scars on their backs , claim they are beaten by guards who hurl racial abuse at them . \u201c It 's hell in here . We are treated like animals and beaten every day , \u201d said Abebe , an Ethiopian who has been held at one of the centres for more than four months . \u201c If I see that there is no escape , I will take my own life . Others have already , \u201d he added via an intermediary who was able to communicate on a smuggled phone . \u201c My only crime is leaving my country in search of a better life . But they beat us with whips and electric cords as if we were murderers . \u201d The images and testimony have sparked outrage among human rights activists , and have particular resonance in light of the global Black Lives Matter protests . \" Photos emerging from detention centres in southern Saudi Arabia show that authorities there are subjecting Horn of Africa migrants to squalid , crowded , and dehumanising conditions with no regard for their safety or dignity , \u201d said Adam Coogle , deputy director of Human Rights Watch in the Middle East , after being shown the images by The Sunday Telegraph . \u201c The squalid detention centres in southern Saudi Arabia fall well short of international standards . For a wealthy country like Saudi Arabia , there 's no excuse for holding migrants in such deplorable conditions , \" Mr Coogle added . Oil-rich Saudi Arabia has long exploited migrant labour from Africa and Asia . In June 2019 , an estimated 6.6 m foreign workers made up about 20 per cent of the Gulf nation 's population , most occupying low paid and often physically arduous jobs . The migrants work mainly in construction and manual domestic roles that Saudi nationals prefer not to do themselves . Many are from South Asia , but a large contingent come from the Horn of Africa , which lies across the Red Sea . The detention centres identified by The Sunday Telegraph house mainly Ethiopian men and there are said to be others packed with women . Over the last decade , tens of thousands of young Ethiopians have made their way to the Gulf state , often aided by Saudi recruitment agents and people traffickers , in a bid to escape poverty back home . They have been trapped partly as a result of the pandemic but also by the ' Saudization ' of the kingdom 's workforce , a policy introduced by Muhamad Bin Salman , the Crown Prince who took power three years ago . The testimonies gathered by The Sunday Telegraph directly from migrants on encrypted channels about the conditions they now find themselves in are harrowing . \u201c Plenty of inmates are suicidal or suffering from mental illnesses as a result of living this for five months , \u201d said one . \u201c The guards mock us , they say ' your government does n't care , what are we supposed to do with you ? \u201d \u201c A young boy , about sixteen , managed to hang himself last month . The guards just throw the bodies out back as if it was trash , \u201d said another . When the pandemic struck in March , the Saudi government in the capital Riyadh feared the migrants , who are often housed in overcrowded conditions , would act as vectors for the virus . Almost 3,000 Ethiopians were deported by the Saudi security services back to Ethiopia in the first ten days of April and a leaked UN memo said a further 200,000 were to follow . A moratorium was then placed on the deportations after international pressure was brought to bear on Riyadh . The Sunday Telegraph has found many of the migrants who were slated for deportation five months ago have been left to rot in disease- ridden detention centres . \u201c We have been left to die here , \u201d said one , who said he has been locked in a room the size of a school classroom and not been outside since March . \u201c Covid19 ? Who knows ? , he added , \u201c There are a lot of diseases here . Everyone is sick here ; everyone has something . \u201d The images smuggled out show many of those held are plagued by disfiguring skin infections . They claim they have received no medical treatment . \u201c We eat a tiny piece of bread in the day and rice in the evening . There 's almost no water , and the toilets are overflowing . It spills over to where we eat . The smell , we grow accustomed to . But there 's over a hundred of us in a room , and the heat is killing us , \u201d said another young Ethiopian man . A short video clip smuggled out shows several rooms covered with filth from an overflowing squat toilet . One Ethiopian man can be heard shouting out : \u201c The toilets are clogged . We tried unblocking them , but we 're unable to . So we live in this filth , we sleep in it too . \u201d \u201c To [ the Saudis ] or even to Abiy , it 's like we 're ants . When we die , it 's as if an ant died , no one cares or pays attention , \u201d the man added , referring to Ethiopia 's Nobel Peace Prize - winning Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed . Saudi Arabia is deeply stratified by race and cast . African migrants enjoy few legal rights and many complain of exploitation , sexual and racial abuse from employers . New laws further limiting the rights and employment prospects of foreign labourers were introduced in 2013 and crackdowns have continued under the rule of the young Crown Prince Muhamad Bin Salman , who took power in 2017 . The Sunday Telegraph was able to geolocate two of the centres . One is in Al Shumaisi , near the holy city of Mecca and one is in Jazan , a port town near Yemen . There are believed to be others housing thousands of Ethiopians . Migrants in each of the centres said there were hundreds of them in each room . Satellite imagery shows there are several buildings at both centres , meaning there may be far more migrants in each centre who are uncontactable . Several of the migrants said they had been rounded up from their homes in various Saudi Arabian cities before being placed in the camps . Others are African refugees from war-torn Yemen . Earlier this month , Human Rights Watch reported that Houthi forces used Covid - 19 as a pretext to expel thousands of Ethiopian migrants into neighbouring Saudi Arabia . Testimonies gathered by the NGO say that the Houthis killed dozens of Ethiopians and forced others at gunpoint over the Saudi border . Saudi border guards then fired on the fleeing migrants , killing dozens more . \u201c Saudi Arabia , a wealthy country , has long held undocumented migrants including many from the Horn of Africa in conditions that are so crowded , unsanitary , and appalling that migrants often emerge traumatised or sick , \u201d said Mr Coogle . \u201c It 's fair to question whether Saudi authorities are purposefully allowing these detention conditions to exist in order to punish migrants , \u201d he added . The Sunday Telegraph approached the Saudi Arabian embassy in London for comment but had not received any at the time of going to press . A representative of the Ethiopian government in the Middle East was also unsuccessfully approached for comment . * Migrants ' names have been changed to protect their identity Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

By a 210 to 210 tie vote that GOP leaders prolonged for 23 tumultuous minutes while they corralled dissident members , the House rejected a proposed change to the USA Patriot Act that would have barred the Justice Department from searching bookstore and library records . White House officials , citing the nearly three - year - old law 's importance as an anti-terrorism tool , warned that an attempt to weaken it would be vetoed . But the victory came only after GOP tactics infuriated Democrats and a number of Republicans . The vote , scheduled to last 15 minutes , dragged on for 38 minutes despite outraged shouts and a unified chant of \" shame , shame , shame \" from Democrats across the aisle . The showdown was the latest in a series of bipartisan challenges this week on the House floor to administration positions on trade sanctions against Cuba , budget cuts in a major loan program of the Small Business Administration , and funding for programs promoting democracy abroad . Last month , the House approved a natural resources bill that slashed many of the Bush administration 's initiatives in land conservation and the environment . Last week , Senate negotiators , defying the White House , insisted on pushing for a six- year transportation bill costing $ 318 billion -- $ 62 billion above the administration ceiling . With President Bush 's approval rating slipping as a result of setbacks in the Iraq war , lawmakers in both parties appear emboldened to defy the White House and the House GOP leadership . \" The Republican leadership is out of control , \" said Rep. Martin T. Meehan ( D- Mass . ) . \" Today 's vote on the Freedom to Read Protection Act is just the latest example of a growing trend towards abusive , closed - fist partisanship on the part of Republican House leadership . \" Rep. C.L. Butch Otter ( R- Idaho ) , a conservative and an advocate of the defeated provision , told reporters after the vote : \" You win some , and some get stolen . \" At one point the electronic tally board above the visitors ' gallery showed the proposal passing , 219 to 201 . But as the Republican whip organization went to work to get defectors to switch , the number of those voting for passage dropped steadily . The final count recorded 18 Republicans joining 191 Democrats and Rep. Bernard Sanders ( Vt. ) , the House 's lone Independent and the chief author of the amendment to limit some powers of the Patriot Act . Sanders called the proceedings \" an outrage \" and \" an insult to democracy . \" The House has voted in the past to block portions of the Patriot Act , but Congress has never managed to alter any part of it . The law was quickly passed in the weeks after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . It gave the government strong powers and leeway to conduct investigations and detain suspects . Supporters of the Sanders proposal argued that fighting terrorism did not justify encroachments on basic liberties that are implicit in the broad authority the act gives to law enforcement agencies charged with hunting terrorists . Addressing the House before the vote , Sanders said : \" All of us want to support the law enforcement officials going after terrorists , but we can defeat terrorism without allowing the government to get a secret order from a secret court without any showing of any evidence that the person whose reading records are sought is engaged in any kind of illegal conduct . \" His amendment had the support of groups that include the American Booksellers Association , the American Library Association and the PEN American Center , representing writers . Supporters of the Patriot Act say authorities need to track potential al Qaeda members who communicate using Internet facilities in public libraries . Under the current law , authorities need a special court order to require libraries and other venues to provide records on the sale or borrowing of books and on Internet sites used . Rep. Frank R. Wolf ( R- Va. ) , who chairs the subcommittee that drafted the underlying spending legislation before the House yesterday , said , \" I believe the Patriot Act has helped \" safeguard the safety of Americans . Other Republicans said there were few examples of the act being used to invade the privacy of library users . Yesterday 's battle was over an amendment to a $ 39.8 billion bill financing the departments of Commerce , Justice and State for next year , which passed 397 to 18 . The Senate has not taken up its version of the spending measure . The floor fight was reminiscent of November 's vote on a Medicare prescription drug program , when GOP House leaders kept the vote going for nearly three hours while they persuaded reluctant members to support passage of the bill . \u00a9 2004 The Washington Post Company"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

That night , in Salt Lake City , curlers Rhona Martin , Debbie Knox , Janice Rankin and Fiona MacDonald became Britain 's first gold medal winners at a Winter Olympics for 18 years . The unlikely triumph of four ordinary Scottish women in a sport most English people had never heard of was a sensation . They were feted as \" housewife superstars \" . Flag - waving crowds gathered at Heathrow to welcome them home , they were awarded MBEs and summoned on to Richard and Judy 's sofa . \" You have captured the imagination of the whole of the UK , \" wrote Tony Blair in a congratulatory fax . There was talk of a Hollywood movie . But when the celebrations died down and the invitations dried up , these four athletes , the first Scots to win gold at a winter games since 1936 , attracted less welcome attention . The fifth member of their team , the substitute Margaret Morton , told the Scottish Sun she felt excluded and said : \" I do n't particularly respect them for their personalities , but of course I respect them for what they achieved . \" There were news reports of Rhona Martin , the team 's \" skip \" , splitting from her husband and being forced to sell her family home . By then , Martin \u2013 despite all those predictions of sponsorship deals \u2013 was a single mother living on benefits . The breakdown of MacDonald 's marriage to a fellow curling star was reported too ; it was \" the curse of the curlers \" . So , eight years on , have those gold medals turned out to be a curse or a blessing ? Martin is now 43 and the coach of Scotland 's junior curling team as well as being part of UK Sport 's elite coaching programme . With her mop of blond hair , she still looks as fit as ever . The only member of the gold - medal - winning team to play on in the 2006 Winter Olympics , she will be commentating on curling for the BBC at the Vancouver Games this year ; her protege , Eve Muirhead , is the 19- year - old skip of the women 's team . Known for her passion and enthusiastic communication \u2013 curlers emit what sound like high - pitched yelps to instruct their teammates how vigorously to scrub the ice with their brushes \u2013 Martin says she will struggle to sit calmly during the curling . \" It 'll be good fun but I 'm bad enough when I 'm coaching so I do n't know , \" she says . Listening to the former skip on TV \" will be so funny , \" says Rankin , who lives in Elgin and is the full - time mother of four young children . Martin \" gets very excited when she 's watching curling \" , says Knox , who lives with her family near Edinburgh and , just as she did eight years ago , works for Standard Life . \" She knows what she 's talking about . She 'll be fab , \" says MacDonald , who is now a business manager for Macrae & Dick car dealers in Inverness . Despite living hundreds of miles apart in Scotland , the four curlers are still in touch . Knox coaches with Martin in her spare time , and the pair were planning to meet Rankin for dinner shortly before this year 's games . \" Unfortunately I have n't seen Fiona in ages , \" says Rankin . \" We do send Christmas cards and put a bit of chat in but we 're just all so busy . \" The team were orginally assembled by Martin , and played together for years before entering the 2002 Winter Olympics as underdogs . Canada , for whom curling is a national sport backed by serious funds , was expected to win . To make matters worse , Martin was seriously ill , and Britain struggled at first . They scraped through two playoffs to reach the semi-finals . Then they found their momentum , dispatching Canada and finally Switzerland , winning the tightest of games with Martin 's last shot . They were overwhelmed when they found themselves surrounded by 30,000 people at the medal plaza in Salt Lake City . \" We thought , what have we done ? \" says Martin . \" We stood on the podium and we were used to being Scotland 's team with our own national anthem . All of a sudden God Save the Queen came on and we were thinking , ' Uh - oh ' . That 's when it hit me . \" The quartet were oblivious to the frenzy back home . \" After we won the final I phoned one of my friends and said , ' We won ! Did you watch it ? ' \" says Rankin . \" And she said , ' Did we watch it ? The whole flipping country watched it ! ' \" But it was still a surprise when they entered Heathrow to find crash barriers keeping back flag - waving fans . \" We were thinking , ' Blimey , there are a lot of people here . Who are they here to see ? ' \" says Rankin . They were , says Knox , naive , and that made the next phase of their lives all the more bizarre and thrilling . \" We went on Lorraine Kelly 's show and we got taken out with a personal shopper who picked us clothes to wear \u2013 it was ' from curlers to dressed - up ladies ' . \" The highlight for Rankin , a keen tennis player , was being invited into the royal box at Wimbledon , where the crowd gave them a round of applause . Martin still sounds astonished by the memory . \" It was just surreal . \" When they collected their MBEs from the Queen , the women and their families were put up at Claridge 's . \" Three years later one of my daughters said , ' When are we going to stay in that hotel with that man in a lift again ? ' \" recalls Knox . In a sense , they became the Susan Boyles of their day : celebrated but also slightly belittled by some of the media coverage . They were athletes who had mastered a fiendishly challenging sport while holding down ordinary jobs , yet the talk was of housewives with brooms ; did they feel patronised ? \" No , because we 'd had it for years , \" says Martin . Locally , there was a lot of recognition and affection . \" I still have customers who recognise me . That 's quite nice after eight years , \" says MacDonald . Of course , talk of life - changing amounts of money and a Hollywood film came to nothing . \" We were getting excited about who could play us , reeling off names like Julia Roberts , \" says Knox . \" That was silly . We thought then , how on earth are they going to make a film out of curling ? \" Martin did some promotional work with B&Q and was given a car for a year and that was it . \" We played Canada in the semis and they were so gutted we beat them , \" says Martin . \" They said afterwards we 'd cost them millions . To them , money was a huge part of winning but to us it was never , ever a thought . \" In Canada , teams play for thousands of dollars , says Martin . \" We play and win a lasagne dish . \" Knox would rather have her gold medal than lots of money though . \" There are still people who say we should 've made fortunes out of it but it just never came about , \" she says . \" We knew the hype about it would n't last that long . \" Their lingering fame was enough , however , for journalists to sniff out negative stories . Nowadays , none of the four are in contact with Morton . \" It is hard when the media goes through your personal life because you 're not used to that at all , \" says Martin , who is still single but has her own home again with her 17- year - old daughter and 14- year - old son . The team 's youngest member , MacDonald , who is now 35 , was the first to retire from curling , just three months after their triumph . While Martin and Knox coach , and Rankin is enjoying playing local games after four years away from the sport , MacDonald has not curled again , apart from a couple of charity games . Did she quit because she was uncomfortable with being a celebrity ? \" It was n't about that at all . I 'm a 100 % or nothing person . I knew I 'd won my gold medal and it was time to put my efforts into something else , \" she says . \" I 'm glad I quit while I was ahead . \" MacDonald has another partner now but she and her son will be cheering on her ex , Ewan , at the Olympics this time around . His British team are current world champions . \" I would n't miss it for the world , \" she says . \" I know how important it is to the men 's team and I really hope Ewan can fulfil his dreams this time . It 's important for him and for his little boy as well because his dad has been away quite a lot in recent years . \" The four are phlegmatic about the fact that while curling is reasonably well funded at an elite level , ordinary curling clubs across Scotland have continued to close in recent years . \" There were more people wanting to curl afterwards and they ran ' come and try ' sessions . That generated quite a lot of interest but the clubs were going to go under anyway , \" says Knox . \" Just because we won the Olympic medal does n't necessarily mean the whole country is going to take up curling . \" So did winning Olympic gold change their lives at all ? \" I 'm not sure it changed my life but it definitely made me a stronger and better person , \" says MacDonald ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Elizabeth Truss , the early years minister , has proposed that childminders , currently restricted to looking after three children per staff member from the ages of one to five inclusive , should in future be permitted to look after four children . They would also be allowed to look after two children under one year of age , instead of the current one . Truss will seek to allay parents ' fears of their children being neglected by overpressed staff , pointing out that the relaxation she proposes still leaves more restrictive ratios than Denmark , France and Germany \u2013 three countries often cited as providing high - quality care for pre-school children . The minister will quote experts claiming that in Britain more qualifications are needed to look after animals than toddlers . She is also proposing that nurseries be allowed to relax their ratios when qualified staff are present , increasing from four to six two -year - old children per staff member . In the case of one-year -olds , the permitted staff - to - child ratios would rise from the current one - to - three to one - to - four . The ratios would rise further if a fully - qualified teacher is present . She will also relax how these rules are interpreted . \" One of the problems that parents have is not just the exorbitant cost , it is the availability [ of childcare ] . I personally have struggled to find a nursery place for love or money , and many parents say that , \" Truss said on Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday morning . By raising care ratios , Truss said , popular operations would be able to expand by economies of scale , which would make childcare more widely available . Reforms , she said , would also mean better paid and better qualified staff . \" The pay level of staff at the moment \u2013 nursery workers are getting \u00a3 6.60 an hour \u2013 it 's barely more than the minimum wage . I do not think that is an acceptable wage rate for what should be a professional job . \" What I want to see [ in nursery care ] is something that is much more a continuum of the education system . \" The Department for Education ( DfE ) said the proposals were dependent on staff possessing higher qualifications , including C-grade GCSE maths and English . The DfE said : \" England 's relatively tight ratios have two main effects : higher costs for parents and lower pay for staff . In turn , low pay drags down the quality of the workforce . In other countries providers can use the extra income they get from taking on more children to reduce fees for parents and pay staff more , but this is not possible in England . \" The proposed flexibility has been labelled \" unacceptable and a recipe for disaster \" by the Pre-School Learning Alliance , the largest representative organisation of early years providers . Labour has also attacked the proposals . The shadow education secretary , Stephen Twigg , said : \" Experts are warning this could threaten child safety and wo n't reduce costs . Parents will be worried . \" Truss is also to propose that \" one - stop shop \" child agencies be given more freedom to help home - based childminders . Truss will tell the Policy Exchange thinktank : \" We have seen a decrease in the number of childminders over recent years . This is , in part , because childminders have to be business owners . Some people want a simpler way to enter the profession and parents want to be assured of quality . So we are setting up ' one - stop shops ' called childminder agencies to do the practicalities and to give parents some reassurance over quality . \" She added she would introduce graduate - level early years teachers trained specifically to teach young children . Only 23 % of nursery staff , and 10 % of home - based childminders , are qualified to A-level standard or equivalent .

Plans are taking shape for lavish celebrations \u2013 including a host of TV and radio documentaries and books , and even a float at the Notting Hill carnival \u2013 of an anniversary that many hope will bring belated recognition to one of England 's greatest but most overlooked creations . Eight hundred years ago next year , on 15 June 1215 , on the banks of the Thames in Runnymede , an embattled King John met the English barons , who had backed his failed war against the French and were seeking to limit his powers . The weakened monarch had little choice but to witness the sealing of what some say is the world 's most important document , one that , symbolically at least , established a new relationship between the king and his subjects . Thus the original Magna Carta , 3,500 words in Latin on a calfskin parchment , came into being , its enduring relevance confirmed in the many legal cases in which it is cited today . But while lawyers worship Magna Carta for laying the foundations for modern democracy , the defence of personal liberty and the protection of freedoms around the world , Britain largely ignores it . The 750th anniversary passed in 1965 with little fanfare . Plans for the 700th anniversary were abandoned due to the first world war . An appeal to the government for a national holiday next year , backed by many MPs , was rejected . History as an academic discipline has also often been reluctant to pay homage . The 1214 battle of Bouvines , the decisive battle after which England was forced to concede it had lost most of its lands in France , a pivotal moment in the weakening of John 's position , has been described as \u201c the most important battle in history that nobody has ever heard of \u201d . And until recently Magna Carta was only on the periphery of the history syllabus . Even David Cameron , when asked on a US chat show , was unable to say what Magna Carta means in English ( answer : \u201c Great Charter \u201d ) . Runnymede also appears underwhelmed by its place in history . The only memorial to Magna Carta within the National Trust park that incorporates the meadow , bisected by a busy road , is a small , domed shelter built in 1957 by the American Bar Association . Two signs explain how the Pilgrim Fathers took a copy of Magna Carta with them , which helped Americans to frame their constitution , and how the document was used by Nancy Astor to promote universal suffrage , and by William Wilberforce and Abraham Lincoln to press for the abolition of slavery . The absence of a more fitting British memorial is surprising . Apparently the National Trust feared that putting Runnymede on the cultural map would cause traffic problems . \u201c I've been wondering why that is [ the absence of a visitor centre ] for 20 years , \u201d said Sir Robert Worcester , chairman of the Magna Carta 800th Committee who can trace his family back to the Pilgrim Fathers . He describes Magna Carta as \u201c England 's greatest export \u201d , and reels off the key tenets it has bequeathed to the world \u2013 \u201c due process of law ; no one is above the law ; justice delayed is justice denied ; no taxation without representation ; the English Church shall be free \u201d . Worcester and his fellow enthusiasts hope 2015 will be the year Magna Carta gets the anniversary it deserves . Tens of millions of national lottery pounds are being poured into key Magna Carta sites across England . Websites have been constructed ; commemorative gold coins and stamps are to be issued ; a peal of bells will ring from churches ; a series of lectures around the world , starting with one by Neil MacGregor , director of the British Museum , will emphasise the document 's enduring importance ; the British Library will host the largest exhibition in its history ; special songs and poems will be performed ; Magna Carta will even get its own display at the Notting Hill carnival . The creation of a visitor centre near Runnymede could also become a reality . Worcester talks optimistically of signing a deal with Royal Holloway University , which is a couple of miles away . However , capturing public interest remains a challenge . \u201c Unlike other artefacts which may be a bit more sexy , it 's a piece of parchment with some rather unintelligible words written on it in Latin , \u201d acknowledged Sandra Matthews - Marsh , chief executive of Visit Kent , the body that promotes tourism in the county keen to put itself on the newly launched Magna Carta tourist map . \u201c But the exhibition designers and curators we 've appointed are really excited about the job . Their task is to bring the thing to life , not only to tell the story of why it was so important but what its relevance is today . \u201d It is a task in need of fulfilment . Last Thursday a British Asian family , father , mother , grandmother and three daughters , walked across the meadow at Runnymede and stood in front of the American Bar Association 's memorial . \u201c What do you mean , ' Is that all there is ? ' , \u201d the mother hissed in response to a mumbled observation from one of her daughters . For several minutes the family examined the signs and took selfies . Then they made their way back to the nearby car park and its National Trust tearoom . The US - built memorial stood unobserved in the autumn sunshine . Across the meadow came the roar of traffic , its drivers oblivious to the fact they were speeding past history . Magna Carta ? So what was that all about ? I 've heard of it . Some Latin document written long ago . Did n't David Cameron talk about it on a chat show once ? Yes . He was forced to admit he did not know what Magna Carta was in English . Idiot . So what does it mean ? Great Charter . Sounds impressive . Indeed . Originally issued in 1215 , it was the first document forced on to a king of England by his subjects as they sought to protect their privileges and limit his powers . The first ? Yes , it was annulled by the pope nine weeks later . It was redrafted in 1216 , 1217 and 1225 . It was confirmed as English law in 1297 , but most parts have been repealed . Most parts ? Clause 1 , securing the freedom of the English church ; Clause 9 , guaranteeing the \u201c ancient liberties \u201d of the City of London ; and Clause 29 , the right to due process , are still in force . Due process . Sounds like an 80s pop band . It was the clause that laid the foundations for the individual freedoms we enjoy today . Remind me again what it says . \u201c No Freeman shall be taken or imprisoned , or be disseised of his Freehold , or Liberties , or free Customs , or be outlawed , or exiled , or any other wise destroyed ; nor will We not pass upon him , nor condemn him , but by lawful judgment of his Peers , or by the Law of the land . We will sell to no man , we will not deny or defer to any man either Justice or Right . \u201d So we have Magna Carta to thank for cutting our monarchs down to size ? At the time it had little effect on curtailing monarchical powers , but it carried great symbolism . It gave succour to those opposing the king during the English civil war and helped lead to the rule of constitutional law throughout the English -speaking world ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

Montolieu produced the first French adaptation / translation in 1814 which included material she had added herself ; \" the first English translation was by probably the work of William Godwin and was published by his wife , M. J. Godwin in 1814 [ but see below ] as The Family Robinson Crusoe and described as a transation ' from the German of M. Wiss , ' though it incorporated some of Montolieu 's additions . The Godwin version was re-issued in a longer version in 1816 , and the book 's familiar title first used in 1818 . In 1824 Montolieu produced a yet larger version in French ; she added the adventures of Fritz , Franz , Ernest and Jack \" ( Oxford Companion , p. 510 ) . Still other writers added yet further ( improbable ) adventures ; interestingly these as well as the adventures added by Montolieu are among the best known . The story \" as originally published lacked a clear ending , and concluded with the boys ' father wondering ( after two years on the island ) whether the family wouldl ever see another human face again . An editor 's postscript followed , explaining that three or four years later they were discovered by an English vessel whose Captain was given their journal , but the ship was driven away again before they could be rescued . Later texts introeduced the character of an English girl who is shipwrecked on a neighbouring rock and discovered by one of the boys . He returns to England with her while the rest of the family remain ; others settlers join them , and the island eventually becomes a flouishing colony , ' New Switzerland ' \" ( Oxford Companion , p. 510 ) The reader will want to know that William H. G. Kingston 's version of The Swiss Family Robinson is an Englished shortened version of Isabelle de Montolieu 's Le Robinson suisse , ou , Journal d'un p\u00e8re de famille , naufrag\u00e9 avec ses enfans . Other English editions which claim include the whole of the Wyss- Montolieu narrative are by W. H. Davenport Adams ( 1869 - 0 ) and Mrs H. B. Paull ( 1879 ) . As Carpenter and Prichard write , \" with all the expansions and contractions \" over the past two centuries ( this includes a long history of abridgements , condensations , Christianizings , and Disney products ) , \" Wyss 's original narative has long since been obscured , and the book is chiefly characterized by its improbable profusion of animals -- penguins , kangaroos , monkeys and even a whale - conveniently gathered together on a tropical island \" ( Oxford Companion , p. 510 ) . As to its connection with 18th century thought and Montolieu , Wyss 's attitude towards education is Rousseauist . The adventures are presented as the basis of lessons in natural history and the physical sciences and resemble numbers of other similar educational books for children in this period , for example , Charlotte Smith 's Rural Walks : in Dialogues intended for the use of Young Persons ( 1795 ) , Rambles Further : A continuation of Rural Walks ( 1796 ) A Natural History of Birds , intended chiefly for young persons ( 1807 ) . In other words , Wyss 's book belongs to the subgenre of children 's literature which was developing at the time whose practitioners included the Edgeworths , Thomas Day ( Sandford and Merton ) -- and Montolieu 's friend , St\u00e9phanie - F\u00e9licit\u00e9 de Genlis , one of the earliest of the French writers ( e.g , Les Veill\u00e9es du Ch\u00e2teau or Tales of the Castle : Or , Stories of Instruction and Delight ( 1785 ) . Wyss differs from all these because his book comes out of a German pietistic milieu , is long and involved , and is based on the model of Defoe 's Robinson Crusoe and is a genuine adventure story , though it is continuously didactic ; as Carpenter and Prichard remark , \" as the family 's \" ship founders at the beginning of the story , [ the father ] pauses to explain to one of the boys the principle of the lever \" ( Oxford Companion , p. 510 ) . It should be noted that a number of Godwin scholars dispute the assertion that the English translation which appeared in 1814 was by William Godwin ; they think the translation was by his second wife . The book is also shaped in accordance with Christian thought and lessons . The following excerpt from an anonymous intelligent review on Amazon ( written on April 26 , 2001 ) reflects its strong Christian , idealizing and optimistic thrust , which help account for the book 's appeal and continual reprinting and adaptations : Daniel Defoe 's Robinson Crusoe carved a literary niche for the survival story , and The Swiss Family Robinson is one of the many stories carved in that mould . Written from the perspective of the father , it chronicles the first - hand account of the shipwreck and survival of a Swiss family of six on a remote island somewhere near New Guinea . The family consists of a Swiss pastor who is a walking encyclopedia on agricultural practices from around the world ; his wife who excels in equal measure with culinary skills , and four energetic sons . Displaying remarkable resilience and resourcefulness , they survive completely alone for over ten years until their rescue . In the process , they create their own European civilization , showing complete mastery over animals and plants , and creatively establishing houses . The bulk of the novel consists of their struggle for survival with their endless discovery of new species of plants and animals .. Readers should be warned that different versions of the Swiss Family Robinson abound . The Swiss pastor originally credited with the work - Johann David Wyss ( 1743 - 1818 ) - originally told many of these tales to his children , one of whom was likely responsible for the editing and publication of it . It was subsequently translated into many languages , with translators taking major liberties in abridgement or adding episodes of their own . The Disney film version , for instance , contains confrontations with pirates that are entirely absent from the original . Some versions speak of the shipwrecked lass as \" Jenny \" , others as \" Emily \" . The version I read ( the Puffin Classics edition ) was the translation of WHG Kingston , first published in 1879 , and widely regarded as one of the best-loved English translations . Remarkably , however , it is not based on the original German version , but on an 1816 French version . Regardless of which version one reads , abridged versions sacrifice much of the charm of the original . The longer versions are eloquent , descriptive , and employ vocabulary and language that makes them far more satisfying than most contemporary condensed versions . Given that the original author was a Swiss pastor , it 's not surprising to find the narrative soaked with implicit Christian influences . There are frequent references to God 's providence , commendation into God 's care , keeping the day of rest , as well as the encouragement of Christian morals . The exercise and promotion of Christian virtue is a clear theme , evident especially in a final scene where the father charges his sons to be faithful as Christians . \" In a long conversation with my sons I solemnly charged them with the future responsibilities of their life , in all its varied aspects , of duty towards God , their fellow men , and themselves , pointing out the temptations to which their different characters were likely to expose them , and exhorting them affectionately to hold fast to the faith in which they had been brought up . \" The boys all have different strengths and weaknesses , and Wyss presents this as a moral lesson for his readers : \" Children are , on the whole , very much alike everywhere , and you four lads fairly represent multitudes , who are growing up in all directions . It will make me happy to think that my simple narrative may lead some of these to observe how blessed are the results of patient continuance in well - doing , what benefits arise from the thoughtful application of knowledge and science , and how good and pleasant a thing it is when brethren dwell together in unity , under the eyes of parental love . \" The importance of a wholesome Christian family working together is very central : \" And my great wish is that young people who read this record of our lives and adventures , should learn from it how admirably suited is the peaceful , industrious and pious life of a cheerful and united family , to the formation of strong , pure and manly character . \" The island proves to be a form of idyllic paradise , where animals from every continent around the world apparently co-exist in a rather impossible manner ( Australian kangaroos and platypuses , Antarctic penguins , African lions and elephants , North American wolves , and bears , South American boa constrictors , not to mention walruses , tapirs , toucans , flamingos and ostriches ) . New species of plants and animals are conveniently discovered on a daily basis , and the Wyss family appears to have an inexhaustible knowledge of how to use these resources to create their own civilization . They are little troubled by sickness , storms or strife , and have few difficulties in taming nearly every animal known to mankind . They are able to cook every delicacy ever conceived . Whether their menu offers truffles or turtle , roasted bear - paw or buffalo , the food is always good and the meat never burnt . In fact their success sometimes becomes rather repetitive and tiresome , and is evidently rooted in an overly optimistic view of mankind and faith in the possibilities offered by scientific knowledge . But rather than become too frustrated by the utopianism , you should suspend your sense of disbelief and enjoy the ride . Certainly it is rather hard to believe that a Swiss pastor can immediately recognize a Myrica cerifera when he sees one and conveniently knows that its berries can be melted and strained to make candles , or that he knows that a sturgeon 's bladder can be used to make isinglass , or that he remembers intricate details about Italian , Indian and South American practices of agriculture and animal husbandry . The production of chinaware , porcelain , soap , and rubber boots and the apparent skills in taxidermy and other exotic abilities may at times be hard to swallow . And the endless discoveries and conquests of nature are rather repetitive . But in the end it 's enjoyable . It 's little wonder that the Wyss family decided not to leave their \" New Switzerland \" at the end . For the same reason , so many people come back to the Robinson 's island time and again . Some of the ideas in this book are certainly dated , but this book has stood the test of time , and spending time with the Swiss Family Robinson will continue to be rewarding ."}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

The first Vicky Bliss novel , Borrower of the Night , was written in 1973 . Vicky was working at a small Midwestern College where she was an overworked and underpaid History teacher trying to fend off marriage proposals from Tony whose major redeeming quality was that he was taller than her . Tony arrogantly challenges Vicky to find a mysterious wooden sculpture that disappeared during the wars in the 1500s claiming he will prove that he is better than her at sleuthing and then she will certainly want to marry him . They head off to Rothenburg , Germany where the Schloss Drachenstein has been turned into a hotel . They are joined by very rich antiques collector George Nolan not a man known for his honesty . The three enter into competition to find the legendary wood carving by Riemenschneider . The castle is run by the cute little Irma Drachenstein . Every creepy old castle must have an odd relative and this one has not only Irma 's Aunt but also a rich old lady who is interested in the spirit world . The book introduces one of my favorite characters of all time , Dr. Anton Schmidt , who runs a museum in Munich . The book proceeds to throw everything you could ever want with a spooky castle as a setting . There is a heroine who is scared of something , s\u00e9ances , secret rooms , attacking suits of armor , and enough crosses and double crosses to keep you guessing as to who is on which side . It is a great start to the series . Street of Five Moons finds Vicky working for the delightful Dr. Schmidt in Munich . The roly - poly Herr Doktor Schmidt fashions himself as a great detective with Vicky as his Watson . When a dead man is found with no identification , a cryptic note with an address of 37 Street of Five Moons in Rome , and a forgery of a necklace with the original dating to Charlemagne 's time that is good enough to fool experts Schmidt decides that they need to solve the mystery . Actually Vicky needs to solve the mystery for Schmidt and away she goes to visit Rome . Vicky believes that the whole thing is a wild goose chase but decides to break into the antique store at 37 Street of Five Moons . There she runs into Caesar a Doberman watchdog that falls in love with her . She also finds evidence that there is a major swindle going on in the antiques world where brilliantly made fakes are taking the place of antique jewelry . Vicky meets the enigmatic Englishman Sir John Smythe the next day at the antique store and her life will never be the same . This book also has a great castle belonging to an Italian Count that is supposed to be haunted . It turns out that Sir John is the private secretary to the Count . Of course Vicky ends up at the castle and the book has all the proper elements to make it a perfect mystery . There are ghosts , a formidable grandmother , a mistress , a disturbed son , servants who are not what they seem , dungeons , and we ca n't forget an Italian Princess . It is good fun . In Silhouette in Scarlet Vicky is lured to Sweden by John Smythe . Vicky is irritated that Symthe has left her in the lurch before to pay hotel bills while he has snuck out to avoid being arrested . Vicky blows Smyth 's cover at the airport and proceeds to go off on her own . She meets Leif who tries to woo her at the same time getting information on Smythe while claiming to work for a Special Police Branch dealing with antiquities . She also meets the very creepy Max whose hobby is making silhouettes of people out of black paper . Vicky believes that John is up to something that deals with a fifth century chalice that was found in a farmer 's field in the late 1800s . The chalice was believed to come from the loot of Viking raiders . Vicky is contacted by rich elderly farmer named Gustav Jonsson who claims to be a distant relative of hers . It is no coincidence that he owns the farm where the chalice was found . Vicky suspects that the man is being hoodwinked and decides to go visit and talk to him in person . Naturally she meets John up there and they are surprised by a criminal gang the next day who want to dig up the farmer 's land in search of more treasure . The mystery makes good use of an island that is cut off and some very nasty villains . In Trojan Gold Vicky receives a mysterious package that contains a photograph of a woman wearing jewelry that was stolen by the Nazis and disappeared during the fall of Berlin . Other experts who are friends of Vicky 's have also received a picture but not exactly the same one . When Vicky starts investigating she discovers that the same friends who attended an archeological conference in a small town the previous year are back . Vicky 's photograph has come from the innkeeper of the inn where they stayed . The inn is now run by the man 's young widow . He had been struck down by a hit and run driver . Where there is illegal treasure of course there is John Smyth . Dr. Schmidt has decided to take a personal interest in the case and help solve the mystery . It is a rich mixture of people who are all hoping to find the treasure for their own museums , a young widow who is obviously frightened , a hot headed cousin of the widow , and a mastermind who could be just about anybody . Instead of a castle this time we get an abandoned church and a lonely graveyard . Being winter in the Alps around Christmas we also get avalanches . This mystery has a lot of red herrings and is a bit confusing at times but still is enjoyable in the end . Night Train to Memphis is the best book in the series . Vicky is asked by Interpol to infiltrate a luxury cruise in Egypt and look over the passengers and see if she can identify a criminal that they believe is about to pull off a big heist at the Egyptian Museum . Vicky is promised protection and that there will be no danger to her . She is shocked when she realizes that John is aboard the ship but not nearly as shocked as when she finds out that he has a brand new and very young bride . Of course the only crook Vicky recognizes is her former lover . Vicky 's fellow travelers include a very flaky mystery writer , Sweet and Bright and odd couple team where only Sweet talks , a charming multi-millionaire who is about to make a very large donation to Egyptian archeology , a very boring professor whose lectures are a cure for insomnia , her former flame and his wife and his mother , a ditzy widow looking for a new rich husband , and sweet little lady who has more in common with Vicky then she realizes . Of course Vicky 's boss Dr. Schmidt shows up to make life difficult as Vicky tries to keep him safe and he tries to insinuate himself in the case . Dr. Schmidt 's new passion is for Country and Western music . This book is treasure for people who love Country and Western music with its references and clues based on the music . Vicky finds new enemies as well as some old ones who are not in jail as she had thought . There are again crosses and double - crosses and people who are not what they seem . Schmidt has a rather large role in this book which is a delight as he is one of my favorite characters of all time . Elizabeth Peters did a final book to close the Vicky Bliss series called The Laughter of Dead Kings . It is probably my least favor of the books . I got the sense that she knew she had to wrap up some things . In her introduction she did mention that in this story she was kind of stuck because of the length of time between books . After talking things over with fellow writers she decided to put the story in the \u201c current now . \u201d In other words she got to play God with her universe and creations and Vicky is still in her early thirties and using modern technology . The story takes place again in Egypt about 6 months or so from the events of Night Train to Memphis . In the story someone has stolen the mummy of King Tutankhamun . All clues lead to Vicky 's lover John Smythe who now goes by his real name of Tregarth . John swears his innocence and he and Vicky proceed to try and find the real thief . They are joined along the way by people from others books . Schmidt again has a large and funny part . We also meet Suzy and Feisal who were in Night Train to Memphis and Jan Perlmutter from Trojan Gold . The story drags a bit but I urge you to make it through to the end . There is a bit there that had me laughing so hard the first time I read it . I do n't care if the story was a set up for Elizabeth Peter 's ending it is worth the ride . Rest is peace lovely lady we will miss your flair and your humor . Readers & Book Lovers Series Schedule"}, "valid_source": true, "bool_generated": false}

No one has lived here for nearly 60 years , and the public is banned from its 628 acres . Now , after spending $ 100,000 on a 15 - year plan for Nomans Land , federal officials want it to stay that way . The Fish & Wildlife Service has recommended that Nomans Land be protected as federal wilderness , meaning that if the public wants a glimpse of this National Wildlife Refuge , options could be limited to a virtual tour on the Web or a magnifying scope on the Vineyard . The island , used as an aerial bombing range from 1943 to 1996 , is pocked with unexploded munitions that make one of Southern New England 's last wild places a potentially deadly hazard . \u201c I think it 's important to have a few places that are completely prohibited from the public , '' said Stephanie Koch , a US Fish & Wildlife Service biologist , who walked the beach at Nomans Land recently in search of a piping plover nest . \u201c I know that 's a hard sell for a lot of people . '' It 's also a reality that four Navy sweeps of the island since 1997 have not altered . Although munitions have been found , defused , and removed from the surface , an undetermined amount of bombs lie underground and undetected . \u201c The result could be catastrophic , '' Koch said of public access to Nomans Land . But this nightmare for human visitors is a blessing for its avian guests . Due to its undisturbed nature and shortage of predators , Nomans Land is an important stop on the Atlantic Flyway for songbirds migrating south as far as South America . Northern harriers , oystercatchers , roseate terns , catbirds , double - crested cormorants , and even piping plovers are a few of the many species that the Fish & Wildlife Service monitors in roughly six visits to the island each year . A few stone walls remain from homes and farms that once dotted the island , and a small family cemetery lies perilously close to an eroding 20 - foot cliff on the northern shore . Otherwise , Nomans Land is a deserted place . \u201c When I 'm out here , this feels as much like wilderness as any other place I 've been in New England , '' said Koch , as she savored a 360 - degree ocean view from the island 's 110 - foot summit . To that end , the Fish & Wildlife Service has recommended that Nomans Land be protected , which would preserve its natural , minimally managed solitude . Another option , which the service has offered but not recommended , would maintain the current oversight , which provides slightly more on - site management than for wilderness . A third possible option , among other changes , would expand federal management of Nomans , possibly clear additional trails , and develop a partnership with the Wampanoag tribe on Martha 's Vineyard that would allow limited access for cultural and ceremonial uses . Bettina Washington , historic preservation officer for the Aquinnah - based tribe , said an expanded Wampanoag connection with the island would be welcome . \u201c Our wish is , once again , at least to go over and pay our respects , '' said Washington , who has never visited Nomans Land . Wampanoag remains are believed to be buried on the island , which the tribe 's oral history says was created when Moshup , an ancestral giant , tossed a crab into the ocean . The origin of the island 's name is shrouded in mystery , but some evidence points to a reference to Tequenomans , an ancient Wampanoag sachem . Bartholomew Gosnold , an English explorer , sighted the island in 1602 , and more than three centuries of habitation followed until the Crane family sold Nomans Land to the Navy in 1952 . The island , nominally part of the Town of Chilmark , was transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1998 . The danger of buried munitions has led to fishing restrictions , as well as the ban on public access . Still , two unauthorized visitors walked the island after they anchored offshore . Roger Hoffman praised the beauty of the place . \u201c It 's a privilege to see it , '' Hoffman told Koch as they passed on an inland trail . That privilege , however , led to a $ 100 fine levied by a Fish & Wildlife Service officer . The 15 - year proposal for Nomans Land is among the plans required for National Wildlife Refuges across the country , Koch said , and will be finalized this fall before being submitted to the Northeast regional director of the Fish & Wildlife Service . After approval , Nomans Land almost certainly will remain an enigma to the public . \u201c It really does feel like you 're on your own island , '' said Jason St. Sauver , a biologist who visited recently . \u201c It feels like no one 's been out there for hundreds of years .

Directed with a pop-ish sensibility by Laurent Tirard ( Le Petit Nicolas ) , this effects - heavy , 3D-outfitted installment\u2013in which the mighty Gallic duo bring their magic and mustaches across the channel to save the Queen from Cesar 's army \u2013features a few decent gags and non-sequiturs amid an otherwise redundant storyline that begins to waver by the second act , and then just keeps on coming . With a purported budget of \u20ac 60 million ( $ 78 million ) and a cast of French film heavyweights including G\u00e9rard Depardieu , Catherine Deneuve and Dany Boon , Britannia should see big numbers in all Francophone territories , although they wo n't reach the heights of 2002 's Mission Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre , which remains both the best and highest domestic grosser of the bunch . The Bottom Line The mighty Gallic franchise dishes out a few solid laughs amid an overstretched , effects - laden adventure . Alongside Herg\u00e9's Tintin , writer / illustrator Ren\u00e9 Goscinny and artist Albert Uderzo 's Asterix series is undoubtedly the most beloved bande dessin\u00e9e in French history , with 300 - hundred - plus million copies of the 34 - book series sold in dozens of different languages , and three previous movies raking in a combined total of 30 - plus million local admissions . There 's even a national Asterix theme park , which , like its titular hero , has tried its best over the years to thwart an ongoing alien invasion ( in this case , by Mickey Mouse and the folks at Disneyland Paris ) . Based on Asterix in Britain and Asterix and the Normans , the scenario \u2014 co - written with Tirard regular Gr\u00e9goire Vigneron \u2014 takes a few cues from Alain Chabat 's Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre as it follows Asterix ( Edouard Baer , the third actor to take on the role after Clovis Cornillac and Christian Clavier ) and Obelix ( series stalwart Depardieu ) from their isolated enclave in Brittany to the heart of England circa 50 B.C. , where reigning Queen Cordelia ( Deneuve ) is hoping the two Gauls will rescue her nation from a siege by Julius Cesar ( Luchini ) and his army . Along the way , the Frenchies cross paths with an uptight Brit ( Guillaume Gallienne ) , his undersexed wife ( Charlotte Le Bon ) and their over - anal servant ( Val\u00e9rie Lemercier ) , resulting in lots of cultural clashes and commentaries on the age - old cross - Channel rivalry . Indeed , many \u2014 way too many \u2014 of the jokes here involve the various French cast members speaking their native language with ridiculous British accents ( an effect that will be lost on non- French speaking viewers ) , and while some such gags work initially , the film overstretches them across 110 minutes of action that , like the Romans surrounding Cordelia 's fort , winds up turning in circles . The bits involving a squad of invading Vikings ( the \u201c Normans \u201d ) are especially tedious and over - the -top , even if there are a few brief instances of cleverness , such as a scene where a Norman fighter ( Dany Boon ) is subjected to a Clockwork Orange - style lesson in English manners . Otherwise , Tirard and cinematographer Denis Rouden ( A Gang Story ) offer up lots of candy - colored set pieces \u2014 such as an ancient version of London called Londinium \u2014 and plenty of gorgeous landscapes in a continent - hopping co-production that shot in Hungary , Ireland and Malta . Visual effects by Mac Guff and supervisor Kevin Berger ( Days of Glory ) are tongue- in - cheek in the spirit of the original comics , adding panache to a movie that has a very hard time maintaining interest through the final standoff . Baer ( Chicken With Plums ) manages to dish out a few witty one - liners and tends to underplay things , while Depardieu is truly larger than life as the all - powerful Obelix , sporting a pair of XXXXL striped pants that he wears up to his neckline . But the real star here may be Vincent Lacoste ( Les Beaux Gosses ) , who winningly portrays a blas\u00e9 teenager completely indifferent to the ongoing antics \u2014 best reflecting how much this waning franchise needs a boost of young talent to stay fresh . Projection at the Paris screening caught was a bit on the dim side , while the 3D itself seemed both harmless and superfluous . Although Britannia officially opens October 17 , it premiered last week at the Dinard Film Festival and is currently being publicly previewed in theatres throughout France .

This review contains spoilers . 3.5 Amber 31422 I have three words for the latest Fringe episode , and they 're all ' brilliant ' . Season three has moved gracefully , like a big cat stalking its prey , from the outset , playing a flipside game where we cleverly alternate between our universe and an alternate one where Olivia is currently resident . Amber 31422 takes place entirely in the alternate universe , where Olivia , having been convinced she 's from that dimension , is starting to guess that maybe she 's been manipulated to think that . As such , Peter only appears as a figment of her subconscious , continually prodding her in the right direction , while helping her solve a mystery to prove his credentials . The conundrum in question revolves around the weird amber chemical that is used to plug holes in the fabric of space and time in the altiverse , which can trap people in its matrix . The revealing opening sequence shows that anyone caught in the amber is n't dead , and can be revived if removed from it . This is n't something that the government wants to become public , so the alternate Fringe agents must track down a man removed from it before that happens . Enough of telling you the plot , what 's so good about this story ? Well , they 've got the Ashmore brothers , Shawn and Aaron ( Shawn was Bobby in X - Men ) to play two identical brothers , one who got caught in the amber and another who got him out . They 're both rather good actors , but also the way that 's it 's revealed that the one they think was in the amber is actually the one who gets him out is a nice twist that 's cleverly played . This is also a nice analogy for Olivia 's situation , where two identical people have exchanged places . I wo n't talk about where this ultimately goes , but it 's actually more about where it takes Olivia 's character that 's truly interesting . She agrees to undergo some experiments to better understand how she can move between universes , but this presents a whole boatload of unanswered questions . If she can move between universes , then why does n't she just flip back to ours ? Are the drugs she 's taking designed to stop that happening ? We must know more ! But I must go back to the old nugget : how did Altivia make the journey over , if she does n't have this ability ? There 's something anchoring her to this universe , which she can only break briefly . It 's also interesting that when she travels between the two locations she arrives in the same physical location ( under the Statue of Liberty ) , as she was in the alternate dimension . What it also tries to do is give us a better perspective on Walternate , and his motivation in creating Amber 31422 in his personal battle against the destruction of his reality . I find it fascinating that his personality is not remotely like Walter , except he 's still a mad scientist at heart , even if he 's not insane in the same fashion . What I also know is that the next story is set in our universe , which is slightly disappointing news , because I want to know what happens next to Olivia in this one ! That said , it 's indicative of how well season three is going that I 'm gripped by the need to know what happens next . On a less positive note , I 've noticed that the show hit a season low for viewers , which , given how good it 's been , does n't make much sense to this reviewer . The only problem that I can see with the direction they 've taken Fringe this year , focusing on the altiverse story arc , is that if you were n't a fan beforehand , you 'll not be able to follow what 's going on now . For those of us that did step onto the Fringe elevator early , it 's a great ride , but I can see that it 's a difficult proposition to attract new viewers . Let 's hope the slide is at least halted , because I 'd be crushed if they 're forced to wrap up this well crafted narrative because of cancellation .

His three sons laid him to rest next to his father in accordance with his last wishes . Mr Egal , 80 , died in South Africa on Friday while undergoing surgery at a military hospital . The self - declared republic of Somaliland broke away from the rest of Somalia in 1991 . Mr Egal was elected president in 1993 but the break - away republic was never recognised by the international community . Holy words Around 4,000 people attended the funeral , an eye-witness told the BBC 's Hassan Barise in the Somali capital , Mogadishu by telephone . The governments of Ethiopia and Djibouti were represented , said businessman Abdullahi Aden Hirsi . The Ethiopian delegation was led by the deputy minister of foreign affairs . Our correspondent says that Ethiopia is trying to divide Somalia and supports Somaliland 's independence , while Djibouti is pushing for Somali unity . Mr Egal 's long time opponents , Suleman Gal and Ahmed Silanyo , were also there . The vice- president of Somaliland , Dahir Riyale Kahin , was inaugurated as the new leader on Friday . Although seven days of national mourning have been declared , our correspondent says that flags are not flying at half - mast because the emblem includes holy Islamic words . Power-struggle Mr Egal , who had been undergoing treatment for a number of ailments - ranging from rheumatism and hypertension to diabetes and cancer - died from what are described as complications following surgery . Mohamed Egal had just had his term of office extended for another year in a final bid to secure the international recognition he craved . Somaliland managed to avoid the descent into anarchy seen in the rest of Somalia but our correspondent says that Mr Egal 's death raises fears of a power - struggle and possible instability . Mr Kahin comes from the Gudabirsi clan , whereas Mr Egal was a member of Somaliland 's dominant Issak clan .

Biker gangs have made the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally a violence - marred affair in the past . The rally , which draws about half a million people each August to the Black Hills in western South Dakota , has since gotten older , laid - back and more diverse . This year , gunshots about 75 miles away reminded attendees about the gangs . Authorities said two men affiliated with the Hells Angels shot and wounded five Outlaws Motorcycle Club members in Custer State Park earlier this week . Suzanne Church , who has ministered to biker gang members at Sturgis since 1997 , said she hopes there 's no more violence . \" We hate to see people die and go to hell , \" she said . The rally attracts bikers of all walks of life , who ride throughout the Black Hills , a patch of forest and valleys 100 miles long and 50 miles wide on South Dakota 's western edge . Sturgis , a town of about 7,000 , is on the northern edge of the Hills , while Custer State Park is in the south . Some Hells Angels members own land near Sturgis , so the gang has a presence at every rally , said Jim Bush , Sturgis police chief . Law enforcement officers knew that hundreds of Outlaws members planned to gather at a rented southern Hills campground , Bush said . The Outlaws are one of the nation 's four largest motorcycle gangs , along with the Hells Angels , Pagans and Bandidos . The Outlaws have chapters in 20 states , Europe , Canada and Australia . A posting on its Web site said law enforcement agencies were informed of the group 's plans to attend Sturgis . It said : \" We are not going there to makes any type of statement , or display of power . We are simply going there to enjoy the Sturgis venue , see the historical sights and spend time withour Brothers . \" Authorities have their own term for the gangs . \" We classify these organizations as crime syndicates , \" said Bernard Zapor , special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives field office in St. Paul , Minn . The last major violence involving motorcycle gangs during the Sturgis rally was in 1990 , when a Sons of Silence member shot an Outlaws gang member during a bar brawl in which two other Sons of Silence members were stabbed . \" They have not changed , \" Bush said of the major gangs . \" They 're as organized and involved in crime as they ever have been . \" It was one of only a few major rally - related incidents of violence , Bush said . The only other gang arrests have been three or four members picked up for unrelated crime , he said . \" They usually get along pretty good , \" Bush said . In Tuesday 's shooting , Chad John Wilson , 30 , of Lynnwood , Wash . , and John James Midmore , 32 , of Valparaiso , Ind. , face five counts of attempted first-degree murder . A judge set bond Thursday at $ 5 million each . One victim was still in critical condition at Rapid City Regional Hospital on Thursday . Another was in stable condition at a Sioux Falls hospital , said Sara Rabern of the South Dakota Attorney General 's office . On Main Street in Sturgis , a few people wearing Hells Angels vests and T-shirts were spotted at the 66th annual rally , which ends Sunday . The gang runs a vendor table that sells club pins , T-shirts , bumper stickers and other items . None of three men staffing the table wanted to discuss the shooting . A worker at a tattoo shop down the street that the gang runs also refused comment . Jim Vlahakis , state Division of Criminal Investigation director , said more than 300 Outlaws members representing 119 different chapters have been seen in the area , along with 80 to 100 Hells Angels members . Vlahakis said authorities plan to meet with the two gangs to \" try to head off any potential problems \" but had not done so as of Thursday . Officers were prepared to respond to gang violence , Bush said , adding that eventual retaliation is likely . \" It may not happen here , \" Bush said . \" It could happen a month from now \" somewhere else . ___ On the Net : Outlaws : http://www.outlawsmc.com/ Hells Angels : http://www.hells-angels.com/ Copyright 2006 The Associated Press .

I heard about it from Phil Jupitus ' twitterings . I 'd hastily followed him before I realised it was THE Phil Jupitus , dur ! The idea was brilliant - ish and was for everyone to get hold of and watch a really bad movie called The Happening ( trust me it is really bloody awful ) and after all hitting PLAY at 9 PM everyone would be free to use the \u201c # badmovieclub \u201d hashtag whilst twittering . The experience was hilarious . Some people had clicked play a few seconds early and were spoiling the film for the rest of us . I spent most of my time reading the comments rather than watching the film and giggling at the tweets which were automatically refreshed if you used Tweet Deck to automatically show anything ( see below ) . The actual experience of course could have been better , there were far too many people tweeting at once , it was almost impossible to keep up with the fire - hose flood of tweets , some of which were n't very good - such as the endless \u201c EXPOSITION ! \u201d heckling but despite all that I loved it . It was like going to see a film in a cinema where the audience are guaranteed to be rowdy , which for most films would be your worst nightmare but for some films , this approach is perfect . I know it 's as corny as bees but I felt like I was part of something , which for a medium which is becoming increasingly fragmentary as people simply do n't get together to watch anything . But the really important thing , for me , was that Graham has shown us with a simple experiment a perfect prototype for what video content such as films , football matches and even education could be . This is the future and it 's a future where the asynchronous , such as DVDs and YouTube videos and films you 've downloaded can be re-synchronized with the added goodness of the juice of real people . Imagine \u2026 what it would be like to watch a really bad film , only instead of having to use a different application the tweets appeared nicely overlaying the film - that 'd be sexy . Now imagine if you could limit the tweets to just people you follow , that would cut out a lot of noise . But it may cut out too much noise , so let 's maybe let through tweets from people outside our immediate circle of friends that have been thumbs - upped by their friends , this might just let the funny ones through . Or maybe , what if you received tweets at a certain rate , so that if your friends were n't commenting on the film then \u201c outsiders \u201d tweets would bleed through . Now imagine you were late to the party and were watching the film on Saturday , that need n't matter because you could still see the film with tweets because they have all been time - synch - ed with the film . So , not only will it feel like a synchronous experience , you can add to it in a way that the person hopelessly late to the party on Sunday can still enjoy ( and contribute to ) . Now imagine , that someone writes a search engine that searches for \u201c bees \u201d or \u201c cheese and crackers \u201d that simply assumes what people are tweeting about whilst watching a film ( no matter how you do it ) has something to do with what 's going on onscreen ( even if it 's just a piss - take ) . Then , we have a means of gathering really messy meta data about a film and become able to search it ( or link to it ) textually for the first time . There would be groups of film buffs collaboratively adding the dialogue to \u201c the classics \u201d just as people pitch in and help with mapping streets for the open source community in no time . Film courses would create a meta-layer where they offer their commentary on a film \u201c just look at the camera angles used here \u201d and you can watch it and here 's the good bit , even if you do n't have access to the movie but do have access to tools like BitTorrent . Imagine a group of comedians being assembled to \u201c watch and comment \u201d on a film . I 'd pay to be able to switch on the layer that made the film funnier . Imagine a pair of glasses that did that for a romantic film you really did n't want to watch , I do n't know many blokes who would n't pay for a pair of those \u2026 with earplugs . The next step this experiment needs to take is to create a software player that can play stuff from wherever ( YouTube , DVD , hard disk , stream ) and that hooks into twitter . It 's not hard to do and then you 'd be able to layer comments on a film , and then choose to filter those comments to just friends or just film buffs or even \u201c selected hilarious tweets \u201d from Graham himself . The important bit is that the movie industry do n't need to know about it , we do n't need their permission or copyright to share time - coded knob jokes and if people are watching the film in a cinema , playing a legal DVD or an illegal download does n't make any difference . All that matters is the people , the timing and the quality of the gag . So there , The Happening was awful , great fun and massively important - you should 've been there - it was the future of film \u2026 ish . Responses - Twitter , Growl , Boosh !

More than 10 years work has seen James Cook University Research Fellow Dr Mark Norman discover more than 150 new species of the eight - armed creature , 45 in Australian waters alone . Indeed the work of this detective of the deep has proved a big hit with international documentary makers . Two new nature films exploring his work are to air overseas within the next few months . Brisbane reporter John Taylor interviewed Dr Mark Norman about what it is he finds so fascinating about the octopus . JOHN TAYLOR : Next week marks the 30th anniversary of man setting foot on the moon . But while we can explore another celestial body , we still really do n't know what we 're sharing our own planet with . The work of James Cook University Marine Biologist , Dr Mark Norman , is proof of that . In over 10 years of researching octopuses , Dr Mark Norman and his team have found more than 150 species of octopuses around the world that no - one knew were there . In fact , he 's doubled the number of known octopuses . Forty - five of them were in Australian waters and what he 's found is startling . MARK NORMAN : It 's not like they 'd be easily missed . Some of them are 3 metre arm spans and 10 kilograms with , you know , suckers the size of golf balls and all that sort of stuff and it was just a case of not looking in the right places at the right time , I suppose . JOHN TAYLOR : He 's found most of these weird critters , as he calls them , in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans , and off Southern Australia . MARK NORMAN : They come in all sorts of shapes and sizes . We 've got pygmies that sit on your finger nail and are fully mature at under one gram . We 've got things with really long , spaghetti-like arms with 2 metre arm spans , like daddy long leg spiders that run around on sand and mud surfaces , and we 've got other ones that drop their arms like drop-tailed lizards , and some are hairy and look like little bushes walking around . I suppose the most amazing thing about octopuses is their capacity to change colour and to change shape , so we 've got ones that can go from dark chocolate brown and dead smooth to be a spiky , cream coloured seaweed to move on and then be a mottled coloured piece of coral . And probably the most exciting animal we 've seen in recent times is one we 've nicknamed the \" mimic octopus \" which is actually mimicking other poisonous animals so it 's impersonating sea snakes and some poisonous flounders and line fish . That 's where we 've been getting some of the interest from film crews . JOHN TAYLOR : Interest indeed . Dr Norman and his work have been the subject now of four international nature films , two of which are due to be released soon . But it is any wonder there 's such interest when the biggest octopus he 's found weighs up to 200 kilograms with an 8 metre arm span . MARK NORMAN : The octopus is probably the sneaky predators and that 's why not many people have had much experience with them . They tend to be either super camouflaged if they 're out during the day or the ones that come out at night just do it all under the cover of darkness . So , we 've been to lots of places where people say oh , I 've lived here 20 years and I 've never seen an octopus and we 'll do a drive under their local pier and see 20 in a dive . So , I think it 's ... their main issue is they have no armour , they have no spikes , they have no skeleton , so they 're basically a meal walking around , sort of a whole pile of meat walking around , so to stop them being eaten by any passing shark or fish they have to be really clever and sneaky and do complex behaviours or mimic things or camouflage or squirt ink or do all sorts of things . So , most people 's experience with octopus is a chewy bit on a pizza or something like that . When you watch these things wandering around in their natural environments , they 're kind of like watching martians wandering around . It 's just a spectacular behaviour . JOHN TAYLOR : Dr Norman says he 's learnt through his long experience there is no such thing as a stereo typical octopus , but one thing that he is increasingly finding puzzling is why the Australian fishing industry has n't cottoned on to the octopuses ' money making potential . MARK NORMAN : Small countries off West Africa export up to 50,000 tonnes of octopus a year , reaping them hundreds of millions of dollars worth of income each year . We export 72 tonnes of octopus a year and yet we 've got the greatest diversity and one of the highest number of octopuses in the world in Australian waters .

Background One Canadian volunteer 's story of training in minor landing craft operations during WW2 . Thousands of landing craft of many different types , broadly categorised as minor and major according to size , were deployed on D Day . To operate these flat bottomed craft , with their challenging sailing characteristics , required a well trained force of Navy personnel . Their primary task was to safely deliver hundreds of thousands of troops and their equipment onto unimproved landing beaches against entrenched enemy positions - a crucial prerequisite to the opening of the long awaited second front in the west . [ Photo ; Kendal Kidder 's war medals and the now inscribed stone he gathered from a Normandy beach nearly 40 years after his first visit . The medals are ( bottom left to right ) : The France and Germany Star ; The Africa Star ; The Italy Star ; The 1939 - 1945 Star ; The Victory Medal ; Canadian Volunteer Service Medal with clasp for Overseas Service and The Defence Medal . ] Kendal Kidder 's light hearted and often humerous account belies the reality of his experiences in North Africa , Sicily , Italy and Normandy . The stone he recovered from a Normandy beach is inscribed Arromanches , NORMANDY , 6 June 1944 , K Kidder , 8 10 1983 ( ? ) . His son , John Kidder recalled , \" Dad picked up the pebble from the beach at Arromanches when we travelled en famille to France in 1983 for my sister 's wedding . It was one of the very few times , perhaps the only time , that I ever saw him cry . \" Over 4,000 landing craft of many types and sizes were required for the invasion of Europe , which became known as D-Day . Every one had a unique role to play . Their design and operating techniques were constantly under review , as feedback from training exercises and operational experience was assimilated . A large training base for minor landing craft training was set up at Inveraray in the west of Scotland . It was named ' The No 1 Combined Training Centre ' , of which HMS Quebec was the naval component . The task was to train the expanding army invasion force with training in the latest amphibious landing techniques , including embarkation and disembarkation onto the landing beaches . The Navy and Royal Marine crews for the landing craft also needed training in seamanship and the operation of the various minor landing craft . There was an acute shortage of Royal Navy manpower for the latter , so Canada provided 60 officers and 300 men for training under the Combined Operations Command , a significant part of which was at Inveraray . The Canadian Navy insisted that the men be kept together as a Canadian unit ' attached Royal Navy ' and not posted individually among Royal Navy Combined Ops personnel . These men worked together throughout the war , forming strong bonds of friendship and loyalty , which continued in the post war years . This is the story of Kendall ' Happy ' Kidder 's training for war , taken from the testimony of his friends and shipmates , his letters to family members and the recollections of his wife Jill . Officer Training It was April 21 , 1941 , when Kendall became Probationary Sub Lieutenant Kidder in the Royal Canadian Navy Volunteer Reserve . His application had , however , not been plain sailing . A rather fussy Navy Recruitment Officer , on learning that Kendall was born in Mogollen , New Mexico , a small mining town where his father had been working at the time , gave him the address of the Air Force recruiting station with the encouraging information that \" they will take anybody . \" However , with a bit of perseverance , he was later assured that his name would be added to the Navy list of those with officer potential on completion of the appropriate form . [ Jake Warren ] [ Photo ; A team of Canadian sailors ( stokers ) taking part in a Tug -of - War game during the sports day of HMCS NIOBE , Greenock , Scotland . In the background are spectators and a PT instructor as the official . \u00a9 IWM ( A 17260 ) . ] Kendall was somewhat taken aback when the form he was given was for an able seaman . The authorities apparently regarded him as a mere landsman , without any seafaring background or experience . So , with a little bit of imagination , some vacation experience in surveying and prospecting up north was transformed into ' extensive experience with small craft in inland waters . ' It worked ! By the fall , Kendall attended the officer training establishment at Royal Roads on Vancouver Island . Recruitment had been stepped up a few gears to meet the demands of both the Canadian and British Navies . There were 125 officers in each intake with an average age of 22 . The training period of about 4 months included navigation , small boat handling , gunnery , seamanship etc . War seemed a long way off until the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour on December 7th , 1941 . For a while , rumours abounded that the Japanese were invading the west coast of Canada , resulting in the issue of some .45 rifles ' to repel boarders . ' Hazardous Mission Around this time , Commander Grant called twenty of us into his office . We were all single ; the oldest was thirty . He told us that officers and men were needed for service overseas in what he described as a ' hazardous mission . ' Fourteen volunteers were required from among the officer cadets at Royal Roads . Anyone not interested , for whatever reason , would be excused without any blemish on his record . Two dropped out for family reasons . Slips containing the names of the remainder were placed in a hat and fourteen volunteers were chosen at random . As I understand it , a similar process was carried out at King 's College in Halifax , where another group of sub-lieutenants were taking their training . A total of twenty - eight officers were thus selected , including Kendall . [ Bill Sinclair ] By February 1942 , Kendall was in Halifax , Nova Scotia , awaiting passage to Scotland and an uncertain future .... We arrived here last Saturday night and reported on Sunday morning . I did quite a bit of shopping , bought a new pair of boots and had my old ones fixed , got a new strap for my watch , besides a hundred and one other things . Your Christmas parcel was here when I arrived and it was grand to have a second Christmas . The train ride from Montreal to here is anything but a pleasure and this miserable town is anything but an enticing goal . I have never seen filth to equal it . We have n't as yet been able to find a room or even get a chance to live in barracks , so we are living in a much too expensive hotel . We have n't any idea when we will be leaving but it ca n't come any too quickly to suit me . For the last three days we have been doing PT ( physical training ) for three hours every afternoon , at this point every muscle in my body is very sore and very stiff . My address here is : Nelson Barracks , Fleet Mail Office . [ Kendall Kidder in letter to parents . ] At Halifax , the officers and men from Royal Roads met their counterparts from ' Kings ' and were briefed on what lay ahead . The ' hazardous duty ' , for which the men had volunteered , was Combined Operations , whose primary mission was to plan and train for the invasion of Europe by amphibious landings . This scenario proved accurate when the nature of Kendall 's training became known . Churchill was the prime mover in setting up the Combined Operations Command to ensure the three services worked closely together as a unified force , where inter-service communication and cooperation would be strengthened and inter-service rivalry avoided , thus producing a much more effective invading force . Combined Operations The name could not be better , for although clad in blue and paid by the Senior Service , nearly all the work is with the Army . It is very difficult to tell where the Navy leaves off and the Army takes on . On approaching an opposed beach , the Navy and Army officers together have to decide whether it is advisable to land or not and each thinks of the other 's problems before coming to a decision . Our work entails not only landing Commando and Assault troops but also tanks , guns , heavy lorries , jeeps , ammunition , gas , water , and many supplies . So we deal with every branch of the Army . [ Ian Barclay . ] Training bases for ' minor ' landing craft were set up at Hayling Island on the south coast of England and at Inveraray in Scotland . The first Canadian flotillas joined the RN in January of 1942 . Kendall was posted to HMCS Niobe in Scotland on March 1 , 1942 . It was the main manning and pay depot for the Canadian Navy in the UK .... a gloomy brick building , which had been a mental hospital called the ' Smithston Poorhouse and Asylum ' , known locally as the ' loony bin ! ' [ Map ; The remote location of the No1 Combined Training Centre on Loch Fyne with the many landing beaches identified . ] Landing Craft Training There were many types of landing craft in use but Kendall would be involved with three . Landing Craft Infantry Large ( LCI L ) . Thirty of these boats were entrusted to 850 officers and crew of the RCN . They were 260 feet long with a 24 foot beam . They carried two officers , with a third during the Normandy landings , and a crew of 20 to 25 men . These ships could carry 250 fully armed soldiers , who , if necessary , could be bunked down in two shifts . [ Luke Williams . ] - Landing Craft Assault ( LCA ) . This craft was without a doubt the outstanding one of all assault craft . Extreme length about 41 feet , beam 10 feet 2 inches , draft of 1 foot aft and 9 inches forward . Its maximum carrying capacity was 35 fully equipped men , discharging them by means of a lowered ramp . The LCA at slow speeds was a most silent craft and capable of beaching without giving its position away due to noise . - Landing Craft Mechanised ( LCM ) . These craft were designed to be carried on larger ships and lowered into the sea near the destination . They were used to rush ashore equipment required by the initial assault troops . The carrying capacity 35 tons . - [ Photo ; troops going ashore in an early morning landing exercise on the shores of Loch Fyne . These landing craft was crewed by RNVR personnel attached to Combined Operations . ] The initial drafts from Canada arrived in Scotland and soon were shipped to Hayling Island east of Portsmouth for initial training in the smaller ' landing craft assault ' LCA 's , for about three weeks . Hayling Island had somewhat the same shape as Portsmouth , so , on occasions , lights in the fields were dimly lit to appear much like Portsmouth to the German bomber pilots . This ruse gave Portsmouth some relief from the daily bombing the civilians suffered . Did n't please the farmers of Hayling Island much to become the target . [ Bob Crothers . ] After this initial training , the Canadians were drafted to HMS Quebec near Inveraray on Loch Fyne in Scotland , the main Combined training establishment , where literally hundreds of thousands of Allied troops were trained . The Canadian sailors familiarised themselves with the various landing craft , while training the Army in safely embarking and disembarking onto ' hostile ' shores . This was undertaken mainly on the shores of Loch Fyne under realistic conditions , including simulated air attack by 516 Squadron . [ Photo opposite ; Hurricanes ' attacking ' a landing beach off Furnace on Loch Fyne . ] After HMS Northney on Hayling Island , we entrained for Scotland and took the MacBrayne 's paddle steamer for the tourist trip to HMS Quebec at Inveraray . There were time intervals between basic training and the more serious exercises leading up to major raids and invasions . Before these exercises , there was a pleasantly relaxed time at Quebec with light duties due to recurrent breakdowns and shortage of boats . The elastic discipline of Combined Ops kept the men together at Inveraray . We waited to learn rope tricks and cliff climbing , the threatened characteristics of Commando activity , but found they were not in our job description after all . So Quebec turned out to be a lot less demanding than we had expected . In fact quite the contrary . Time was on our hands . Some of us had tea with the Duke of Argyle , while others used ' Mill 's ' bombs to fish his salmon streams , climb his mountains and explore his deer park land . The light ' casualties ' among his sheep were suspect . Some of us had leave with all the pleasant , exciting , educating experiences of days in the British Isles . But then we were called together . For a while we had our own ships to carry our landing craft about . They were strange creations indeed . HMS Iris and HMS Daffodil were called Landing ships ( stern chutes ) . They could carry thirteen LCA ' s mounted on trolleys . The LCAs were picked up in the stern chute and hauled up onto the main deck and then , by a complicated switching system , made snug on three tracks on the covered deck . The main excitement was launching the craft by pushing them to the chute one by one and watching them race down the track and plunge into the sea , splashing up a great wall of water . Very spectacular but we could n't quite crowd out of our minds the possibility that the LCA 's would just keep on going down to Davy Jone 's locker , though it never happened to us . I dread to think what would have happened if we had to launch in rough weather .. . I believe this method of launching was later abandoned . Our LCA 's were then moored on the Ayrshire coast . We were housed in Jimmy the One huts and tents at HMS Dundonald . The pubs of the harbour were well used . Our camp was surrounded by a barbed wire fence ; some enterprising matelots found them penetrable ... Len Birkenes and others went back and forth through the fence to enjoy Scottish hospitality . The largest exercises were Schuyt 1 and Schuyt 2 manned by Combined Operations . The name picked was that of a class of agreeable small Dutch vessels carrying cargo about the peacetime European coast and waterways . A number had escaped the Nazis and now worked on the British coastline . In conception and organization , these exercises were planting the seed that matured on D-Day . The exercise troops were loaded from the mainland and great excitement was present , since the beaches would be attended by dignitaries including King George VI , Winston Churchill and our new chief , Lord Louis Mountbatten . They had assembled to witness the ' shape of things to come . ' [ A fellow officer . ] The training was perhaps less physically demanding than some officers were led to believe but there were still challenging moments when unfamiliar situations arose . The strange new world of landing craft , tides , currents , cold wind , rain and darkness beckoned those of us who were raw recruits , still getting used to the grub , currency and customs of a new land . In Scotland the heather looked lovely through the early morning mist and sun . We acquainted ourselves with further landing craft and their side effects - wetness , oil , hunger and tiredness . A strong bond was forged among this Combined Operations group of officers and ratings , which still exists today . Officers cried orders in the pitch dark as we trained . ' Keep closed up ! ' or ' Out kedge ! ' and just before hitting the beach , ' Down door ! ' and ' Up door !'. Seamen strained at the cranks on the windlass as the coxswains worked the helm and motors against unfamiliar tides and currents . We were green but learning fast . The seamen , good naturedly , accused the stokers of being seamen with their brains bashed in but those same stokers never let us down and it was sure good to have someone you could count on . No one wanted to be left stranded on the beach , nor were they . This was an unwritten law . [ Seaman Doug Harrison . ] The Canadian stokers are mentioned many times in the annals of Canadian Combined Ops , always with praise . Our craft were the various types of assault boats driven by Diesel and gasoline engines . The Canadian stokers ( mechanics ) were very adapted to this sort of work and received much praise from all those who came in contact with them . Our greatest difficulty was trying to keep them with us as , several senior officers of the Royal Navy thought they should have some of them . [ Ian Barclay . ] There were lighter moments too , as exampled by Kidder 's natural talent for being in the centre of any slightly ' dubious ' activity that was going on . One story , which spawned a number of variants , concerned a docking operation in front of Admiralty House in Inveraray . Kidder 's craft went aground and , without giving it a moment 's thought , he stripped off his clothes ( except cap ) and went overboard to lay a kedge anchor to winch the craft off the obstruction ... as Commodore Coltart and guests , newly returned from a church service , watched in amazement ! Ken was on the carpet next morning but beat the rap when a kindly Aussie pointed out that the buoy marking the shoal was of the wrong type . It was a middle ground buoy , indicating safe passage on either side . Later the story was embellished in the telling . This time the docking manoeuvre took place in front of the WRNS ( women 's navy service ) training establishment . Kidder ordered his men to strip off , jump into the waters below and free the craft ... all in full view of any WRNS ' lucky ' enough to have been watching . However a WRNS officer was not amused and she lodged a complaint about the exposure of her charges to what we would call today the ' full Monty ! ' End of Training May 1942 . I was so glad to get your letter dated April 9 saying that you had received my first letter . It is a relief to know that they actually do get across . I was beginning to think they were on a one way street , because I had received all of yours . I had n't numbered them but , starting with this one as one , I 'll keep track of all I write . We are through with our training now and are working with the army . Our job does n't require much brain work and I feel I could be learning a lot more if I was back in general service at sea but , if we are wanted here , I guess we must make the most of it . In all the time we have been here , over a month and a half , I have n't even had a chance to go to town and I am afraid we are all getting slightly bushed . For the last week or so , we have had a lot of fun exploring an old silver mine that is about a mile from camp . The mine is owned by the Duke of Argyll , who seems to own everything in these parts , the roads are even privately owned . Several went down to see him last Sunday . He is very interested in Canada , because his uncle , Lord Tweedsmuir was Governor - General . When he came back to the estate , Lord Tweedsmuir built a log cabin and planted a large number of silver maples . They are big trees now and the only ones I have seen since I have been over . I am so glad you are sending a parcel . The one thing we miss more than anything else is good Canadian chocolate but there is no need to try to send too much . English cigarettes are horrible and it is virtually impossible to get woollen clothing . We would all enjoy the occasional magazine , just to look at the food ads . [ Kendall Kidder . ] During wartime , the information servicemen could give in their letters home was very restricted . Kendall 's letters do not , for example , describe the nature of the training , precise locations or times . It was only in the post war period that his wartime experiences and his letters could be put into context . Kendall 's Crew They are just about as good a bunch of lads as you could ever hope for . Here are their names and jobs . - \" I'll kill de guy \" Kirkpatrick my stoker . He is an excellent cook and has made some wonderful stews ( from sheep rustled back in the hills ) . Besides being a good cook he is the best barber in the camp . - Tombstone Leavy . He is second cox 'n and one of the best workers in the crew . He catches sheep for the mess . His pet hobby is raising birds , crows , seagulls and pheasant . - Parrot Mitchell my first cox'n . He is from Calais Maine and knows the Rideouts ( Kidder family friends ) . - Lads from the west coast , Francis and Coverdale . They move and think at an amazing pace , like molasses in January . - \" H'ok \" Gallant a French Canadian from Prince Edward Island . One of the best workers and he has the ability to think for himself in a pinch , which is a big help . - The officer in charge . ( Kidder Himself ) . Landing Craft Types Landing Craft . By the time of the Normandy landings , the range of specialised landing craft had increased enormously , in keeping with technological advances and the changing conduct of warfare . The craft were ; LCA - Landing Craft Assault , LCF - Landing Craft Flak ( anti-aircraft use ) , LCG - Landing Craft Gun , LCGm Landing Craft Gun ( medium ) , LCI - Landing Craft Infantry , LCM - Landing Craft Mechanised , LCOCU - Landing Craft Obstacle Clearance Unit , LCP - Landing Craft Personnel , LCRU - Landing Craft Recovery Unit , LCV ( P ) - Landing Craft Vehicle & Personnel ( American equivalent of LCA ) , LCS - Landing Craft Support , LCT - Landing Craft Tank , LCT ( R ) - Landing Craft Tank ( Rocket ) , LSD - Landing Ship Dock , LSG - Landing Ship Gantry , LSI - Landing Ship Infantry , LSP - Landing Ship Personnel , LST - Landing Ship Tank and LVT - Landing Vehicle Tracked ( also known as amphibian ) . [ Photo ; Harry Trenholme and Kendall Kidder inspecting their troop on the deck of the MV Otranto ( ? ) . ] Kendall went on to be involved in the North Africa landings in Nov 1942 , Sicily in July 1943 , Italy in September 1943 and Normandy in June 1944 . In common with many service personnel , Kendall \" Happy \" Kidder 's war was a surreal mixture of periods of inactivity leading to boredom on occasions and with periods of intense activity and danger , where death and destruction were but a heartbeat away . By the end of June 1944 , the Canadian Combined Operations unit was disbanded although the ferrying service across the channel continued into July and August . On Sept 9 , 1944 , Kendall was granted leave and passage to Canada but returned to the UK in December on an entirely new assignment . A plaque is fixed to the door of a WW2 building at HMS Quebec ( opposite ) , which now serves as the caravan site reception office .
