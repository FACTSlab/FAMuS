Exchangers: In some sentences both participants are expressed by the Subject, and there is no 'with'-phrase (cf example 1). In sentences like this, the Subject is assigned the role role <fen>Exchangers</fen>. In such sentences, the Subject always denotes more than one person, and it is understood that the reciprocal communication takes place between these two (or more) people. The Subject may denote two or more people either through conjunction, as in example 1, or through plurality, as in example 2, or by denoting a group, as in example 3. In each of these cases the role <fen>Exchangers</fen> is assigned. Notice that for nouns in the Exchange frame, it is possible for the <fen>Exchangers</fen> role to be expressed by a prepositional phrase as in example 4.\n<fex>Smithers and Kornfeldt</fex> traded Pez dispensers.\n4.
